And when we brought the Bill for a strong Lokpal in the Parliament,their people opposed it. We said that there should be a Constitutional Lokpal which should function the same way as the Election Commission does  without succumbing to any pressure, he said.Aur Manmohan Singh ji,Congress president Sonia Gandhi ji aur Congress party ne Parliament me Bill rakha BJP ke logon ne,Akali Dal ke logon ne laal button daba kar us Bill ko wahan roka. (When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the Congress introduced the Bill in the Parliament,members of the BJP and Akali Dal stopped it by pressing the red button),said Rahul. Aur jab Bill ruk raha tha to muskurahatein thee inke chehron pekhush they yeh log (And when the Bill was getting stalled,these people had smiles on their faces,they were happy), he added.When the media asked them about what they had done and why,they said that the Bill was not their dream but only that of the Prime Minister,Congress president,Congress Party and Rahul Gandhi. Magar yeh sirf hamara sapna nahin thayeh aam yuvaon ka sapna haiPunjab ke yuvaon ka sapna hai ki bhrastachar kam ho..aur hum isko poor kar ke dikhayenge, said Rahul.Claiming that it was only the Congress which was fighting corruption,Rahul said: Jahan bhi hamare log isme shamil hote hain,hum unko jail main daal dete hainhamare mantra jail mein baithey huye hain. Hum ladte hain,yeh sirf bhashan karte hain,yatrayen karte hain.Narrating how a farmer in Uttar Pradesh asked him to why he got Rs 2 for a kg of potatoes while a potato chips packet that uses only half a potato was selling for Rs 10,Rahul said that only reason for such a situation was that the farmer was not getting the profits of his labour. Humney FDI ki baat ki-ki jo unit lagein kisan ke paas,kheton ke paas lageinuska fayda aap tak pahuncheapko sahi rate miley. Aur ekdum FDI ke khilaaf uthkar Akali Dal aur BJP ke log khade ho gaye, he said,adding that these parties,particularly the BJP,were not actually opposed to FDI but were only opposing it because the government wanted to push for these reforms. He also said that many MPs from these parties acknowledge in the Parliament that FDI will benefit people.Explaining how elections within the Youth Congress in Punjab had empowered the party,Rahul asked the people to support the young candidates who have got an opportunity in politics now. Yahan yuva pratyashi haiNaye ladke ko laiye aur yeh apke liye ladega, Gandhi said referring to Amarinder Singh Raja Warring,a 33-year old Youth Congress worker who has been handpicked by Rahul to contest against PPP chief Manpreet Singh Badal.The Congress general secretary also said that he had met all these youngsters in New Delhi and had asked them to go and fight for the people and their problems after having got the party ticket. He added that they had been told in clear terms that if he got to know about even an iota of corruption against any of them,their political careers will be over.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
1,Groping in the dark as usual,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/groping-in-the-dark-as-usual/story-GsaMvFQskMczAUwrOVOZeK.html,2012-01-02,Hindustan Times,"India traditionally has low energy demand in winter, but this year blackouts have accompanied the dropping mercury. This follows an autumn in which almost every state carried out rolling power cuts. This is not a temporary affair: one of the worst policy failures of both central and state governments the past few years has been in the power sector. The Dark Ages threaten India once more.Good news is hard to find in the Indian energy story. Power stations live hand to mouth when it comes to coal stocks. Indias vaunted offshore gas production is plummeting. Oil subsidies cripple domestic petrochemical investment. Indias dependence on imported fuel is skyrocketing because of the domestic sectors paralysis. There is a sense of dj vu. Just as they did a decade back, State power utilities are swimming in red ink again. Their aggregate losses were Rs 138 billion in 2006-07. Last fiscal year, they reached Rs 445 billion.The power sector is creaking in every rivet. The ultra-mega power projects are an example of the rot that has spread through the system. These showcase power projects lie largely stillborn thanks to fixed power prices that guarantee losses, interest rates that none had dreamt of a half-decade back and a dearth of stable fuel sources. A core problem is the issue of pricing. Both industry and government seem to have made absurdly rosy assumptions about the future of fuel prices, especially regarding that of coal.Natural gas pricing has become a Gordian knot of a wrangle that none can cut. Oil prices are set by a global market that is outside New Delhis control, but thanks to a perverse subsidy and tax regime they have become a political hot potato for both Centre and the states. The coal crisis is a unique product of several years of poorly conceived and poorly coordinated policies in both pricing and sourcing. Plentiful coal has become artificially scarce by whim-sical environmental policies and exacerbated by a continuing failure to break the monopoly of Coal India, a firm the government admits wastes 25% of what it mines.With domestic coal achieving the status of reserve gold and investment fleeing natural gas, Indian industry turned overseas for both. The price of such assets has jumped and foreign countries are limiting such buys. High interest rates, a falling rupee and the countrys current account deficit are placing such overseas purchases beyond Indias reach. India is now more dependent on oil and gas imports than it has ever been before  and is now also a major coal importer as well. Power is a slow-burn crisis in which long-term plans go slowly awry and build up to a major breakdown in the future. India needs to return to the path of pricing and regulatory reform from which it strayed before its energy production goes off a cliff as it did two decades ago."

3,Youth Cong bats for FDI in retail ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120102/jsp/nation/story_14951852.jsp,2012-01-02,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Jan. 1: The Youth Congress has a question: why can some company not buy the potatoes that Punjabs farmers are throwing on the streets and sell them in Kerala where the crops price is as high as Rs 18 a kg? The answer, for the outfit being groomed under the guidance of Rahul Gandhi, is foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail. Thats the message from the monthly Youth Congress newsletter, which has now been upgraded to a well-produced magazine titled Yuva Bharat. One article in the journal argues that the opposition to FDI in retail only benefits the middlemen and political parties who make a living out of peoples misery. It doesnt name the Trinamul Congress, which staunchly opposed retail FDI a few weeks ago, but has a subtle message for it: The Left has been voted out of West Bengal because they did not understand their economics. The article, whose authors are not essentially from the Congress, cites how Parliament was stalled on the FDI issue by parties of different ideological hues, from saffron to red, who are all out of sync with what the nation wants. It recalls what Rahul had told a rally in Farrukhabad: FDI is more about potato farmers of central UP and Punjab than about anxious executives of multi-national corporations planning investment in India. The Youth Congress, which has left the parent party far behind in matters of organisational elections and institutional training, seems to have beaten it in the quality of its journal, too. The Congress mouthpiece is a shoddily produced publication that contains old speeches of Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh in addition to sycophantic articles by in-house writers. Yuva Bharat, on the other hand, offers a wider perspective on a range of subjects, dealt with by authors from varied fields. If there is a party-centric article on the recent convention of elected Youth Congress office-bearers, there are write-ups by outsiders ranging from cricket experts to a JP Morgan executive who is an IIT and IIM alumnus. The cricket World Cup triumph, however, has been treated from the angle of the youths aspirations."

5,Mamata puts onus on Centre for farmers' plight,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mamata-puts-onus-on-centre-for-farmers-plight/article2773445.ece,2012-01-04,The Hindu,"Even as the State Government is facing criticism from several quarters with reports of ten farmers committing suicide in the last few months Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee here on Tuesday puts the onus for the crisis on the Centre.Alleging that both the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Congress are indulging in false propaganda against the State Government on the issue, Ms Banerjee said that she wished to clarify that the minimum support price of paddy the low amount contributing to the woes of the farmers-- was not fixed by the State but by the Centre.While Left peasant organisations have called for a cessation of all agricultural activity across the State on Wednesday in protest against conditions the farmers are having to face the State's unit of the Congress has called for a demonstration in the city on the same day to highlight the crisis facing the farmers.Even I want prices (minimum support price) to rise But even if I wish I cannot do it, Ms Banerjee said addressing a press conference at the State Secretariat.Ms. Banerjee said that the prices of fertilisers have not been increased by the State. It was the Centre that has lifted the subsidies on it which has increased the burden on farmers.The prices of fertilisers were decontrolled in 2010 when the CPI (M) Government was in power, she said.Ms Banerjee said that she has discussed the issue of high prices of fertilisers with Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and also written to the Centre about it.The Left Parties have pointed out that the State Government has dismantled the entire mechanism of buying produce from the farmers by introducing a system in which farmers have to sell paddy at rice mills and receive payments only through cheques.Ms Banerjee however defended the move saying that the government wants the money to go directly to farmers and not any agents.She said that for potato farmers the government has made arrangements that the crops will be kept for a longer period in cold storages.We have set aside Rs 10 crore so that farmers can are able to export their potatoes, Ms Banerjee said.The Chief Minister said that the problems faced by farmers were a result of the absence of planning on the part of the earlier Government and her Government has had to start from scratch.Ms Banerjee said that the government is setting up Kisan Mandi' in every block and trying to arrange for insurance for farmers."
6,"Production looks up, farmers downcast",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/production-looks-up-farmers-downcast/article2773051.ece,2012-01-04,The Hindu,"Buoyed by a record food production (241.56 million tonnes) in 2010-11 and expectation of the highest ever (123.95 million tonnes) output in kharif of 2011-12, the Centre has projected a total output of 245 million tonnes in 2011-12. This, despite the the sown area being lower in wheat, oilseeds, pulses and coarse grains this rabi season. Rabi paddy, though, has improved over last year.Agriculture Ministry officials appear satisfied with the progress made in 2011(calendar year). In fact, the Ministry recommended lifting of the ban on export of wheat and rice in view of the comfortable stock position. Wheat exports, prohibited since October 2007, have been allowed under Open General Licence since September 2011.Of special significance to the officials is that the major increase in foodgrains production has come from the non-traditional States of Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat.However, the year was also marked by continuing suicide by farmers, testifying to the fact that the growers remain in debt and are distressed, not getting remunerative price for their produce. Recently, Punjab farmers threw away their potato produce as it did not fetch them enough even to cover the input costs. There is also a simmering discontent among farmers over the shortfall in fertilizers.In Andhra Pradesh, farmers have taken a crop holiday and Punjab farmers are threatening to do the same. In fact, there are worrisome reports of Punjab farmers shifting from traditional to cash crops like sweat peas and maize this rabi. In recent years, maize, a cash crop, has emerged as a preference for its requirement in the poultry sector. With the problem of storage (of wheat and rice) staring the government in the face, some diversification is acceptable to it, especially as the requirement of foodgrains for its mandatory obligation under the National Food Security Bill is still far away.ControversyThe Bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha during the winter session, has been referred to the Standing Committee. In any case, the passage of the Bill is embroiled in a controversy over the Socio-Economic Caste Census that is supposed to facilitate identification of beneficiaries. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have raised objections. At the same time, a technical panel in the Planning Commission has been asked to look into the poverty estimates recommended by the Suresh Tendulkar Committee.All of this was reflected in the difficulty Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar faced in responding to the Rajya Sabha debate on the agrarian crisis and farmers' suicides. A cornered Minister took refuge in the fact that several issues related to agriculture such as irrigation, power, fertilizers, credit and storage were not within the purview of his Ministry. However, cutting across party lines, Opposition members did not relent until Mr. Pawar came up with the suggestion to form a House committee to study the matter.For the record, with a paltry allocation of Rs. 400 crore, the Agriculture Ministry turned its focus during 2011 to enhancing production in the eastern States of Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, eastern Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna. The allocation is considered poor by most States as it has to be implemented in a difficult terrain with poor infrastructure.Under the National Food Security Mission for crop development, the best achievement so far is in pulses: from a stagnating level of 14.5 million tonnes over the past 15 years, the production in 2010-11 reached 18.09 million tonnes. The adoption of 60,000 pulses villages gave a boost to the programme.Pigeon pea genomeRecently, Indian Council of Agriculture Research scientists, in collaboration with State Agriculture Universities and Banaras Hindu University, succeeded in decoding the pigeon pea (arhar) genome. Use of pigeon pea germ plasm resources is expected to accelerate the development of new varieties and hybrids brightening up the chances of higher productivity of pulses.During the year, the government set up the Norman Borlaug Institute for South Asia with centres in Ludhiana (Punjab), Samastipur (Bihar) and Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh). The institute will collaborate with others globally to meet food security challenges.The ICAR also launched a National Initiative on Climate-Resilient Agriculture for conducting research in adaptation and mitigation to climate change in crops, livestock and fisheries, and for natural resource management.All in all, the year that went by was a lucky one for crop production, in that the monsoon was favourable. The challenges in the coming year are high input costs, fertilizer shortage, making agriculture remunerative and finding storage space for farm produce, not to mention the wait and watch for a normal monsoon."
7,Food inflation dips to -3.36 percent; RBI may cut rates,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/216883/food-inflation-dips-336-percent.html,2012-01-05,Deccan Herald,"New Delhi, Jan 5 (IANS) 18:57 ISTThe sharp drop in food inflation and easing in overall inflationary pressure may prompt the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut policy rates in its next monetary policy review later this month.The annual food inflation fell to -3.36 percent for the week ended Dec 24, as compared to 0.42 percent in the previous week and 20.84 percent during the corresponding week of last year.""There has been substantial improvement. Food inflation has turned negative for the first time in recent memory,"" Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters, reacting on the weekly data.Food inflation during the week under review was the lowest since April 2006. After remaining near double-digit for almost two years, food inflation has dropped sharply in the last two months. It has dipped for the ninth consecutive week.It came down to single-digit in the second week of November and has slid consistently since then. It was recorded at 10.63 percent for the week ended Nov 5. The sharp decline in food inflation is partly because of the base effect and also improved supply of seasonal crops. During the corresponding weeks of last year, annual inflation was almost near 20 percent.The data released by the ministry of commerce and industry showed the prices of vegetables were less than half during the week when compared to the prices in the corresponding week of last year.Onions became cheaper by 73.74 percent while the price of potatoes dropped by 34.01 percent year-on-year. Inflation in overall primary articles, which has 20.12 percent weightage in the wholesale price index, also dropped sharply to 0.10 percent for the week ended Dec 24 as compared to 2.70 percent in the previous week and 22.68 percent in the corresponding week of last year.However, fuel and power inflation rose marginally to 14.60 percent during the week under review as compared to 14.37 percent in the previous week. Economists said the recent drop in food inflation and easing in overall inflationary pressure may prompt the central bank to cut interest rates.""The environment appears to be in favour of the Reserve Bank of India reversing its monetary policy stance,"" said C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Minister's economic advisory council.The RBI last month kept policy rates unchanged after hiking the key rates 13 times since the beginning of 2010. Rangarajan said food inflation was likely to remain near zero or in the negative territory till March.""This was expected as the seasonal trend has caused vegetable prices to come down in the recent months. I see food inflation negative in January and negative or close to zero by March.""The fall in food inflation has raised hopes of a decline in headline inflation based on the wholesale price index which, according to the latest available data, was recorded at 9.11 percent in November.Rangarajan said the overall inflation would fall below 7 percent by the end of the current financial year.The following are the yearly rise and fall in prices in the week under review of some main commodities that form the sub-index for food articles:Onions: (-) 73.74 percentVegetables: (-) 50.22 percentFruits: 10.87 percentPotatoes: (-) 34.01 percentEggs, meat, fish: 13.82 percentCereals: 1.97 percentRice: 1.46 percentWheat: (-) 3.41 percentPulses: 13.85 percent"

9,Contract farming way out for potato growers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Contract-farming-way-out-for-potato-growers/articleshow/11370291.cms,2012-01-05,The Times Of India,"BANKURA: Plummeting potato prices for three consecutive years have prompted farmers to switch to contract farming this season. The reason is obvious. No one wants to get burdened with loans after the farming when it costs Rs 14,000 a bigha. The trend is picking up in as many as 19 blocks of south Bengal - Hooghly, Burdwan, Birbhum, West Midnapore, Howrah and Bankura.""Potato farming is becoming disastrous with packets of the crop kept in cold storage offered at 50 paisa or one rupee a kilo without any taker,"" said Meghanjan Dutta of Shiromonipur village under Kotulpur block in Bankura.For them, tying up with the PepsiCo India is the only alternative for an assured return. ""It's not that they are offering much. But at least we are assured of the return six months ago. Also, we don't have to take the produce to the local mundi or transport them to the cold storage on our own,"" Dutta said.What is the contract? The farmer gives his land and labour. PepsiCo officials provide the seed - Atlanta and Chipsona - different from the traditional Jyoti or Pokhraj variety and the technology support. They supervise the cultivation and give advice to farmers from time to time. After the yield they take the produce to their own storage. The farmer gets Rs 6 for each kilo of potato. Advantage for the hapless farmers is that they get to know about the procurement price while they start sowing the seeds. They get crop insurance, seeds and loans from PepsiCo agents that they need to pay after the yield.Meghraj Dutta, owner of 6 bigha of land, has had enough of traditional cultivation.""We didn't take to contract farming last year though the PepsiCo came to our village. We thought that the price on offer by the company was too low compared to the profit we made in the open market four years ago. But it didn't happen. Prices kept falling despite the rising input costs such as seeds, fertilisers, insecticides. I can't take it any more. I thus opted for contract farming though the procurement price is not high. The second thing is that the company won't take all the produce. It will grade potatoes and take those that suit its requirement. It becomes difficult to sell the reject low sugar potato variety. But then it is better than what we are facing now,"" Dutta said.Owner of two-bigha land Chittaranjan Nandi of Panahar village has also joined hands with PepsiCo. ""With the profit I earned five years ago I married off my two daughters. Now I can't support my son studying at the Chandernagore Government College even. I can't take the risk,"" Nandi said. Shyamsundar Guin from the Galsi block in Burdwan is also going for contract farming on 10 bighas of land. ""Some farmers in the Kalna block have also opted for contract farming,"" Guin said.Sensing the mood, the PepsiCo Holdings India has doubled its target this year. It plans to rope in 9,000 farmers doing the job in 5,000 acres of land. Assistant manager PepsiCo, Fritolay division Prabal Roy said: ""We are not going for direct purchase from farmers. We are procuring the produce through vendors. Last year purchased 10,000 tonnes of potato and sent it our stores. We plan to procure 20,000 tonnes this season. We won't release this potato in the market. We thank the state government and officials of allowing us approach the villagers.""Incidentally, PepsiCo made an entry into potato farming in Hooghly during the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government. During the Left Front tenure, it could not make foray in Bankura because of political opposition.Sukdeb Shyam of Baghrol village in Bankura, however, stood out as one who has taken to traditional farming even this season. Shyam owns 15 bighas of land and is in a position to sustain the loss. ""I suffered a loss of Rs 7,000. But I am not into contract farming. I hope to make profits from the traditional variety this season. The price on offer by the PepsiCo is not encouraging,"" said Shyam.Deputy director Bankura agriculture division Abani Mohan Hazra said PepsiCo approached the division. ""Their (PepsiCo) officials told us that the company had been carrying out commercial farming on an experimental basis. This time, they want to go for it in a big way. With farmers in distress we chose not prevent them. We asked them to get in touch with the farmers directly and carry out the cultivation if they agree,"" Hazra said."
10,Congress blames Mamata for farmers' plight,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/congress-blames-mamata-for-farmers-plight/article2776569.ece,2012-01-05,The Hindu,"The State Congress on Wednesday called for a State-wide agitation against the Trinamool Congress-led government for its failure to improve the condition of farmers in the State, some of whom have committed suicide.On Tuesday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had put the blame on the Centre and claimed that neither could she raise the minimum support price of crops for farmers nor reduce the prices of fertilisers.At a demonstration to highlights the concerns of farmers, Congress leaders said that the lacuna lies in the implementation of the State Government and not in the Centre's policies, which are the same for all the States. The crisis faced by the farmers is that they are not getting the minimum support price of Rs. 1080 per quintal fixed by the Centre. The government does not have any mechanism to buy the produce from the farmers, said West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee President Pradip Bhattacharya.Mr. Bhattacharya explained that when farmers have to sell their produce at rice mills and are authorised to get the payments only through cheques, they are forced to sell their produce to local agents at a lower price. He directed Congress workers to hold demonstrations in front of the offices all district magistrates during the month to highlight the issue.The State Government has fixed a procurement target of 20-lakh metric tonnes of food grains, but so far just a little over two-lakh metric tonnes have been procured, State Irrigation Minister Manas Bhunia said.Pointing out the shortcomings of the State Government in its management in the agriculture sector, Mr. Bhunia also said that of the 1018 rice mills in the State, 350 are closed. He added that the public distribution system, through its 28,873 ration shops, was not functioning well.Congress MP Deepa Dasmunshi alleged that farmers are selling paddy at a far lower price than they used to sell during the Left Front Government. While the farmers used to sell (one quintal of paddy) for Rs.700 to Rs.800 during the Left Front's rule, today under the government of ma, mati, manush , they are forced to sell the same produce for Rs.500 to 600, she said.Jute cultivators and potato growers were also being forced into distress sales of their produce, the Congress leaders said.Criticising the Trinamool Congress opposition to foreign direct investment in the retail sector, the State Congress leadership alleged that the party has deprived farmers of the opportunity to get higher prices for their produce."

Food inflation has turned negative for the first time in recent memory, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said.The Prime Ministers economic advisory panel favoured rate cuts by the Reserve Bank and hoped headline inflation, too, would fall below the projected 7 per cent by March-end.Food inflation stood at 0.42 per cent in the week ended December 17. It was 21 per cent in the corresponding week of 2010. This was the first time the food price index has declined since April 2006.The fall in food prices have been substantial since the first week of November, when food inflation stood at double-digits. Experts attributed the decline to the high base of the previous year and to good kharif output.Food inflation has turned negative on the favourable impact of lower food prices and elevated base effect. It is probable that food inflation might remain subdued till mid-February, Standard Chartered economist Anubhuti Sahay said.According to official data, onion became cheaper by 73.74 per cent year-on-year during the week, while potato prices were down 34.01 per cent. Prices of wheat fell 3.41 per cent. Overall, vegetables became 50.22 per cent cheaper during the week ended December 24.However, fuel inflation accelerated to 14.6 per cent.

Since 2010, the 53-year-old farmer has not been able to recover the cost of cultivating potatoes on 5,000 acres of land. The reason: a glut production and no space in cold storages across Punjab.In 2010, I recovered only 80% of the cost of production and in 2011 I managed to get back only 50% in spite of a bumper crop, a distraught Sangha told HT. There are 6,000 tonnes of crop in my cold storage alone.Potato is grown on nearly 80,000 hectares in Punjab, primarily in the Doaba belt  area between Sutlej and Beas rivers that comprises of Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr and Hoshiarpur districts.With a bumper harvest this season as well, prices of potatoes have hit an all-time low of R1 per kg. Farmers say that due to increased farming input costs, growing potato costs them at least Rs 5 per kg.Farmers also feel the governments freight subsidy of 50 paise per kg for transportation within the country and Rs 1.50 for export is too meagre.Fresh crop is ready for arrival and the government has left us in the lurch with no solution to clear up the piled stock. I am sending my crop to Guwahati, but I cant even recover the cost of freight, Sangha said.Sangha has urged the Central Potato Board to protect the interests of potato farmers by encouraging versatile use of the tuber crop."
15,Food prices drop for first time in 6 years,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Food-prices-drop-for-first-time-in-6-years/articleshow/11380946.cms,2012-01-06,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Food inflation turned negative for the first time in nearly six years in late December as prices of vegetables, potato, onion and some cereals fell sharply, prompting analysts to say the data provided headroom for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates and support growth.Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Thursday showed food inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index, fell by 3.36%  sharply lower than the previous week's 0.42%. It stood at 20.84% in the same year-ago period.Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said there was substantial improvement in the food inflation situation. ""Food inflation has turned negative for the first time in recent memory,"" he told reporters.Thursday's data showed vegetable prices fell by 50.22% year-on-year while potato prices declined an annual 34.01%. Onion prices which had shot up last year fell by 73.74% year-on-year. Wheat prices declined an annual 3.41%. But price of pulses firmed up an annual 13.85% during the week under review.C Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, said he expects the overall inflation to ease below 7% by end-March. Policymakers have been wrong-footed several times in the past two years while predicting the inflation trend.""We have to wait for December inflation figures to see if the non-food manufacturing numbers have also followed the same path. The December numbers will indicate when and how RBI will act,"" he told reporters. ""The environment appears to be in favour of the Reserve Bank reversing its monetary policy stance,"" he said.Soaring food prices for more than one year have hit household budgets and contributed significantly to overall inflation which has hovered around double-digits.Economists said the decline in food inflation was largely due to a statistical base effect but also showed that supplies had improved significantly.""The supplies have been relatively better. We expect December inflation around 7.5% and expect the RBI to first reduce the cash reserve ratio in its January policy and then follow it up with a rate cut over the next two-three months,"" said Samiran Chakraborty, economist at Standard Chartered Bank. Overall inflation in November remained above the 9% mark and data for December is expected next week.Stubborn inflation had forced the RBI to raise interest rates 13 times since last March. It announced a pause in its tightening cycle in the recent policy review. The central bank has said its strategy may now change to supporting growth if there is significant evidence of inflation easing. Analysts and bankers expect the RBI to cut rates soon. The economy is expected to grow around 7.5%, sharply slower than the previous estimate of over 9%.The index for food articles group declined by 0.2% to 190.0 from 190.3 for the previous week due to lower prices of jowar, fruits and vegetables, gram and moong (1% each). But prices of chicken (3%), egg, ragi and maize (2% each) moved up.The data also showed that prices of fruits, milk, egg, meat and fish prices remained stubborn. Protein-based items have remained stubborn due to rising demand and economists say they still remain as pressure points.""The trend of sharp decline in food inflation has increased the probability of interest rate cuts,"" said D K Joshi, chief economist at ratings agency Crisil.The government is exulting in the fact that food inflation has consistently seen a downward swing in recent times. It has now slumped further to settle at -3.36%. Yet the benefits haven't percolated down to the consumers, who are at the receiving end of retail bullying. They are now questioning the significance of an index that fails to reflect ground reality.Food prices in October and November, Delhiites say, were so high that a marginal drop in December made no difference to their lives. Moreover, depending on where they stay and who they buy their vegetables from, Delhiites will be spending differently on the same food.Rama Ghosh, a resident of CR Park, says other than onions and potatoes, all other vegetables either cost the same as they did in November, or there is a very minute difference in their prices. ""I buy vegetables in Govindpuri where the prices have always been lower and the fall in rates has also been sharper,"" she says.Anita Singh of east Delhi claims prices have come down sharply since November. ""I've been buying cauliflower for Rs 20 per kilo,"" she says. But Ruma Roy from Gulmohar Park disagrees. She has been purchasing cauliflower for Rs 30 per kilo, ""a preposterous price for a winter vegetable"".""Wholesale prices in December 2011 were much lower compared to prices in December 2010. Even now, prices are lower than what they were a month ago, but retailers continue to milk consumers for what they are worth,"" says an official of Azadpur mandi.With prices of several commodities having gone up in 2011, including fuel, milk, dairy products and LPG, consumers say that a minor drop in vegetable prices goes almost unnoticed. ""I don't know whether such marginal reduction in prices should be highlighted by the government. In fact, if prices of potatoes and onions have reduced, the prices of other items are going up. People cannot eat only potatoes. Dal specially is very expensive  Chana dal is about Rs 70 per kg. I have five children at home. Do you think we can manage our expenses like this? We often fail to give children the kind of food they want to eat,"" says Saroj Chalia, a resident of Rohini.Many feel that the claims of the government or economists have not translated to any benefit for the consumer. ""These are mere claims. There is hardly any change in prices. Rather, the change is so small that it doesn't matter. I think the pricing of food products also depends on the area. I am a resident of Vasant Kunj in south Delhi. It is very expensive to shop there. Arhar dal, for instance, is Rs 80 per kg. We have to compromise on our purchases as we are not able to buy all kinds of dal,"" says Shefali Mishra, a DU professor.Rajan Sachdev, owner of a grocery store at INA, feels the difference is too marginal to count. "" The change in prices is so slight that the common man doesn't realize. I also feel that the prices of essentials are skyrocketing. If not potatoes and onions, take into account pulses and lentils. Do you think the poor can survive like this?"" he says."
16,Food inflation in negative territory,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/food-inflation-in-negative-territory/article2779098.ece,2012-01-06,The Hindu,"For the first time in nearly six years, food inflation entered negative territory, plunging to (-) 3.36 during the week ended December 24 from 0.42 per cent in the previous week, mainly owing to a sharp dip in prices of onions, potatoes and other seasonal vegetables.The slump into the negative zone for the first time as per the available WPI (wholesale price index) food inflation data with 2004-05 as the base year appears to have paved the way for a much-awaited cut in key rates by the Reserve Bank of India during its next monetary policy review slated for January 24.High base effectThis is despite the fact that the sharp decline is partly owing to the effect of a high base as food inflation during the like week in 2010 was at a high of 21 per cent. Nevertheless, enthused by the respite from high food prices, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said: There has been substantial improvement. Food inflation has turned negative for the first time in the recent memory.''The figures speak for themselves.As per the official data released here on Thursday, onion prices slumped by 73.74 per cent during the week while potatoes also turned cheaper by 34.01 per cent on a year-on-year basis.Prices of vegetables, on the whole, fell by 50.22 per cent, as did wheat by 3.41 per cent.Compared to prices of edibles during the first week of November when food inflation stood pegged at double digits, the slide in prices has been substantial.Policy stanceCommenting on the WPI data, Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) Chairman C. Rangarajan said: The environment appears to be in favour of the RBI reversing its monetary policy stance.Dr. Rangarajan viewed that the decline in food inflation would also help bring down headline inflation  which factors in manufactured items, fuels and non-food primary articles  to below 7 per cent by March this year.Evidently, having hiked interest rates 13 times since March last year, followed by a pause in December, the stage is set for the Reserve Bank of India to cut its key policy rates so as to induce overall consumer demand and spur industrial growth."

Criticising the government for failing on both the sectors,agriculture and industries,he said: The government has taken the state backward in both industry and agriculture  It has not taken a single step towards industrialisation compared to what was done by us. No new industry has come up under the new regime, said the CPM leader while addressing a party rally here.He claimed that industries like JSW steel,Wipro,Infosys and Cognizant had set foot in the state during the Left Front rule,but now investors are realising that this government will not do anything to bring new industry.Bhattacharjee said that although there had been a good harvest of aman paddy this season,the cultivators could not sell the produce because neither the government nor the cooperatives were buying the crops.I recently went to Burdwan. There,the paddy growers are running from pillar to post trying to sell their harvest. Even if they can,they are getting Rs 600 to 700 per quintal,instead of the MSP of Rs 1,100, Bhattacharjee said.He said farmers are also reluctant to go for potato and boro cultivation for fear that they would not be able to sell their produce.Although the erstwhile Left Front government had taken steps to buy jute at Rs 4,000 per quintal,the price now stands at Rs 2,000. Why is this? No one seems to know and no one is doing anything. Ministers are giving differing statements. This has never happened when we were in the government, Bhattacharjee said.On the recent incidents of violence in some colleges in the state,Bhattacharjee alleged that law and order is on the brink of a breakdown under the present government.The CPM leader also found fault with the signing of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) agreement in Darjeeling,initiated by the Mamata Banerjee government,saying it would only boost the demand for Gorkhaland and not bring development of any sort.There is no reason to think that agitators would abandon the demand for Gorkhaland with the signing of the GTA agreement. It will only foment the demand. Darjeeling is sitting on a powder keg. It will erupt any day, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Now, we receive 450 -500 trucks of different fresh vegetables against the supply of 300 to 325 trucks in November. Rates of some seasonal vegetables have plummeted to lowest in the year due to fresh supply.""He added, ""The situation was good in December, it is better now and will continue to remain better for the whole of January because these vegetables were planted after Diwali and are now ready for consumption.""Vegetables like green garlic, tomato, cauliflower and cabbage come to Surat in very large quantity from Nashik in Maharashtra. Similarly, local products like papdi, sweet potato and brinjal come everyday from the farms of Surat, Tapi and Navsari districts.In the retail market, this has led to vegetables in plenty and abundant availability giving households a relief. ""We are breathing a little easy at present as fresh vegetables are available in the market at decent prices. Making winter delicacy undhiyu has become affordable now,"" a resident of Adajan Vanita Resawala said.

21,‘Negative food inflation is insignificant’,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Negative-food-inflation-is-insignificant/articleshow/11467471.cms,2012-01-13,The Times Of India,"PUNE: The negative food inflation in the last week of December 2011 has not provided much relief to the middle class. Experts say that the fall in prices of a handful of agricultural commodities such as onion and potato has led to the decline in the food index, which is a temporary phenomenon as yield of the ongoing rabi season is expected to be low.The Union government figures show that, in the last week of December 2011 the annual inflation fell to -2.9 per cent. The sharp decline in food inflation is partly because of the base effect and also due to the improved supply of seasonal crops. During the corresponding week of 2010, annual inflation was nearly 20%.For instance, the prices of onion in the retail market were around Rs 70 per kg in January 2010, compared to around Rs 10 per kg now. The cultivation period of onion is longer than leafy vegetables or fruits. In case of onion, the period from sowing to harvesting is around three to four months. Hence, once the production is affected it has a longer-term effect on the market. In case of leafy vegetables or fruits, the prices continue to fluctuate and do not show any upward change for months.Rohini Sahni, head of the department of economics, University of Pune, told TOI: ""The fluctuation range of onion crop is higher than that of vegetables. Such difference in price variation of various crops reflects in the indices. Due to the higher range of fluctuation, onion carries more weight and holds higher influential position in food index compared to other vegetables. Negative inflation means the prices of a few crops drop drastically, while prices of the remaining crops come down or move up only slightly. Onion, being an influential crop, contributed in bringing down the index.""Sahni added, ""There are two factors in deciding the prices of vegetables and foodgrains, which seem to have been ignored so far. The rise in transportation cost due to increase in fuel price and the rise in production cost are keeping the prices on an upward swing. The profit margin might have been compromised, but the chances of prices crashing are unlikely. Putting all the input costs together, the farmers are compelled to sell their produce at higher prices, which has a cascading effect on the wholesale and retail markets.""Another price defining factor is the local element, where prices are decided on the economic profile of a certain locality than the actual market trends, she said. ""Vegetables like fenugreek, spinach, brinjal and potato carry different prices in areas like Deccan Gymkhana, Model Colony, Mahatma Phule Mandai and Mangalwar Peth, though all the vegetable vendors source their goods from the Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is the wholesale market. Such local factors are not counted while calculating the indices. The inputs for such calculation have to be comprehensive and should represent all sectors of the society.""Abhay Tilak, faculty member at the Indian School of Political Economy, said: ""The change in the indices looks temporary as the rabi crop is yet to be harvested. A government report says that the area under rabi cultivation has gone down because there was little post-monsoon rainfall. It means, the rabi production would decline and prices will go up.""Sumedha Karmarkar, a housewife from Model Colony, said: ""I went to the retail vendor to buy vegetables and found that there is hardly any reduction in prices. When I asked the vendor about the increased supply of vegetables, I was told that vegetables are supplied from distant locations. The fuel prices are also high, which adds to the transportation cost, hence prices will not fall, though the supply has increased. It may help in stabilizing the prices but all depends on the daily supply.""Now, I do not take news about negative inflation very seriously, Karmarkar said. The prices of lady finger, cucumber and tomato were around Rs 40, Rs 25 and Rs 20 per kg in November last year. Today, the prices of same commodities are Rs 36, Rs 20, Rs 16, which is not very low, she added."

Net profit at $458 million was up 15.4% for the year, and 11.4% over Q2. The biggest surprise was the 3-percentage-point rise in operating margins to 31.7%.While the continuing economic crisis in the US and Europe - from where Infosys gets 86% of its revenues - is definitely a factor, the weak Q4 guidance comes on the heels of the company struggling in recent quarters with its earnings.SD Shibulal, the new CEO of the company, attributed the flat Q4 revenue projection to ""the lack of velocity in the business,"" insisting it's a ""reflection of the market situation"" .Food inflation remains in negative zoneNew Delhi: A substantial fall in prices of vegetables, including that of potatoes and onions, led to food inflation slipping to minus 2.90% on December 31 - the second week in a row that it has remained in the negative zone.A happy finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said, ""Food inflation is still negative...

Unable to get the right price for his potato yield, Rabindranath Patra, 28, a resident of Ghanashyampur village under Begpur gram panchayat, took pesticide on Saturday. He was admitted to Kalna subdivisional hospital where he died at 3.10am on Sunday.Talking to TOI, his widow Jharna Patra said: ""My husband cultivated potato on five cottahs of land. He had also taken loan from a self help group and had stocked up potatoes in the cold storage against potato bonds. But he was driven to frustration when the potato bonds failed to earn money.""Kalna SDO Sumita Bagchi, however, said that the police and excise officials vandalized his illegal hooch den few months ago and since then Patra was feeling insecure which led him to suicide.A number of villagers claimed that they had not got any money from the potato bonds. A farmer Amar Sarkar said that he had purchased bonds for two thousand packets of potato at Rs 250 per packet but the market price is nil today. ""Most cold storage owners have denied us price of the potato bonds saying that we have reached late,"" Sarkar alleged.CPM-backed Krisak Sabha leader Madan Ghosh said that though the Trinamool government is keen on providing cash compensation to AMRI and hooch victims but is silent about the farmers who have committed suicide.""The state has no infrastructure for agriculture and the government has no clear cut agricultural policythough the Ma,maati, manusher government has spent Rs.1.5 crores for beach festival in Digha for the rich people,"" Ghosh alleged. Krishak Sabha is now planning statewide agitation on the issue of farmer suicides.Rabindranath Patra (28), a small and marginal potato farmer committed suicide by consuming pesticide at Ghanashyampur village in Begpur gram panchayet area under Kalna Police Station here at wee hours today. He has consumed pesticide yesterday and his family admitted him to Kalna sub divisional hospital, where eventually he expired at around 3.10 AM today.The victim's father late Bhupen Patra and his brother, both landless labourers received ten cottahs of land from the previous state government as patta. After his death his two sons- Rabindranath and Sambhunath became owners of the five cottahs of land. Sambhunath is a driver by profession and entrusted Rabindranath to do the cultivation on his portion too.Madan Ghosh, krisak sabha leader and senior CPM leader said that the trinamul government is keen on providing cash compensation to AMRI and hooch victims but is silent on the farmers who have committed suicides in the state. ""There is no infrastructure for agriculture in the state and the government has no clear cut agricultural policy though the Ma,maati, manusher government has spent Rs.1.5 crores for beach festival in Digha for the rich people,""he alleged. Krishak sabha is now planning statewide agitation on the issue of farmer's suicides.The congress, BJP and the CPI has also expressed anxiety of the growing incidents of suicide in the Burdwan district, which many years ago World Bank President, Paul McNamara described as the rice bowl of the state."

The WPI inflation came down sharply in December, easing from 9.11 per cent in the previous month on the back of cheaper onion, potato and wheat prices during December.Official data showed vegetables were cheaper by 34.18 per cent and wheat by 3.81 per cent on an annual basis. Potato and onion prices also fell by 35.45 per cent and 60.45 per cent year-on-year during December.Prices of food items eased to 0.74 per in December from 8.54 per cent in the previous month. The Manufacturing index, however, went up since November. Manufacturing inflation was at 7.41 per cent compared with 7.7 per cent in the previous month.Inflation in the fuel and power segment stood at 14.91 per cent on an annual basis in December, as against 15.48 per cent in the previous month.The depreciation in the rupee vis-a-vis dollar has sharply pushed up fuel inflation as India imports nearly 80 per cent of its crude requirements for which it has to pay in dollars.Analysts said, core inflation, which excludes food and fuel prices, still remained close to 8 per cent suggesting the Reserve Bank of India may not go in for a reversal in interest rate cycle as early as this month.Although the Central bank left its key lending rate unchanged at its December policy review, it has risen it 13 times since March 2010 lifting repo rate by 375 basis points and reverse repo by 425 bps. The bank will next meet no January 24 to review monetary policy.Inflation in overall primary articles stood at 3.07 per cent in December, compared to 8.53 per cent in November."

This was the lowest reading since December 2009 when it stood at 7.15%.The sharp moderation in inflation comes as a huge relief for policymakers who have been battling stubborn price pressures since 2010. Inflation has remained above 9% for a significant period piling pressure on the government and upsetting household budgets.Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said he was confident that the easing trend would be sustained in the months ahead. He reiterated that the headline inflation should be between 6% and 7% by March-end. Mukherjee said the recent inflation and industrial output data indicated some improvement in the overall macro-economic situation and hinted at policy correctives to consolidate the trend.But Mukherjee said the manufactured inflation and inflation in the power group of items continued to be a cause of concern. The index for the manufactured products group rose by 0.6% to 140.6 from 139.8 for the previous month.Data showed the index for food articles group declined by 3.1% to 190.8 from 196.9 for the previous month due to lower prices of fruits and vegetables (13%), condiments and spices (6%), urad (5%), chicken (3%), tea (2%) and jowar, rice, arhar, ragi and barley (1% each). But prices of pork (8%), river fish (5%), maize (3%), bajra, egg, beef and buffalo meat, mutton and masur (2% each) and gram, coffee, wheat and milk (1% each) moved up.Vegetable prices declined an annual 34.81% while onion prices dropped 60.45% year-on-year. Potato prices declined 35.45% year-on-year. Milk, eggs, meat and fish and pulses prices remained robust.Economists said the RBI would prefer to wait and watch to see how the price situation unfolds in the weeks ahead and then take a call on cutting interest rates.""There was never a strong case for a rate cut at the upcoming January 24 policy review, in our view. We maintain our view that the RBI will likely cut rates after the federal budget (mid-March),"" said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at CLSA in Singapore.""However, a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) should not be totally ruled out because of the need for a sustainable solution to address the excessively tight money market liquidity situation,"" Malik said. The RBI will review monetary policy on January 24."

On Saturday, paddy farmer Tapas Majhi hanged himself in Suluntu village in Purbasthali, Burdwan. A day later, potato farmer Rabindranath Patra, 28, of Begpur in Burdwan took pesticide and died in hospital.The families of both victims say they were driven to despair because they did not get the proper price for their crops. The administration, however, denied that any of the suicides were due to crop prices or debt.Even in Tuesday's case, the administration refuses to admit that Ganesh Durlabh committed suicide because he could not sell his harvest. The police say he killed himself due to a domestic squabble with his son and daughter-in-law. Ganesh's wife, Asha, however has a different story. She said that he was unable to sell off the potatoes he had sown last year and suffered a huge debt this year because he could not sell his paddy crop or even the few vegetables he had grown. ""He had taken a loan of Rs 3,000 from the Panishaula agri-credit society and Rs 10,000 from elsewhere. There was no way he could have paid off the debt,"" she said. Bandipur's gram panchayat pradhan Kanchan Durlabh made the same allegation. The panchayat is run by the CPM.Chandannagore SDPO Tathagata Chowdhury, however, contradicted these claims. ""We enquired into the matter. They have a recurring family dispute which led to this death. We spoke with locals and family members. The victim did not agree to his son's marriage. He had constant squabbles with his son and daughter-in-law. In fact they had one last night itself,"" he said.Haripal MLA Becharam Manna, one of the leaders of the Singur movement, backed the administration. ""The victim was also a decorator. Whenever a cultivator heads for his fields, he knows it might lead to a loss. There are other farmers there, why didn't they choose the same path. The allegations aren't true. A family dispute was behind this death.""Asha said Ganesh had gone to the fields early morning as usual, raising no suspicion. He took pesticide and died on the way to Haripal hospital. Police have registered a case of unnatural death case and sent the body for autopsy."

As a group, vegetables were 45.81% cheaper during the week.There is, however, little respite when it comes to protein-rich items with double-digit inflation seen in case of fruits (10%), milk (11.5%) and eggs and meat (around 20%). In case of pulses too inflation was estimated at over 14%.Although food inflation has stayed negative, there are signs of acceleration. Economists expect it to be back in the 6-6.5% range by the end of March once the impact of base effect wears off.""Available data regarding sowing trends for the rabi (winter) season indicates a shortfall in the area sown under pulses and oilseeds, which may result in a further increase in the price levels in the coming weeks,"" added Aditi Nayar, economist at ratings agency ICRA.Apart from housewives, food inflation has provided tremendous comfort to policymakers who have been under pressure due to inflation remaining above 9%. With food prices cooling down, overall inflation based on the wholesale price index too eased to 7.47% in December, a two-year low.Just yesterday, the World Bank said that with crop production staying comfortable, inflationary pressures would wear off.But the Reserve Bank of India is expected to attach more importance to non-food segments - manufactured products and fuel and power - when it reviews the monetary policy next week. With industrial production too rebounding, chances are RBI will wait until March to start lowering policy rates."

It was above 16 per cent in the corresponding week of 2011.According to the official data released on Thursday, onion prices were lower steeply by 75.42 per cent year-on-year during the week under review, while potato prices were down by 23.84 per cent. Prices of wheat also fell by 3.57 per cent.Overall, vegetables were 45.81 per cent cheaper during the week under review than in the same period last year.Other food products, led by protein-based items, became more expensive on an annual basis.Pulses prices were 14.27 per cent higher during the week under review, while milk grew dearer by 11.48 per cent. Egg, meat and fish prices were up 19.64 per cent year-on-year.Fruits also became 10.03 per cent more expensive on an annual basis, while cereal prices were up 2.26 per cent.Inflation in the overall primary articles category stood at 2.47 per cent during the week ended January 7, 2012 against 0.51 per cent in the previous week. Primary articles have over 20 per cent weight in the wholesale price index.Experts feel that the decline in food inflation, along with moderation in headline inflation during December 2011, will be a major incentive for the Reserve Bank to look at the option of cuts in key interest rates in the near future."

This was an instant analysis of Jaidev, a PCO owner.Sitting at his PCO on Ambala Road, Jaidev is a first-time voter. But his understanding of political issues is remarkable. ""Bhai sahab, yahan Anna ko koi na pooch raha,"" (Nobody is bothered about Anna factor here),"" says the 20-year-old. Things were no different in the adjoining Muzaffarnagar distruct. ""Bhai thoda bahut suna aur padha hai Anna ke baare mein, "" (We know a few things about Anna and his tirade),"" says Iqbal Singh, who owns a small tea-stall, bang opposite the main entrance of Darul Uloom Deoband -- the world renowned Islamic seminary.Despite a sizable Muslim population, the impact of the Congress's announcement of 4.5% sub-quota to minorities hasn't cut much ice either. ""Here, majority of people are selfemployed, so quota is hardly on their mind,"" says Brijlal, adding: ""It's sugarcane yield that keeps occupying their mind round the year.""Like most of the heartland, people are more bothered about everyday things. A dismal power scenario is one of them. Although everybody feels the pinch of power shortage, it's the cane grower who is hit the hardest. Right from sowing to harvesting, nothing can move without power. And it's in short supply. Barring probably Noida, no other district gets more than 12-14 hours of power. So, cane growers have to make most of the availability, even during ungodly hours post-midnight. Even during the harvest season, there is no respite. Governments of different colours have come and gone but there is no special provision for electricity to the region which is the sugar bowl of the country.Another common and serious complaint of the farmers was the rampant black-marketing of subsidzed fertilizers. While the government outlets, which are supposed to provide a bag of fertilizers for Rs 600, never have their stocks in place, the same bag can be bought for anything between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,500 in the black market.Deepak Guptara of UP Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA) says that even a little help on these counts could change the destiny of the cane-growers. ""Despite such pathetic conditions, the per hectare yield in UP is among the best in the country,"" he said. ""Proper power supply, adequate subsidized fertilizers and improved roads can change the life of the entire belt in not more than two harvests,"" Guptara told TOI.Instead of making policies which could bring some respite for us, different governments in the state as well as the centre have added to our problems, says Manjit Singh, a cane-grower, adding ""they strike a deal with the sugar mill owners and announce minimum support price (MSP) to suit the sugar them."" Although the Mayawati government has raised the minimum support price to the range of Rs 240, growers say that it is not adequate if one considers the rising input cost.The paddy growers, too, complain of extremely low government purchase (20% of the total produce, at best). In Farrukhabad, potato-growers were pushed to a point when they dumped truck loads of potatoes outside the wholesale markets and went home as their prices dipped so low that transporting them back would have cost them more.

Reason: Despite facing common problems across UP, these farmers are divided into caste and communal lines when it comes to voting. Only a small percentage of cultivators vote as 'farmer community'.""It's an irony that farmers have not been able to put a joint front to make their presence felt in the political arena,"" said farmer leader VM Singh who was one of the party in the case and argued in the Supreme Court in favour of farmers. But nevertheless, he said, the decision of the court has shown that there is justice in the country. Otherwise, he added, all the parties when in power have been indifferent towards the problems of the farmers. If farmers start thinking and voting as 'community' there would be no farmer suicide and no need of packages as elected governments would think about farmer interests before taking any decision, he said.Farmers leaders pointed out that government do make announcements and promises but they rarely reach the ground level. As a result, farmers suffer huge losses, commit suicides and are forced to take to streets, block railway tracks and stage road jams in Delhi for their demands. And, they said, when situation goes out of control, the measures like farm loan waivers, free electricity and irrigation etc are announced, which adds to the burden on state exchequer. They also argued that if the state and Central governments start delivering and schemes are implemented effectively at ground level, there would be no suicides and thus no need for populist measures.""This can happen only when farmers become a vote bank. But what we see that they are also swayed by the caste and communal appeals of the political parties. In fact, politicians resort to castism and communalism only when they fail to deliver,"" said Sudhir Panwar, president Kisan Jagriti Manch, while recalling that after Chaudhary Chanran Singh, who mobilized farmers as a community, no other leader in UP has been able to that. He said that the impact of farmers is only limited to floating votes in a particular area where some vote on the basis of local problems such as losses due to lack of storage facility, poor procurement and low prices.Expressing similar views, Rakesh Tikait, secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union said that had farmers voted collectively in elections, the crisis they are facing today would not have arise. ""Imagine after six years of legal battle, now farmers have got judgment in their favour. Since the money involved in the case related to cane dues was huge, some big farmers pursued it till Supreme Court, which is impossible for a small farmer facing losses due to rotting of potatoes due to lack of storage, payment of produce in mandis below the minimum support prices, black-marketing of seeds and fertilizers, increase in fuel prices and irrigation facilities."
33,It's problem of plenty for Bengal potato growers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Its-problem-of-plenty-for-Bengal-potato-growers/articleshow/11560185.cms,2012-01-20,The Times Of India,"BURDWAN/HOOGHLY: Not a crop failure, it's a bumper produce that is dogging the potato growers of Bengal.And the story of their plight remains largely untold while the opposition and the government fight over the farmer deaths across south Bengal. The farmers - who fail to get enough price even after a bumper harvest - remain in the dark themselves, forgotten by the powers that be.Two potato farmers in Burdwan ended their lives in the past two weeks. It's said that it was the bumper crop that forced them to take the extreme step. Because of a bumper crop, there now is a huge gap between the actual price and what the farmers should have got for their produce.Here is a story of two farmers from Shaktigarh, Burdwan. Seikh Sukur Ali and his brother Seikh Ali Hussein had cultivated potato on nine bighas. They also cultivated potato for PepsiCo on a much smaller plot of 9 acres under contract farming. PepsiCo will buy their produce at Rs 275 per bag of 50 kg. But they are not getting Rs 135 a bag for the Pokhraj variety they grew on their 9-bigha land. But then this is just half of the story.""And the A-1, Jyoti and Chandramukhi varieties will be reaped in the last week of February or the first week of March,"" Seikh Sukur Ali says. He has already taken an Rs 70,000 loan from SBI for cultivating potato, which needs to be repaid. He took the loan for he couldn't sell 460 bags of paddy of the past season.West Bengal Cold Storage Association vice-president Patit Paban De said, ""Even as the government's yearend deadline got over, there are nearly one lakh tonne of potato lying unsold in 405 cold storages across the state. The cold storages need to be cleared now for the new crop. Farmers are now selling the crop for whatever price they get. For a 50-kg bag they are getting not more than Rs 100 even if it's sold in Orissa; where the cost and transportation prices make it nearly Rs 175 of a 50 kilogram packet.""Susanta Saha (24) cuts a desolate figure in Memari's Rajpur'. His father Amiya Saha had committed suicide. The first thing Sushanta says is that he would never return back to the field - a graduate, he works in a private firm in Malda and would continue with it. ""My father committed suicide due to debt in market. We have failed to sell the paddy of last season but still cultivated potato on 8 bighas of land. The crop is still in the field and will be reaped on March, but due to poor market price he chose to end his life in frustration. The state government instead of helping us is claiming that he was a heart patient and committed suicide as he could not bear the treatment of heart ailment. I have to sell the crop in the market to get relief on his bank loan and return back to my workplace,"" Sushanta says. His uncle, Ashok Saha alleges, ""The local MLA has never been to our home, how they would know why he ended his life for."" The anger is evident which the opposition is fanning.West Midnapore, Bankura, Burdwan and Hooghly account for almost the entire potato produce - Hooghly with 27 lakh metric tonne potato last year topped the charts. The problem isn't that acute Hooghly's 137 cold storages, like in the other districts. The same pictures greet one in Bankura. Asit Das, a Baital villager, is yet to put a figure to his actual loses - the second year in a row. Meghraj Bhadra, a Kotulpur resident who works in his field and also trades potatoes, says he'd cultivated in 10 bigha of land. ""The initial harvest is unsold; I really don't know what I will do with the new crop.""Chittaranjan Banerjee, Director, Burdwan Central Cooperative Bank said that the government deadline to clear out the cold storage stocks is leading to distress sales of potato in 105 cold storages (in Burdwan) at Rs 70 per 50 kg packet, which means a mere Rs.1.30 per kilogram. Potatoes are sold in the retail market at nothing less than Rs 10 per kilogram even to this day. Banerjee explaining the distress says of the Rs 76 crore disbursed last year to potato cultivators, only 2 per cent has been recovered. This year, another Rs 80 crore has been disbursed. For an average farmer in Bengal - heavily dependent on Boro and Rabi cultivation - a poor price for paddy first, followed by an even worse price for potatoes has left them reeling.Would Bengal then continue to suffer after a bumper harvest? Both Banerjee and De feel that the solution lays partly in government playing a more active role to export potatoes to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Arab counties, where local consumption is more than they produce. The farmers also need to opt for alternative farming of mustard, cereals and wheat - which the state imports from outside. A Minimum Support Price (MSP) can also stop farmers being victimized by unscrupulous agents. The farmers also should also consider using organic fertilizers as the cost of chemical fertilizers is very high.Potato production in Bengal:2009 - 65 lakh metric tonne2010 - 92 lakh metric tonne2011 - 95 lakh metric tonneThe state's own consumption - 50 lakh metric tonneA third of the country's potato is produced in Bengal.The potato being produced now is the Pokraj variety, extremely perishable and can't be kept in cold storages for long.The other varieties, A1, Jyoti and Chandramukhi, are expected to hit the market by February-end. This can be stored in cold storages for even 36-weeks.Cold storages need to be vacated to accommodate the fresh potato stock; only 137 cold storages in Hooghly have managed to do that.In 405 cold storages, one lakh metric tonne potatoes are unsold.What is the problem now?Production in other major potato growing states UP and Punjab - which gets through by mid October - has been exceptionally good this year on the back of favorable weatherBengal's traditional potato export markets of Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, have been flooded by produce from Punjab and UP. Lesser transportation costs make import from these states cheaper than Bengal.Such stiff is the competition that Punjab has already exported 40,000 quintal of fresh potatoes to even Bengal.Farmers and traders - who were holding on to their stock in anticipation of fetching better prices - are now going in for distress selling.The result: take for example the Orissa market. Rs 100 per 50 kg packet are the price being offered to farmers; they need to sell this at least 175 per 50 kg packet to recover the money invested.What is the state government doing?The state had extended the deadline for storage of potato till December 15 - has further extended it till December 31 - in order to help release the entire quantity of produce.The state government has sanctioned Rs 400 crore to consumer cooperatives under Confed, Benfed and ECSC last year to purchase potatoes. This, however, remained mired in allegations that the potatoes were never purchased from farmers. The amount purchased, however, was just a drop in the ocean."
34,12th farmer suicide in rice bowl,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/12th-farmer-suicide-in-rice-bowl/articleshow/11561954.cms,2012-01-20,The Times Of India,"BURDWAN: The curse of huge debts brought upon Bengal's rice bowl by falling paddy and potato prices claimed yet another victim on Thursday when a farmer committed suicide in Burdwan, taking the number of farmer deaths in the district to 12 and the total number across the state to 23 since last October. The crisis is likely to aggravate in March when the potato crop is reaped.But even as price woes and a potato crop damaged by unseasonal rains wreak havoc on the farming sector, chief minister Mamata Banerjee isn't ready to buy the logic that farmers are committing suicide because they aren't getting value for their produce. ""Not a single farmer died due to it. The deaths of 12 persons were due to personal problems with their personal debts running into crores,"" the chief minister said on Thursday. Drawing a contrast with farmer deaths during the Left rule, she pointed out a total of 199 farmers committed suicide in 2008-09 while the toll in 2009-10 was 179.But the father of 35-year-old Sushanta Ghosh, who drank pesticide on Wednesday night and passed away at Burdwan Medical College Hospital in the wee hours of Thursday , had a different story to tell. Sushanta, a farmer at Hetti village in Burdwan's Galsi, was the sole bread-earner in his six-member family  wife, two sons and parents. It wasn't hunger that killed him but the bales of unsold paddy piled up outside his home.The family of Sushanta Ghosh, the farmer who committed suicide at Galsi in Burdwan on Thursday, has bales of paddy piled up at their home. His father Bikash could not sell the paddy because of the low market price. ""My son made a distress sale of some of the produce, but the money was not enough to go for the potato cultivation. He had a loan burden of Rs 2 lakh, of which he owed Rs 60,000 to the local SBI branch, another Rs 35,000 to the local cooperative bank and the remaining Rs 1.05 lakh he borrowed from a local mahajan at high interest rate. The debt burden kept piling up as he didn't get the right price for paddy, potato and mustard ,"" Bikash said.The anxiety didn't build up in a day. Sushanta cultivated the aman paddy and then boro on his own 7-bigha land, and tilled another eight bighas last year. But the yield didn't fetch the price to meet the loan amount. He borrowed again to cultivate potato on a much smaller 7-cottah plot and grew mustard on 5 cottahs. ""But the untimely rain damaged the potato and mustard plants,"" Bikash said.Cousin Debnarayan Ghosh pointed out that Sushanta tried to clear a portion of his debt by selling part of the paddy stocks at Rs 500 a quintal. ""He was depressed . There is no other problem in the family other than the rising debt burden. I beg to the state government to write off his loan and compensate the family,"" he said.Galsi Block II BDO Barsharani Basu sent two officers to Sushanta's village to find out the reason behind the suicide. ""I am waiting for a detailed report from the officers before I comment on the cause of death,"" he said. Incidentally, the Galsi is the largest rice producing block in the country.Local Trinamool leader Prasanta Kundu claimed that Sushanta was more into trading than farming. ""He suffered due to callous potato trading. It has nothing to do with farming,"" Kundu said. Another Trinamool leader Basanta Chowdhury said: ""Sushanta was a potato trader. He was upset because somebody borrowed Rs 25,000 from him and didn't repay it when he needed the money most.""CPM's Galsi zonal secretary Faiaz Rahman said he knew Sushanta personally. ""He took loans from the SBI and the local cooperative, but could not afford to take further loans during rabi cultivation. There has been 12 such deaths in Burdwan district so far,"" Rahman said.Taking feedbacks through party channel, the CM said: ""Do not teach me anything on this. Why are they angry? Is it because my government has stopped paying in cash? The cadres now are unable to give a 50% cut to their party and keep the rest with them. The comrades have stopped earning,"" the CM said.Mamata took her attack a notch further when she held a ""Burdwan group"" which she named, ""Dhan Kore Khoaya Committee"" of receiving kickbacks over rice procurement from farmers.Leader of the opposition Surjya Kanta Mishra said: ""We've repeatedly provided the details of 23 farmers who've committed suicide. I will visit some of these families, the government can also inquire. Do all panchayats have banks?"" On the corruption allegations, he said, ""She has ordered inquiry into a 40-year-old case, why isn't she investigating this?""With an eye on the panchayat polls, Mamata said, ""350 cold storage's will be build. Efforts are on to export potato to Indonasia. Funds to the beneficiary of 100-day work scheme would be paid on a daily basis, instead of the three-week period ."" Mishra said, ""There are enough cold storages in the state. And why Indonesia? She can as well sell these potatoes to the Kolkata market."""

More so, when the current drop is largely owing to the effect of a high base as WPI food inflation in the like week last year was way higher at over 16 per cent.As per the official data, while onion prices slumped by as much as 75.42 per cent year-on-year, potatoes also turned cheaper by 23.84 per cent."

Other things include making a law at the state level to keep waqf property away from acquisition, another on welfare and development of dargahs (mausoleums), special budgetary provisions for technical education in madrasas and inclusion of at least one member of the Muslim community in all commissions, boards and committees of the state government.It promises waiving interest and penalty on outstanding power bills for industries like handloom, carpet, glass and bangles and their likes apart from free power supply to weavers. With the spotlight on farmers, the SP promises to constitute a commission within three months of government formation to device a formula to compute minimum support price of agricultural produce where 50% of the cost of production will be included as minimum profit for the farmers.The manifesto also promises steps to boost import of potato and garlic, free irrigation, ban on sale of mortgaged land by money lenders in case of default in repayment to Rs 5 lakh as compensation in case of death while performing farming-related tasks. With special focus on issues which the Congress Party had either failed to address, the manifesto promises a new law for land acquisition which restricts the state government from playing any role in taking over the farmers' land for any private tie-up.Instead, the party concerned will have to deal the issue with the landowners directly. In case government acquires the land, the project should take off within three years of transfer of possession of land, otherwise farmers will automatically become the owner of the land once again, the manifesto says.Focusing on the youth, the party also promises restoration of student union elections and unemployment allowance of Rs12,000 per annum for all the jobless youth over 35. This apart, fixing the permissible age limit for all government jobs at 35 years and reintroduction of Kanya Vidya Dhan, a scholarship for girls which the party started in its previous tenure, are other highlights of the manifesto.In its fight against corruption, the party promises to not only strengthen the Lok Ayukta but also make it a multi-member bench instead of a one-man post.

39,"Unemployment, a hell no poll can change ",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120124/jsp/northeast/story_15040374.jsp,2012-01-24,Telegraph,"Vicious cycle Imphal, Jan. 23: Md Firoz, a graduate from Lilong of Thoubal district, stands every day at Maharani bridge in the heart of Imphal, waiting for someone who can give him any kind of odd job  from moving sand or earth or cleaning blackened utensils used in a community feast. Firoz, 34, returns home with Rs 150, just enough to feed his wife, ailing mother and four children on a lucky day. However, he is not always lucky. More than half the days in a month he returns home empty-handed. He desperately wants a regular job, wants to send his children to a good school and live a happy married life. The January 28 election has got him some more odd jobs than his usual working days. He works here and there, clearing compounds of candidates or cleaning pots after election feasts. But his worries return when asked about his fate after the election. I dont see any change. This (election) is a routine affair. For poor people like us whether there is election or no election we will die standing here looking for work, he said, looking at a passing scooter. Laishram Ratan, 50, a rickshawpuller from Imphal East, added, Sir, if you think the election will bring any change in our life, then you are wrong. We will get a few hundred rupees, some free meals and a dinner or some charcoal. That is all. Whether the next government is Congress-led or not they are all birds of the same feathers. They will try to get back the crores they have invested once elected and become ministers, Ratan said. For daily wage earners, manual labourers, rickshawpullers, vegetable vendors or hawkers the election is a festival, a few free lunches and getting a few hundred rupees. For them all parties are the same after they come to power. They have lost faith in the system. They consider elections an investment for good returns. Muktarei Devi, 55, from Moirang in Bishnupur district, sells fresh and dry fish on the outskirts of Imphal city. My eldest son got an MBA degree from Bangalore. He applied for a police sub-inspectors post. They wanted lakhs. How can I pay this hefty sum? I have never seen so much money. My son is preparing to apply for another government job. But I believe the next government will make the same demand, she said. People like Firoz, Ratan and Muktarei want a corruption-free society where only the talented and the best can get responsible government jobs. They also want jobs for those who are not fortunate enough to get jobs in the private sector with a salary they can feed their families. They want affordable prices of essential commodities. Manipur is yet to recover from last years 120-day economic blockade. Being a jobless parent is a curse. But bandh and blockades are hell for us. With a days earning of Rs 75 to Rs 100 how can you buy a kg of potatoes at Rs 35 and onion at Rs 40? In addition to this, a days bandh robs me of my daily earnings. Can the next government prevent bandhs and blockades? I dont think so, another woman vendor said. They also want good government schools where their children can get quality education so that they can save some money for their children. Private schools are mushrooming in Manipur, which charges exorbitant fees, as almost all the government schools are dying. We have one government high school in my place. Last year, it could not produce a single successful candidate in the matriculate examinations. Who will send children to such a school? Mongjam Atul, a grade III employee from Imphal West, said."

Photo: S. S. Kumar: Prices of many vegetables have dropped by as much as 30 per cent compared to the rates last month in the Koyambedu market. The change, which is bound to bring cheer to households, has been made possible in view of more arrivals, which traders at the market attribute to the bountiful rainfall.Tomatoes, which come from Krishnagiri and Andhra Pradesh, are sold anywhere between Rs.8 and Rs.10 per kg at the market. Ten days ago, the cost was Rs.15 per kg. Onions from Bellary in Karnataka are priced at Rs.8 a kg. A retail trader in Koyambedu said onions from Maharashtra cost Rs.13 a kg.On Wednesday, D.Abirami, a resident of Ayanavaram, said: I bought twice the quantity of beans, onions, tomatoes and potatoes when I shopped for vegetables. Many of them were priced below Rs.20 a kg. I am also purchasing lot of seasonal vegetables as they have turned cheaper.Green peas, usually sold for Rs.80-100 a kg, were priced at Rs.25. Cabbage and cauliflowers were also priced around Rs.10 a kg. Many customers like Vimala Jayapal of Tiruvottiyur, however, felt that some of the frequently used vegetables such as brinjal and ladies fingers continued to remain out of reach, priced around Rs.50 a kg.V.R.Soundararajan, a wholesale trader, said: We expect the prices to dip further as the market is receiving nearly 50 more lorries than the usual 350 lorries daily. Some of the locally grown vegetables such as brinjals, drumsticks and ladies fingers were expensive in view of the damage to produce in the Thane cyclone.S.Srinivasan, president of Chennai Fruit Commission Agents Association, said that the market would start receiving oranges from Maharashtra in February. Fewer arrivals of apples from Himachal Pradesh also led to increase in the cost.While apples cost Rs.150 per kg, oranges are priced nearly Rs.40 a kg. Pomegranates cost Rs.80 a kg. There has been a sharp rise in the cost owing to escalating transportation charges.I have to pay Rs.32,000 for a lorry trip from Maharashtra now.

However, statistically, much of the decline in the price spiral was owing to the effect of a high base as food inflation during the like week in January 2011 was at a high of over 17 per cent.Ostensibly, it is on account of the high base effect that food inflation is expected to remain in negative zone for some more time during the current fiscal and contribute to the anticipated decline in headline inflation to 7 per cent by the end of March. Once the base effect impact on the inflation data wears off some time by the end of February, food inflation is likely to bounce back to positive territory.However, such seven-day comparisons in food inflation will soon not be feasible any more as the government has decided to do away with the practice of releasing weekly WPI data on primary food articles and fuel as the numbers were not presenting a holistic picture of the price scenario. With the Union Cabinet opting for a switch to the earlier system, the government will continue to release only a monthly WPI headline inflation data containing the break-up for all segments of goods, including food and non-food articles, fuel and manufactured items.The change, however, is in keeping with global norms. Doing away with the weekly inflation data would mean that the volatility associated with week-on-week variations would cease to cause concern. Globally also, it is the norm to give inflation numbers on a monthly basis, Crisil's chief economist D. K. Joshi said.Especially owing to a drop in food prices, headline inflation in December slipped from near double-digit levels during the major part of 2011 to a two-year low of 7.47 per cent in December.As per the weekly data, the maximum fall was in the prices of onions by 79.10 per cent year-on-year, followed by potatoes which turned cheaper by 22.46 per cent even as the decline in prices of vegetables overall was to the extent of 47.06 per cent.Wheat prices were also down 3.37 per cent.

Milk prices also remained firm rising 12.25% year-on-year while fruits prices rose an annual 5.17%.Policymakers say the sharp increase in demand for protein-based items due to large disposable incomes have led to firm prices for these items.

Experts say the weekly numbers are volatile which sometimes leads to panic reaction.The index for food articles group rose by 0.3% to 191.4 from 190.9 for the previous week due to higher prices of bajra (4%), fish-marine and jowar (3% each), ragi and barley (2% each) and wheat, maize and milk (1% each).The Reserve Bank of India in its latest monetary policy review has cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points and has indicated that it may lower rates depending on how the inflation situation pans out.

But the appetisers, reflecting the theme of the event, were an international mishmash: thumb-sized potato pancakes with sour cream and caviar, steaming Chinese dumplings, Indian samosas and Turkish kebabs.The party was in honour of the Goldman thinker who had served notice to the Western investment community a decade ago that the world was being transformed by the rise of emerging markets, in particular, the four behemoths that Jim ONeill, then chief economist at Goldman Sachs, dubbed the BRICs: Brazil, Russia, India and China.In a new book that ONeill has published, The Growth Map: Economic Opportunity in the BRICs and Beyond, he argued that the BRIC concept had become the dominant story of our generation and described the next 11 emerging markets that are joining the BRICs. But there is another force that is reshaping the global economy today, and the Goldman executives who toasted ONeill are a reflection of that: the rise, in the developed Western economies, of the 1 per cent and the creation of what many are calling a new gilded age.In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the opening of the American frontier created the Gilded Age and the robber barons who ruled it. Today, as the world economy is being reshaped by the technology revolution and globalisation, the resulting economic transformation is creating a new gilded age and a new plutocracy.The two forces are intricately related. Indeed we are living through slightly different gilded ages that are unfolding simultaneously. The West is experiencing a second gilded age, while the emerging markets, as ONeill and others have documented, are experiencing their first gilded age. The resulting economic transformation is even more dramatic than that in the Gilded Age. Now, billions of people are taking part across much of the globe, not just the inhabitants of the West.It is structurally much more extreme now in multiple dimensions, said Nobel-winning economist Michael Spence. Now that the emerging economies are pretty big, this is just a harder problem. It is so different from previous economic change that I think these are issues that we have never wrestled with before.In the 200 years from the British Industrial Revolution to World War II there were asymmetries in the world economy, but the entire world wasnt industrialising and it wasnt interacting in the same way, Spence said. These are complex phenomena, he added, and we should approach them with humility. The gilded age of the emerging markets is the easier to understand. China, India and parts of Latin America and Africa are industrialising and urbanising, just as the West did in the 19th century, and with the added oomph of the technology revolution and a globalised economy.The countries of the former Soviet Union are not industrialising  Stalin accomplished that  but they have been replacing the failed central planning systems that coordinated their creaky economies with a market system, and many are enjoying a rise in their standard of living as a result. The people at the very top of all of the emerging economies are benefiting most, but the transition is also pulling tens of millions of people into the middle class and lifting hundreds of millions out of absolute poverty.The collapse of communism is more than a footnote to the double gilded ages of today Economic historians are still debating the connection between the rise of Western democracy and the Gilded Age. But there can be no question that the gilded ages of today are as much the product of a political revolution  the collapse of communism and the triumph of the liberal idea around the world  as they are of new technology.For emerging markets, going through their first gilded age while the West goes through its second one makes things both harder and easier. One reason it is easier is that there is a path to follow, and we know that for all the wrenching convulsions along the way, it has a happy ending. The industrial revolution hugely improved the lives of everyone in the West and opened the vast gap in the standards of living between East and West that still persists today.There were no such models at the time of the Gilded Age  remember that it was the dark satanic mills of the Industrial Revolution that eventually inspired the revolt against capitalism and the bloody construction, by those revolutionaries who succeeded, of an economic and political alternative. But today, the evidence that capitalism works is clear, and not only in the wreckage of the communist experiment.The combined power of globalisation and the technology revolution have also turbocharged the economic transformation of the emerging markets, which is why ONeills BRICs thesis has been so powerfully borne out. We are seeing much more rapid growth in developing countries, especially China and India, because the policies and technologies in the West have allowed a lot of medium-skilled jobs to be done in those countries, said Daron Acemoglu, professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a native of Turkey, one of ONeills Next 11.They are able to punch above their weight because technology allows us to better arbitrage differences in the world economy.This means, Acemoglu argued, that the gilded age of the developing world is proceeding much faster than it did in the West in the 19th century. In the 1950s, labour was cheap in India, but no one could use that labour effectively in the rest of the world, he said. So they could only grow going through the same stages the West had done. Now the situation is different. China can grow much faster because Chinese workers are much better integrated into the, world economy.To be sure, the gilded age in the developing world has its Strains and conflicts. Now that television and the Internet can bring to vivid life the economic gap between a factory worker in, say, Brazil, and the things the middle class takes for granted in the West, even economic growth of 5 per cent or so might feel too slow. That will be especially true when the rich in developing countries live a life of 21st-century plutocratic splendor, including perks like a private jet or heart bypass surgery that would have dazzled a Rockefeller or a Carnegie.Just as the machine age transformed an economy of farm labourers and artisans into one of combine-harvesters and assembly lines, so the technology revolution in the West is replacing blue-collar factory workers with robots and white-collar clerks with computers. At the same time, the West is also participating in the gilded age of the emerging markets.Those who own companies in Dallas or Dusseldorf now employ many of the urbanising peasants of the emerging markets. That is good news for the plutocrats in the West, who can reap the benefits of simultaneously being 19th-century robber barons and 21st-century technology tycoons. But it makes the transition even harsher for the Western middle class, which is being buffeted by two gilded ages at the same time.A survey of about 10,000 Harvard Business School alumni released last week illustrated this gap. The respondents were very worried about US competitiveness in the world economy  71 per cent expect it to decline over the next three years. But this broad concern looks very different when you ask how workers will fare in the transforming global economy, and how companies will do: nearly two-thirds of the Harvard Business School grads thought companies would be less able to pay high wages and benefits, while less than half worried that American corporations would be less able to succeed.When a company is stressed and has issues, it has a much greater set of options than a US worker does, said Michael Porter, the professor who led the study. For the Western middle class, the options are more limited. It is easy to say, get more education, but if you are 40 or 50, it is hard to do, said John van Reenan, head of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. In the last 15 years, it is the middle classes who have suffered.VarriRfienan, who is teaching at Stanford Business School in California this month, said these tensions had been building for years, but had been exacerbated by the financial crisis. That, he said, has brought a wave of populist protest, including the Tea Party on the right and the Occupy movement. These two gilded ages are speeding each other up. Indias gilded age is going to be a combination of Americas first gilded age and the second gilded age, Ashutosh Varshney, a professor of political science at Brown University in Rhode Island, said at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai in November.India is going through this phenomenon in the 21st century, while the pace at which information traveled in the 19th century was very different, said Varshney, who was born in India and spends half of his time in Bangalore. Today, 800 million Indians are connected through mobile phones. The two gilded ages can also get in each others way: As good an explanation as any for the 2008 financial crisis is that it is the result of the collision between a gilded age in China and one in the West. The financial imbalances that are an essential part of Chinas export-driven growth model played a role in inflating the credit bubble that burst with such devastating consequences in 2008.The two gilded ages have a lot in common, and they are reinforcing one another. But both transformations are creating intense political and social pressures, partly because change is always hard, and partly because the rewards of this sort of convulsive shift are so unequal. Moreover, this time around, the whole world no longer has the escape valve which, at least for a time, released some of the pressures of the Industrial Revolution: Europes huddled masses could emigrate to the New World. Even with that option, it is worth remembering, the conflicts and inequities created by industrialisation and urbanisation were ultimately resolved in the West only after a half century of revolution and war.It depends on your time horizon, Van Reenan said. After all, the Great Depression and World War II were a massive cost to humanity. Eventually, humanity will prosper. Capitalism does work, but over the medium term, 30 or 40 years, there could be incredible dislocations.Reuters"
51,Rain lays vegetable crops to waste,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rain-lays-vegetable-crops-to-waste/article2626122.ece,2012-01-30,The Hindu,"Vegetables cultivated in hundreds of acres of land in Vattavada, known as the vegetable bowl of Kerala, were destroyed after incessant rain last week resulted in water-logging of the fields, especially in the low-lying areas.Large-scale lossThe main crops that face decay are carrot, cabbage, potato and beans items. In some fields, farmers have abandoned the crops and bundles of decayed carrots and cabbage were seen lying on the roadsides. Large-scale crop decay was reported in areas like Chilanthiyar and Pazhamthottam as well.The farmers in Vattavada depend on vegetable cultivation to eke out a living. A greater area had recently been brought under cultivation due to the intervention of the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, Keralam (VFPCK). The Kudumbasree units here had formed joint liability groups and brought over 50 acres of fallow land under cultivation.VFPCK district manager Bindu Chandran told The Hindu on Sunday that the worst affected crops were beetroot and cabbage.They had almost ripened but due to the incessant rain last week, the farmers could not begin the harvest, she said.Farmer exploitationVattavada had been in the news following reports of the exploitation of the farmers by businessmen from Tamil Nadu, who pay in advance for the crops and collect them when harvested at a nominal price fixed by them. Though VFPCK had opened Karshaka Swayasraya Vipani at Vattavada, only a fraction of the total production gets there as many farmers seek advance payment from businessmen at the time of sowing.Vattavada panchayat vice-president Mohandas said that an initial estimate showed that carrot in 400 acres, potato in 150 acres, cabbage in 200 acres and various beans varieties in 300 acres had been destroyed.The farmers will be unable to sow in the next season and they should be provided financial assistance, he said. Vegetables sent to the Aluva and Perumbavoor markets were returned due to their poor quality, delivering another blow to the farmers here.No harvest'I have left nearly four acres of crops without harvesting as it will not earn me anything, Muthusawmi, a farmer said. I will be unable to sow in the next season, he said, adding that though there had been no rains for the last four days, the damage had already been done.Thirukumaran, another farmer, said that he had harvested nearly an acre of carrot crop, but it was of no use and the merchants said that even the better quality produce would begin to decay by the time they reached the markets. Bundles of decayed vegetables lying on the roadsides are a proof of the farmers' plight, he said."
52,"Never on the rocks, please…",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Dehati-Aadmi/never-on-the-rocks-please/,2012-01-31,The Times Of India,"Long, long ago, when I was a cadet under training, we were taught about a whole lot of things which had really no relevance to modern shipping as it existed in the 70s. It is another matter altogether that the course syllabus has still not changed and the instructors are still teaching the same old stuff and it has even lesser relevance. In one way, they were correct  change is not inevitable, the oceans behave in almost the same way now as they did for centuries  unpredictably. But some of the subjects taught were relevant in the age of sail clippers carrying opium from Chappra to Canton.Which is another way of saying  see what happened to Chappra as an inland port for ocean-going vessels, while Canton went on to become Guangzhou, which at last count had 4600 berths, 133 buoys and 2359 anchorages, and can bring in ships of 100,000 dwt size at high water. Never mind Chappra, see what happened to Calcutta, where water available for ships is now even less than what it was 3-4 decades ago, and the port is the same size as it was then. Maybe they are waiting for climate change to improve things. Mumbai can try to be Shanghai  but Canton was related to Calcutta even before that. That was another subject we were not taught  real Indian maritime history.One of the subjects taught, though, was signals. We were taught, and are still taught, semaphore and morse. Walkie-talkies have replaced the first, and satellites the second. In both cases, however, rules require that we continue to learn these dinosaur subjects, because nobody knows when the atmosphere may change totally, leaving us with no options but to communicate by flag or lamp.Actually, this climate change has made it even more unpredictable. The Arctic icelands are now known as the Arctic wetlands, and not only ships are now cutting through on what is called a polar route, but also mosquitoes. Yes, that essential component of the Tropics, has landed up inside the Arctic Circle. You will not hear this on television but some day soon maybe a camera-man trying to shoot an anchor and a polar bear will capture a shot of one buzzing around.So anyways, there we were, being trained about navigating ships. And one of the golden rules was that if the amount of water below your ship was less than the depth of water said ship was drawing, also called draft, then you were most certainly aground. This was a lesson learnt with even more ferocity when navigating through the Hooghly River on its way from Calcutta to the Bay of Bengal, because the sand-banks would shift and build up with total disregard for any sort of system or method, and ships which had passed through safely just a couple of tides ago would find themselves ramming into solid sand at a rate of knots the next. Luckily, there are not too many television camera crews or reporters in that part of the country because there are too many mosquitoes, imagine if this happened in South Delhi?Wait for summer. And see what the mosquitoes do to us this year. More climate change. But back to the Hooghly River.To our good fortune, the shifting sand in the Hooghly was also very soft and unstable, so it was usually just a question of running the engines full astern till the ship backed off. And then, proceeding as normal, without too much fuss about things. Dont file any reports was the standard operating procedure. What happens below the water level remains there is true not only in Las Vegas, and minor holes could always be patched up with an amazing technology known as cement box  many ships on those regular runs were more cement box than steel after some time. Once in a while, the ship went to dry docks, all the cement boxes were discarded, and fresh steel welded on, bobs your Uncle.But thats also because there are no rocks in the seabed in that area. What our training drilled into our heads was simple  if the shoreline was rocky, or if there was even the faintest hint that a rocky outcrop preceded landfall, then you simply stayed very far away. This was dinned into our heads to an extent that very few seafarers, if any, will ever drink or order a drink on the rocks. Give us the full bottle instead. Which is probably what the Italian Master did, when the Costa Concordia went on the rocks, he grabbed the bottle.Going aground on the rocks happens, ships go aground, for a variety of reasons. If they happen to be huge Italian luxury liners, then they make the headlines, and rude jokes are made about Italian Captains who at the end of the day were doing what the bean counters ashore told them to do. But in reality, there is a modern technological reason why ships venture too close to land, and it is here where we learn how things are so much more the same all over the world now, and not just mosquitoes.And it is called: hunting for the signal. Have you ever run round in circles at home or in office, looking for that elusive spot where signal strength will prevent the phenomenon called dropped signal, and bumped into something while doing so? Or have you seen how people on airplanes switch their mobile phones on as soon as the aircraft touches down?Thats what is reportedly happening on ships all over the world lately. The most prudent and sensible of navigators can go ballistic when faced with a signal drop on their personal mobile phones. Never mind going aground in congested areas, there is the case of a ship managing to ram straight into the island of Tristan da Cunha, a remote group of well-marked islands in the South Atlantic, because the navigators onboard wanted to desperately catch a better signal, and then performed some improbable navigational tricks which had them farming potatoes with the local population for weeks afterwards.New ships or old, hand signal or satellite, the issues are the same. On sea or ashore."
53,Farmers' kin upset over West Bengal's refusal to acknowledge suicides,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-kin-upset-over-west-bengals-refusal-to-acknowledge-suicides/article2852281.ece,2012-02-02,The Hindu,"Believe me, I am not making any of this up, insists Asim Saha brother of Amiya Saha, who killed himself after consuming a bottle of pesticide a month ago after failing to find buyers for the paddy he had harvested, when he speaks of the events that occurred on the fateful night and the paddy that remains unsold at their home in Rajpur village in the West Bengal's Bardhaman district.The kin of the farmers who have taken their lives (31 incidents have been reported since October 21 in Bardhaman district alone) not only have to reconcile with their loss, but also have to bear with the apathy of the State, which refuses to acknowledge their plight.My brother was overwhelmed with anxiety over the sale of the paddy. Last years potato crop was sold at throwaway prices and the rice mills were refusing to buy the paddy from this season's harvest. But after he died, there were some people who tried to say that he killed himself because he suffered from a kidney disease, said Mr. Saha, without mentioning who the rumour-mongers were.The wife of Bhootnath Pal, a farmer who tilled three bighas (about an acre) of land in Kauri village and hung himself on January 28, pores over all documents from a file that her husband used to maintain  some not even pertaining to the nearly Rs. 9,000 that he owed to a bank in the form of a farm loan.I have nothing to hide, she asserts. When neighbours peep into a silo where grain lies unsold to estimate how much may be inside, she is quick to point out that it is lined with hay at the bottom because she would not like to exaggerate anything.With every incident the Left parties in the Opposition as well as ally Congress is turning the screws on the Trinamool Congress for failing to address the problems of the farmers. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has responded by claiming that it is all propaganda of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and that among all those incidents reported there is only one farmer.At a time like this, the government is not standing by the farmers. When one transport employee committed suicide, the State Government did a turnaround on the announcement of withdrawal of subsidies from the sector. So many farmers have killed themselves, but the government does not care, Mr. Saha said.While district officials have offered temporary relief to the families (150 sacks of Amiya Saha's paddy was sold to rice mills as a part of a special quota and Bhootnath Pal's wife was given Rs. 5,000 from the BDO's office), they maintain that these incidents cannot be counted as farmer suicides.However, they admit that there is an inadequacy of institutional debt in the region and local moneylenders and middlemen continue their hold over farmers in the region. They also rue the lack of information among the farmers about agricultural loans from banks.A mahajan (moneylender) can charge up to five per cent per monthly interest on the sums they give out, which amounts to 60 per cent interest annually. In contrast, farmers can avail loans at seven per cent from banks and if they repay the loan in the first year, the next year's loan will be available at four per cent. But most farmers do not know about these schemes, a district official said.You do not need to ask me about what my problems are. Everyone in the village knows them and are facing the same issues, said the father of 20-year-old Prosenjit Mondal, who hung himself from a tree after a disagreement with his father."

""I can perhaps recover only 50% of my investment. Bank loans are hitting the roof. How long can we live like this?"" asks potato grower Jang Bahadur Singh Sangha.The question aboutsurvival seemsincongruouson Jang Bahadur's lips. By no yardstick arethe Sanghassmallfarmers. With 45,000-50,000 tonnes of potatoesharvested annually from the 5,000 acres leased near Jalandhar, they are probably the country's largest growers of potatoes. Nearly 175 tractors till the Sanghas land. There's a workshop for the machines. The chain is complete with a lab where Cornell University-educated Jang Bahadur, the youngest Sangha, develops seeds and undertakes tissue culture. The produce is stored in his 11 cold storages. So, quite clearly these are no ordinary farmers. Yet, they're in distress.Not just them. Potato growers across states have been hit by a glut resulting from two bumper harvests. A third is on the way, which is likely to pile more pressure on the hapless farmers. From Gujarat to Punjab, from Farrukhabad to Singur, farmers are reeling under the pressure of bumper harvests.""The glut will continue in 2012 since the weather has been ideal for growing potatoes. It would have been even better had there not been so much rain,"" says Jang Bahadur pointing to potatoes that are almost ready to harvest.Like several other farmers, the Sanghas have dumped around 90,000 sacks of potatoes - some thrown away and the rest shipped to Assam and Karnataka for Rs 1-1.50 a kg. ""If you include the cost of the jute bags, we virtually sold it for free. But we didn't have a choice since you can't see it rotting in front of you. In fact, things had become so bad that we requested the district administration for a designated place to dump our harvest,"" says Jang Bahadur, nicknamed India's potato king.Government inflation data shows potato prices, at the all-India level, have fallen over 24% compared to last year.Onions too have fared poorly with wholesale prices declining 79%. In Lasalgaon (Maharashtra), onions are selling for around Rs 3 a kg. This is showing up in retail prices - in Delhi onions are now selling for Rs 16 a kg compared to Rs 80 a year ago.The sharp decline in potato priceswas an election issue in Punjab. In UP, Rahul Gandhi used the glut in potatoes to argue for foreign directinvestmentin retail.Last month, the Congress general secretary told election gatherings across Farrukhabad and Kannauj that FDIwouldsolvethe puzzleof a kilogram of potato fetching Rs2or lessfor thefarmer while a packet of potato chips costs Rs 10. ""A packet of chips is made from just half a potato,"" he had said.Economists and government officials say there has been too much focus on increasing production and little has been done to boost processing and storage. A farm economist says, ""You need the ability to process potatoes. May be powder it and add it to wheat. You need more cold storage facilities, otherwise farmers will be hit as much by a bumper crop as by drought."" One oft-suggested measure is to push for construction of more cold storages. Now, the government is lending a helping hand, offering subsidies. ""So, we've built cold storages. But what will you do with your crop when it is not sold at the right price?"" asks Jang Bahadur.POTATO In mid-January, prices were 22.46% lower than a year ago Compared to March 2011, prices down 14.23% 12.41% dip in a week (Jan 7-14)ONION Onion prices have crashed over 79% in a year Fall of 14.23% since March In a week (Jan 7-14), prices dropped 12.41%"

Months after potato farmers in Deesa destroyed potatoes worth crores, farmers in Saurashtra are doing the same.Onion growers in villages of Mahuva in Bhavnagar, one the highest producers of the vegetable in the state and Talaja in Rajkot are either not harvesting it or are destroying it for fear of not getting enough prices in the market.Pravin Kathiriya, a board member in Mahuva Marketing Yard, said, ""This is the worst ever scenario for onion growers as they are not even able to recover the minimum production cost of their crops. At present, farmers are getting Rs 40 to Rs 60 per 20 kg for red onion and Rs 100 to Rs 120 for white onion.""Mahuva Marketing Yard receives 1 lakh bag (one bag contains 50 kg) onion daily.""Farmers have started destroying crops in the fields and avoiding harvest. They have already spent a lot of money on production. Now, they do not have money to take the onions to the market,"" said Bharatsinh Wala, a farmer in Taredi village of Mahuva taluka.A major chunk of the total red onions produced in this region was consumed in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. ""However, onions from Rajashtan and Maharashtra which are less expensive have made inroads in these regions due to which farmers of Saurashtra have lost ground and are seeing the onions pile up,"" said Pravin Gajera, an onion trader in Mahuva, reasoning the decline in the prices.According to Babubhai Wala, a farmer from Dudhala village in Mahuva, ""on an average farmers spend Rs 40,000 per bigha to produce onions.

While last year the state supplied these tubers to Russia, this time, growers are eyeing Europe as a market. A three-member European Union (EU) food and veterinary office audit team is touring Punjab to examine whether state's potato crop is pest-free.As part of that, the team met principal secretary (agriculture and Markfed). Director (horticulture) Lajwinder Singh Brar told TOI, ""Punjab government had written to Centre about its desire to export potatoes, which the state has in surplus. The government had written to EU and now this team is here.""The potatoes were tested in laboratories of the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) and Central Potato Research Institute, Jalandhar. The team also checked packing centres, cold storage facilities and seed farms in the state and export arrangements at Attari border.Punjab produces 21 lakh tonnes of potatoes on 80,000 hectares. The state has claimed it is pest-free when it comes to tuber crops. It has been seeking market access to EU for past five years.It had claimed that the potatoes here did not have the diseases known as brown rot and ring rot. ""Climate here is such that pests, especially these two (which are prohibited by EU) are not present,"" said Brar.Europe is the world's largest importer and exporter of potatoes. ""We have 4-5 lakh tonnes of surplus potato produce. Farmers are not able to get good prices for the crop and our export experience with Russia has been encouraging,"" said Brar.Around 10,000 tonnes of potatoes were exported to Russia last year from Punjab. A recent bumper crop had led to low prices being offered for potatoes. That had led to protests from farmers who dumped the produce on roads as a mark of protest in December.The EU team's report, which will be routed through Centre, is expected to help ascertain if Punjabi farmers get to see their produce on European dining tables."

Due to attack of blight disease for the last four years, potato growers are facing distress, he said.The Union ministry of agriculture should come to the rescue of potato growers in the state by announcing a special package and also help in establishing a Potato Research Station at Hassan in order to find a permanent solution to the problems faced by these farmers, the letter states.The chief minister has also sought the Centres intervention in procurement of ginger, turmeric and cardamom under minimum support price (MSP) scheme.Special grant soughtThe chief minister has urged Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia to provide a special grant of Rs 430 crore for the overall development of Bidar on the occasion of 500th year of consecration of Guru Nanak Jheera Gurudwara scheduled to be held from April 24 to 29.The chief minister, in a letter to Ahluwalia, has said the Gurudwara of Bidar is considered to be one of the holiest places in the entire nation. The 500th year consecration celebration is likely to attract around 20 lakh people. To provide better facilities to the people on the occasion, a Rs 430 crore project to upgrade infrastructure has been drawn up.Bidar is one of the underdeveloped districts of Karnataka.

58,Veggies from a bag!,http://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/Veggies-from-a-bag/article13380708.ece,2012-02-05,The Hindu,"A chance trip to the Netherlands changed D. Chitra's world view. The managing partner of Asiann Coir Products was invited by a client to see how they were using the coir pith she exported. She saw tulips blooming from a coir pith base and was hooked.At around the same time, she attended a workshop that spoke about the ills of consuming pesticide-laden vegetables and greens. That got her thinking.She started Asiann Organic Easy Grow in 2010. The company sells ready-to-harvest plants in UV-treated polyethylene bags (planters) and helps set up green houses  a covered space to raise plants. The first 18 months were spent on research and development. Then, she started marketing the planters in front of stores such as Nilgiri's (shortly at Spar too) and at Asian Steel Traders on Trichy Road.Soon, word got around. Her company has now set up more than 40 green houses and sold more than 5,000 plants (using certified seeds) in places such as Coimbatore, Chennai, Kancheepuram and Dharmapuri.Chitra focussed on vegetables, greens and flowers. Soon, flowers took the backstage. Few cared about vegetables. But, should that not be our focus, considering we eat them every day? she asks. Sadly, we don't really look into what goes into our daily diet. It's best to eat what we raise ourselves.Chitra's planters hold a mixture of coir pith, sea algae, vermicompost, panchagavya and eco-shield, the leaf extract of plants such as neem, pungai, nochi and aloevera. Since the coir pith retains water, you need to water them only once in five days. The bags, which weigh around nine kg, can be reused for up to three years. She also stocks vertical and horizontal planters, ideal for cramped spaces. The green houses, says Chitra, also serve as an oxygen-rich space where one can relax and feel rejuvenated.Besides more than 15 greens, including palak, pasalai, methi, sirukeerai, thandukeerai and chakravarthi keerai, she also stocks bitter gourd, lettuce (five-odd varieties), beans, carrot, ladies finger, ginger, onion, garlic and brinjal.The company is now working on getting watermelon, strawberry and cucumber to thrive in the planters. Also, following a request from a Maldivian client, they are looking at the feasibility of raising onion, potato and tomato.It's been a learning curve for Chitra too. Learning from the professors at TNAU and those at the JSS College of Pharmacy, Ooty, has been a wonderful experience. How much these plants give us, she says.Renewed interestWhat gladdens her is that people are now showing interest in raising plants. I recently went to National Model Matriculation School and the Government School, Vellalore, to speak to children on organic farming. When I left, I gave them all a container, the coir pith mix and a seed. Today, they are so possessive about the plants they have raised.The company also stocks native herbs that can help with anything from cold and an upset stomach to toothache. There's karpooravalli, lavender, thyme, sage, parsley, sweet marjoram, stevia, wintergreen and more. Before we leave the farm in Peedampalli, Chitra hands out a bright yellow bud of the palvali poondu, said to cure toothache. Bite into it and the mouth tingles furiously.FARMING AND LOVING ITA. Kulandhaivelan, who works in the steel industry, opted for a 200-sq ft greenhouse for his Kuniamuthur home in April. Since then, weve been able to harvest whatever our family needs. I shop only for potato and onion, he says. Hes planted tomato, avaraikai, chilli, beans, greens, brinjal and drumstick. The taste is better. The kids love pottering about in the green house and theres the thrill of consuming something youve produced.S. Elangovan, a professor of management at Bharathiar University, has a similar set-up in his Ganapathy home. He raises varieties of greens and tomatoes. I love plants. They need little maintenance  just an hour twice a week is enough  but I speak to them every day and monitor their progress. Its a relaxing exercise. The oxygen in the green house is an added attraction. He tends to the garden with his fashion-designer daughter-in-law Poonkuzhali.FactfileThe green house costs Rs. 80 a sq ft. A 200-sq ft one can hold 85 planters and costs around Rs. 35,000. The easy grow kit (with seeds, enriched pith, etc) costs Rs. 200 while a ready-to-harvest planter costs Rs. 220. Each plant yields about seven to nine kg of vegetables. For details, call 0422-4349914/24/25, e-mail md@asianncoir.com or visit >http://www.organicgardeningindia.com"

This is almost the same as the price in 2011. Hence, farmers are asked to take up sowing in the Neerbogam (February-March) season.The cell has also suggested that farmers treat seeds with fungicides like Aretan or Agallol and pay attention to pre-harvest care.The forecast was made based on the prevailing price in the Mettupalayam markets for the past 22 years. The arrival of the Nilgiris potato is maximum during June-December. Peak arrival is from August to September in the Mettupalayam market.Tamil Nadu produced nearly 97,200 tonnes of potato from 4,600 hectares in 2010-11 according to National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation. Potato is a major vegetable consumed widely throughout Tamil Nadu. It is grown in the hilly regions of Dindigul, the Nilgiris, Krishnagiri and Erode.For details, contact 0422-2431405; or the research station in Udhugamandalam on 0423-2442170."

Criticising the government for failing on both the sectors,agriculture and industries,he said: The government has taken the state backward in both industry and agriculture  It has not taken a single step towards industrialisation compared to what was done by us. No new industry has come up under the new regime, said the CPM leader while addressing a party rally here.He claimed that industries like JSW steel,Wipro,Infosys and Cognizant had set foot in the state during the Left Front rule,but now investors are realising that this government will not do anything to bring new industry.Bhattacharjee said that although there had been a good harvest of aman paddy this season,the cultivators could not sell the produce because neither the government nor the cooperatives were buying the crops.I recently went to Burdwan. There,the paddy growers are running from pillar to post trying to sell their harvest. Even if they can,they are getting Rs 600 to 700 per quintal,instead of the MSP of Rs 1,100, Bhattacharjee said.He said farmers are also reluctant to go for potato and boro cultivation for fear that they would not be able to sell their produce.Although the erstwhile Left Front government had taken steps to buy jute at Rs 4,000 per quintal,the price now stands at Rs 2,000. Why is this? No one seems to know and no one is doing anything. Ministers are giving differing statements. This has never happened when we were in the government, Bhattacharjee said.On the recent incidents of violence in some colleges in the state,Bhattacharjee alleged that law and order is on the brink of a breakdown under the present government.The CPM leader also found fault with the signing of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) agreement in Darjeeling,initiated by the Mamata Banerjee government,saying it would only boost the demand for Gorkhaland and not bring development of any sort.There is no reason to think that agitators would abandon the demand for Gorkhaland with the signing of the GTA agreement. It will only foment the demand. Darjeeling is sitting on a powder keg. It will erupt any day, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

He grinds a paste of garlic, onion, and a few leaves of coriander that he and his wife, Tulsibai then eat with a roti' leftover from the previous evening.Their small hut at one end of Ganpatkheda hamlet in Bhadesar in Chittorgarh district, Rajasthan, has two pots, and four kilos of wheat flour stacked away in a corner. We manage to eat a vegetable like potato about half the month. The other 15 days we eat rotis with chillies, says Bhil. Working as a hali', or a bonded labourer, and a diet that verges on starvation, has robbed Bhil of his youth. Then, a few years ago, the landlord found that he was too weak to work and turned him away. Today, Bhil ekes out an existence through daily wage work.Tulsibai has also not been spared. She once tended cattle on the farm of the same landlord, but today with arthritis she cannot. Officially, Bhil and his wife do not exist on state records. They have no ration card  or MGNREGA job card.A few huts away live Ratni Bhil and her sister, Nari Bhil. They are fortunate to be young, but their lives too are circumscribed by the fact that their husbands work as bonded labourers and their households, too, are not on the radar of the government's Public Distribution System (PDS). Ratni's family depends on the landlord from whom they borrowed Rs 35,000 five years ago to procure food grains in bulk to keep the household going. My husband works without wages on the farm in lieu of this debt; I work on the same farm three-four days a week. The landlord gives us wheat once every few weeks, she says. Rotis and black tea  milk is not available because the family does not own any cattle  is the staple family diet.Both Ratni and Nari did find some work under the MGNREGA in 2010 but did not get paid for their labour until a few months after the work got over. In the absence of credit and social security, they cannot but depend on the local landlords for loans to tide over expenses incurred during an illness or a wedding.In May 2010, the Rajasthan government began PDS reform  increasing food grains subsidy, delivering grains straight to ration shops to reduce pilferage, and creating a state BPL list' to extend the benefit of ration cards. Despite improvements, groups like these Bhil families working as bonded labourers continue to be left out of social security nets.In the 2007 PDS survey, government collected information on 13 counts. At the end of the survey, they recorded only three families as BPL in Ganpatkheda when at least 25 families are there, says Khemraj of Khetihar Khan Mazdoor Sangathan. We got the district officials to revise the list but some of the poorest families are still out of it.The deaths of 47 Sahariya tribals due to hunger during the 2001 drought had triggered a Public Interest Litigation by the People Union for Civil Liberties in the Supreme Court. That case went on to become the basis for civil society's demand for the right to food. The biggest concern with respect to the draft National Food Security Bill pertains to PDS entitlements. Classifying households into APL-BPL has been a disaster in both 1997 and 2002, half of the poor did not get BPL cards, says Reetika Khera, economist and author of a recent study on PDS. She points out that general and priority households under the proposed Act will boil down to continuing the same categories with new names.(Women's Feature Service)Not only does the practice of bonded labour continue, but often these families do not even exist in government records"
62,Cultivating an interest,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/cultivating-an-interest/story-QTRTjAETj0RZXQYszkNKKJ.html,2012-02-13,Hindustan Times,"Until four years ago, Mustafaganj was like any other Indian village. Its people had big dreams, but they killed them. Manoj Kumar, a gold medalist in geography from BR Ambedkar University of Muzaffarpur, knew what it meant to have unfulfilled desires.Like most young men from Bihar, he wanted join the IAS. But couldnt. In 2006, he returned home after completing his postgraduation, smack in the middle of the Maoist-controlled red zone, to discover people living on the edge. He convinced them to sign up for a club whose members would be engaged in the production of vermi-compost and start organic farming.Day labourer Leela Devi, 43, is a member of Manojs Bihari Thakur Kisan Club. Yeh khad nuksaan nai karta hai (This manure does not harm), she said with a smile on her face. Itll produce nearly six quintals of organic manure and fetch Rs 3000. It funds her childrens education. Leelas son is now a graduate. Her daughter is about to complete B.A.Kumars initiative has clearly begun to energise the local economy. As one winds ones way through his village, hundreds of green makeshift vessels assembled out of synthetic sheets come into view. There is one almost outside every house. Each of those containers, filled to the brim with cow-dung, rotting banana trunks and earthworms, is sealed tight at the mouth. Three months later, they yield six quintals of organic manure worth Rs 3,000. More than 150 women and 300 men of the village are producing this in their bid for self-reliance, and so that their children have a chance at education. Before 2006, the 3,000-strong village had only five graduates and two post-graduates. Today, there are 15 post-graduates, including four women, in Mustafaganj.Initially, Kumar had a tough time convincing farmers to follow his example. With time, he was able to persuade them that organic farming and production of vermi-compost involved no extra expenditure. They started taking interest because the banks and agricultural scientists backed us, he said.His persistence paid off. Nearly 350 farmers are at present organised into a green brigade under the aegis of the Kisan Club that has branches in 10 neighbouring villages. But Kumar hasnt hung up his boots. He continues to move around educating farmers about the latest agricultural techniques and encouraging women to cultivate and become self-reliant. The Club has been registered with NABARD that provides financial help to farmers under its agri-development schemes. More than 150 members now have Kisan Credit Cards; banks are more ready to advance them loans. Under the National Horticulture Mission, the state government has also started providing farmers high-quality seeds and subsidies worth Rs 5,000 each for setting up vermi-compost units.The Club has more than 100 trained farmers, who interact and inform other farmers in several neighbouring villages. It has helped people set up vermi-compost units in Mustafaganj and the surrounding villages. The yield of wheat has, over the past four years, gone up from 60 kg to 100 kg per katha. Maize, wheat, potato and guava yields have also doubled, said Mahesh Kumar, a trainer, who motivates farmers through his songs during the Kisan Club meetings.The Club has also turned womens interest towards organic farming. They have successfully planted mango, lemon and guava using the grafting method. Sushila Devi, a mother of four, is thrilled with the new learning. Do you know there are more than 40 varieties of guava and about a dozen varieties of lemon? We have become experts not only in organic compost but also in grafting method for mango and guava, she said.Villagers of Kumars village, however, rue the absence of a market to sell their produce for a good price. Rajdeo Prasad, a villager, said: We sell high-quality guava for Rs 10-16 per kg here. It sells at double that price in Patna.Despite these concerns, Mustafaganj, other villagers say, has shown the way. It has also checked the migration of villagers to other states. And all because of one man.

63,Jan inflation at 2-year low of 6.55 per cent,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/227071/jan-inflation-2-year-low.html,2012-02-14,Deccan Herald,"New Delhi, Feb 14,2012,DHNS : 21:55 ISTFM sees situation to ease by March-endInflation, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), stood at 7.47 per cent in December 2011. It was 9.47 per cent in January last year.The latest numbers are the lowest since November, 2009 when the inflation was 4.73 per cent.As per the data, food inflation was (-) 0.52 per cent in January against 0.74 per cent in December. Food inflation fell into the negative zone on account of cheaper vegetables, like potato and onion whose prices fell by 23.15 per cent and 75.57 per cent, respectively, on annual basis.The fall in inflation to a two-year low also raised Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjees hope it would stabilise around 6 per cent by March end. He, however, said that inflation at the current level was not acceptable. I now expect that the March-end 2012 inflation will be closer to 6 per cent, Mukherjee told reporters here.Analysts said the fall in inflation raises hope of a decent economic growth and ease in price pressure on common man in coming times.The annual inflation fell on the back of cooling food inflation which moved to -0.52 per cent from 0.74 per cent in December.However, prices of protein-rich food items such as eggs, fish and meat, milk and pulses remained high, suggesting that food inflation remained a potential pressure point.However, prices of manufactured items, which have a weight of around 65 per cent in the WPI basket, continued to be a cause for concern. Manufactured inflation stood at 6.49 per cent year-on-year in January, as against 7.41 per cent in the previous month.Fuel prices rose 14.21 per cent from a year earlier, compared with an annual rise of 14.91 per cent in December.The steady fuel inflation pointed towards political considerations that have forced the government to delay an adjustment in petroleum and coal prices. Policymakers said lowering of inflation also made a case forthe Reserve Bank of India to cut rates.Last month, the RBI signaled readiness to lowering rates if inflation eased further. It has, however, cited risks to inflation from global crude oil prices and the weak rupee, as well as India's growing fiscal deficit. The impact of Europes debt crisis has also added to risks, with a trade deficit expected to rise to $160 billion in 2011-12, threatening renewed pressure on rupee.Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said: I hope that we will be able to keep inflation under control in coming months. Inflation for November 2011 has been revised upwards to 9.46 per cent from provisional estimate of 9.11 per cent."

I don't think there is any problem of food security. Ample production this year can bolster reserves. However, there is every need to improve productivity to sustain food security in the long run, Secretary, Agriculture and Cooperation, Prabeer Kumar Basu, said here on Tuesday while talking to The Hindu .Admitting that there was urgent need to tackle climate change issue as it was having increasing impact on agriculture, Mr. Basu said crop varieties which could withstand the phenomenon were required to be developed. He stated that increase in minimum support price of food crops, pulses and oil seeds over the last six years had a definite impact on their extent of cultivation and production though there was a dip in pulses and oilseeds coverage in recent years.When his attention was drawn to the crop holiday observed by a section of farmers in coastal Andhra due to lack of remunerative price for paddy, It's unfortunate but there were other reasons too.Cold chainsMr. Basu said the Centre had given clearance for setting up national cold chain centre recently for improving cold chain facilities in the country. Under it, the government would train manpower and create awareness and provide funding for public-private efforts to set up cold chains. Against the requirement of 69 million tonnes of cold-storage facility, the country had only 29 MT capacity. A horticulture cold-chain train was being tested between Bhusawal (Maharashtra)-Delhi-Agra and a banana consignment had reached the destination recently without any damage to the fruit load. Such trains could be extended for movement of crops like onion, potato and others, he said.Earlier, he inaugurated a Centre of Excellence in the Directorate of Sorghum Research (DRS) in Rajendranagar for value addition and food processing of millets. Speaking on the occasion, he said promotion of millets, particularly sorghum (jowar), would hold key in ensuring food security."

[I] now expect that the March-end 2012 inflation will be closer to 6 per cent, Mr. Mukherjee said while pointing to concerns over the price trend of other commodities such as edible oils, milk and protein-based items which could stoke inflation yet again.The main worry going forward is on edible oils, milk and some animal proteins which may continue to threaten food inflation, as the required institutional reforms in agricultural marketing and improvement in storage and cold chains will operate with a lag  these are areas where States have to take a lead and take advantage of Central government initiatives  announced in the last two Union budgets, he said.The Finance Minister's worry on this count is not misplaced. The WPI data show that food inflation was in negative zone at (-) 0.52 per cent in January owing to cheaper vegetables such as potatoes and onions, which were down 23.15 per cent and 75.57 per cent, respectively, year-on-year. However, prices of edible oils and milk during the month were up 9.59 per cent and 12.6 per cent, respectively, while that of eggs, meat and fish was still higher by 18.63 per cent on a yearly basis. Moreover, manufactured goods, which account for a weight of about 65 per cent in the WPI basket, continued to cost more. As per the data, inflation in manufactured items stood pegged at 6.49 per cent in January year-on-year, as against 7.41 per cent in the previous month. Inflation in overall primary articles, however, stood lower at 2.25 per cent during the month as compared to 3.07 per cent in December, while in non-food primary articles, it moderated to 0.55 per cent from 1.48 per cent in the previous month. In such a scenario, as to whether the Reserve Bank of India will go ahead with a cut in interest rates during its mid-quarterly review next month remains a question mark."
66,"No respite for potato farmers: after 2 bumper crops,rain damages crop",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/no-respite-for-potato-farmers-after-2-bumper-crops-rain-damages-crop/,2012-02-15,Indian Express,"Its not going to be a good season for the potato farmers in Punjab. The farmers,who dumped their bumper produce on roads in December last year in protest against low rates,are now expecting a fall of more than 25 percent in output of the tuber due to sudden unfavourable weather last month.Rain in the month of January has dealt a severe blow to potato growers in Punjab and it is going to have a damaging effect on overall production of crop in Punjab. We think the crop loss may be between 20-30 per cent, Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers President Sukhjit Singh Bhatti said recently.Potato growers said the rain mainly damaged potato varieties like Pukhraj and Jyoti in the crop-growing belt of Jalandhar and Kapurthala,which are known for growing seed potato.The maximum impact of rain was visible in the areas of Adampur,Bhogpur,Kartarpur,Kapurthala and Shakot, said another potato growerIt may be noted that Punjab State,which received two bumper crops one in February 2011,second in October 2011,was also expecting third bumper crop in a row in February 2012.With untimely rains damaging crop,harvesting of the tuber has been delayed by 10 days. Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) president Jaswinder Singh Sangha has already demanded that the state government carry out a loss assessment in affected areas for awarding suitable compensation.Whether we produce bumper crop or face damage,the potato growers are always in trouble due to indifferent attitude of the government, said Chattha Iqbal Chattha,the JPGA press secretary.He added that the a huge part of the crop now lies rotten in the field and can not be harvested. No girdawari has been carried out till date, he added. Under the Indian land record system,Girdawari is the record of land cultivation. It records the amount of produce and ownership of the crop.Director,Horticulture Department,Lajwinder Singh Brar,confirmed that tuber crop has suffered damage but added that the actual damage is yet to assessed by the department.Notably,the Doaba region leads the state in potato production. Punjab grows potatoes over an area of over 85,000 hectares,out of which 25 per cent area falls in Jalandhar district. Nearly 2.1 million tonnes of potatoes are harvested in state.Having already faced heavy losses due to low prices of potatoes,Punjab farmers say the drop in production will further compound their woes.Earlier,we had to throw our crop on the road because of low rates and now,lower yield will turn out to be another big blow for growers, Sangha said.Punjab farmers threw potato crops in large quantities on roads in December last year,after market rates fell due to oversupply and after government failed to provide adequate freight subsidy to transport the crop to other state.Since long potato growers have been urging the state government that either it should export their produce or provide freight subsidy so that the farmers could transport the crop to other states.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Dubey has been attending meetings such as this one with different sections of society to learn the peoples view before taking a final decision on the hike.The Commission has received a recommendation of a 55 per cent hike in power tariff rate from the Punjab State Power Corporation limited (PSPCL). The new rates will be applicable from April 1. PSPCL projected a gap of Rs 8,983 crores in aggregate revenue requirement for the year 2012-13 and it is to bridge this gap that the tariff hike has been proposed. Representatives of different associations at the meeting,however,expressed their displeasure at the proposal. President of Federation of Jalandhar Industrial and Traders Association,Gursharan Singh,said the burden of the power subsidy given to the agriculture sector by the government is being borne by the industry.He said that this free power given to the agricultural sector is being misused hugely and that PSPCL should check such misuse as well as cases of power theft and transmission losses of electricity instead of hiking the tariff. Many industrialists pointed out that if an industrialist applies for a connection,he is forced to pay the entire cost of laying the line from the feeder transformers to the location of his industry and then other consumers are allowed to use the connection from the same line without being chargedanything. They were of the opinion that Punjabs industry is already reelingunder huge crises and anew burden of tariff would ruin it.Apart from industrialists,there were other sections of society that voiced their concerns. On behalf of the farming community,Jung Bahadur Singh Sangha,a well known potato farmer,said the Cold Stores,which need 16 hours of regular power supply as they hold perishable items,are not being provided adequate power.Representatives of educational institutions also lamented that they were never supplied more than 4000 KW of power,whereas they need more power than that to meet the demands of their students. Others present at the meeting complained that neighbouring states like Haryana and Himachal Pradesh have far less power tariff rates than Punjab. Dubey later told mediapersons that the State Electricity Regulatory Commission would keep the commitment of the new state government regarding continuation of subsidy in the agricultural sector,but new rates for power tariff would be decided after obtaining feedback from all section of society.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
68,SP puts prestige at stake in Kannauj,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/SP-puts-prestige-at-stake-in-Kannauj/articleshow/11920122.cms,2012-02-17,The Times Of India,"KANNAUJ: Although SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav has put at stake the prestige of his son and successor at the three assembly constituencies of Kannauj for ""all-round development of the area"", he has very little to support his claim. This is because despite being the parliamentary seat of Yadav junior, Kannauj stands out as the poor cousin of Safai in terms of facilities and infrastructure enjoyed by the latter.What's appalling is the fact that Samajwadi Party (SP) leadership has only itself to blame for not ushering the dawn of development in Kannauj. The reasons are quite obvious: two out of three assembly seats of Sadar and Chhibramau are held by the party while Akhilesh is the member of Parliament (MP) from Kannauj. This means that there is no dearth of funds for development which otherwise is cited by parties and candidates for their lackadaisical approach for the development of any constituency.Kannauj, the seat of ancient emperor Harshvardhan's empire and repository of rich archeological and cultural heritage of the past, has virtually nothing to offer for the present. Though being a SP stronghold, the Yadav clan has a tough job at hand as the ""attar"" (perfume) capital of India is fast losing its fragrance. The mainstay of Kannauj's sagging economy ""attar"" industry, which earlier sustained the livelihood of a large section of local populace, is today fighting a grim battle for its survival.Perhaps the SP is also privy to the seething discontent among the locals as far as the issue of sidetracking development of key areas at the cost of building the fortunes of their home turf, Safai. Apprehensive of voters' backlash, the SP chief has drummed up all resources and put Akhilesh at the centre stage of campaigning in the area to drive home the message that ""wrongs done in the past would be rectified in future"".As stage gets set for polling on February 19, development certainly seems to be playing a dominant role in Kannauj which has three assembly seats: Kannauj Sadar (reserve), Tirwa (formerly Umarda) and Chhibramau. ""At stake here is the future of over 120 big factories and hundreds of smaller ones engaged in bottling of perfumes. Over 2 crore people in the state are directly or indirectly dependent on 'attar' industry.Largely exported, 'attar' is also used in masala/gutka industry which is facing a tough time following SC ruling. 'Attar', also used in agarbatti manufacturing, has high demand in cosmetics industry. ""Earlier, we used to get even 20-22 hours of power supply, which has now dipped to 8-10 hours. Though distillation of perfume does not involve electricity, other activities related to making perfume do. It's a battle of survival for the industry,"" said Saifullah, a prominent 'attar' exporter.His views were echoed by another exporter, Faisal. ""The tough and apathetic attitude of the government has seen the gutka industry's growth and sales dip by almost 70 -80%. Even the price of sandal oil used by us has sky-rocketed -- from Rs 10,000 per liter about two decades back to nearly a lakh today,"" said Faisal who also rued lack of infrastructural development in the region.The SP shifts the burden to BSP. ""Development here has been stalled by the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) government as it is a SP stronghold. Besides the parliamentary seat, SP holds two of the three assembly seats -- Kannauj Sadar and Chhibramau, with the BSP holding the Tirwa (formerly Umarda) seat. Poor infrastructure like non-availability of electricity and shabby roads have stalled the growth of local industries,"" said SP candidate and sitting MLA from Chhibramau, Arvind Singh.""As potato is the prominent crop in the region, we would ensure after coming to power that potato-based industries are set up in the region to boost the economy and lessen the burden on 'attar' industry,"" claimed Arvind Singh, who seconded SP chief Mulayam's claim that more cold storages would be built in the area so that the recent catastrophe, where hundreds of tonnes of potato could not be sold and had to be dumped in fields and roads to accommodate the new yield, could be avoided.Most of the cold storages are in the Chhibramau area, a prominent potato growing belt.A Chhibramau cold storage manager, Vishesh Chauhan, said: ""Not only the potato farmers, but each and every cold storage owner has suffered losses in the previous season."" Added Shivraj Yadav, a potato farmer, ""Earlier, the potato market used to record 80-100 metric tones of sale daily, but now the sale has dipped to 25-30 metric tonnes. Extreme cold during this season too has taken a toll on the potato crop. The district agriculture office has done nothing to save it from 'jhulsa' disease.""Tahir Siddiqui of the BSP, who is contesting from the Chhibramau seat, agreed that development was the main issue. ""If we win this seat held by the SP, we will ensure that stalled development projects are renewed,"" he said. He, however, blamed the SP for neglecting the area's development.Traditionally, Kannauj has seen pitched battles for political supremacy between the SP and BSP. In the 2008 assembly polls, Anil Kumar of the SP had defeated Kalyan Singh Dohre of BSP on Kannauj Sadar seat. Kannauj' Umardha seat was won by BSP's Kailash Singh Rajput, who defeated Vijay Bahadur Pal of SP. The Chhibramau seat went to Arvind Singh of SP. Jai Kumar Tewari of BSP remained the runners up.From Kannauj Sadar (Reserved) seat, BJP's Banwari Lal Dohre, BSP's Mahendra Kumar and Congress party's Vishram Singh Katheria are pitted against sitting SP MLA Anil Dohre. Similarly, from newly constituted Tirwa seat (after scrapping of Umardha), Congress's Digambar Singh, BSP's Kailash Singh, BJP's Alok Verma and SP's Vijay Bahadur Pal are in the fray.Likewise, Chhibramau seat is witnessing a fight amongst BJP's Archana Pandey, BSP's Tahir Husain Siddiqui, Congress party's Chotey Singh Yadav and sitting SP MLA Arvind Singh Yadav. Though on all the seats, it's a direct contest between the SP and BSP.Friendly fights:Interestingly, Kannauj is also witnessing some ""friendly fights"". While the ruling BSP has fielded Mahendra Kumar on Kannauj Sadar assembly (Reserved) seat, his wife Anita Singh is in the fray as an Independent. Similarly, Congress candidate Vishram Singh Katheria, who is contesting from the same assembly segment, is opposed by his son Bhupendra Singh Katheria, who is also in the fight for the Kannauj Sadar seat as an Independent.From the newly constituted Tirwa assembly segment, Ramshanker Lodhi has been fielded by the Jankranti Party. His wife Neelam Devi is in the fray from the same seat. Similarly, BSP candidate Kailash Rajput's brother Sanjay Singh is being pitted against him as an Independent.""It's almost confusing, 'Bhaiyya' will win and 'Bhabhi' will lose or 'Bhabhi' will win and 'Bhaiyya' will lose. It will be an interesting fight for the candidates as well voters of the area,"" a local Rajesh Singh said.However, while canvassing, Neelam Devi does not forget to remind voters that she is the ""Bahu of Tirwa"" ""and like your Bhaiyya, will share your joys and sorrow"".""It could be a real messy situation this time in the election. There are four such candidates, who are blood relations and are in the fray. Election at Kannauj Sadar and Tirwa assembly seats will be interesting,"" said another local."

When he returned around 7.30pm, he could hardly walk, said Raghab Santra, Madhabs cousin.Neighbours rushed in after Madhabs wife, two daughters and son raised the alarm. He was taken to the rural hospital 8km away where he died around midnight.Madhab is the ninth farmer to have committed suicide in Burdwan since November.Raghab said Madhab was forced to sell the two-and-a-half quintals of paddy he had cultivated last year to middlemen at Rs 600 per quintal, much below the minimum support price of Rs 1,080.But a bigger blow came when most of the potato crop he cultivated after that was destroyed by blight. To add to his misfortune, the tomatoes and cucumbers he cultivated next were destroyed by worms. Madhab had a debt of Rs 50,000 accumulated over three years, Raghab said.Another cousin of Madhav, Jadav, said: He had also taken a loan of Rs 25,000 from a cooperative society to buy fertilisers and pesticides."

The government has already issued notices to them for acquiring their land, measuring 803 hectare.Interestingly, Mahajan is heading a parliamentarians' committee, which has been set up by the government to look into the old Land Acquisition Act, 1894, to bring out the necessary amendments into it.Some of the villages that are likely to be affected by the project in the area include Kalibillod, Ranmalbillod, Shairipur, Shankarpura and Sindhipura.Dr Rajendra Sharma, who is a member of Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, which is protesting the government's move, said that nearly 250 farmers hailing from seven affected villages have already got a stay from the state high court against the land acquisition.Still, the government was in a hurry to acquire the land for the project, he said.The Mahajan committee has recommended that the farmers, who are affected by the acquisition, must be compensated by being given land measuring six times the market price of the land which had been acquired from them.But, the Union cabinet has sent the report back to the committee as it wanted that only four times of the market value of the land, being acquired from the farmers should be given.The committee's report is likely to be presented in the parliament during its forthcoming budget session.""Our land is fertile and suitable for growing crops like gram, wheat, vegetables, tomato, brinjal, potato and soybean. We are happy with that,"" said a farmer.Talking to TOI, Mahajan said, ""I've personally visited the area and asked the district collector to look into the matter. Forest land was also there which can also be used for the project."""

If the turnout was anything to go by, Sunday's Brigade rally definitely appeared to be the much-needed morale booster that could pull the party out of the abyss it has plummeted to over the last couple of years.Bolstered by loud cheers from nearly million-strong party supporters, CPM lambasted the chief minister and her government for its all-round ""failure"" over the months. However, the decibel soared when CPM leaders condemned the spate of farmer deaths across the state and the government's apparent reluctance to address the issue.CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee buried their difference and raised their voice against the Trinamool government in unison. They claimed such (farmer) deaths never took place when the Left was in power.Keeping an eye on 2013 panchayat polls, the CPM has engaged two private agencies to bring out the ""truth"".Mamata had earlier claimed that only one farmer died unable to fetch price for paddy. ""Others died due to personal problems,"" she had said.""The Center's policies  of which Trinamool is a partner  have resulted in 2.56 lakh peasants committing suicide country-wide . In West Bengal, these incidents were neither witnessed nor heard in the last 34 years. Around 32-33 peasants have died within nine months,"" Karat said.The CPM general secretary also criticized Trinamool for its ""dual voice at the Centre and Kolkata"". ""Why is Trinamool silent on the Food Security Bill? Nor does it say anything on the 2G spectrum scam,"" he queried. Taking a cue from his party colleague, Bhattacharjee painted a broader picture and expressed his worries over possibilities that the state can slip into a food crisis.""Does any peasant choose to end his life simply for the pleasure of it? It isn't just paddy. Jute and potato cultivators are also making distress sales. Now even borough cultivation will not reach the half-way mark of what it was last year. Are we staring at a food crisis? We were a food surplus state. Can any farmer tolerate this? The panchayats have been made defunct. The officers are now deciding everything. Is this what we had wanted?"" he retorted.Taking the vitriolic attack a step ahead, opposition leader Surjya Kanta Mishra alleged, ""There is an attempt to silence the opposition both inside the assembly and outside it. But if people are with us, they can't . It isn't easy to wipe out red flags from Bengal. Those holding aloft the tricolour should soon realise this and come to our fold."""

Photo:M.Srinath.It is important to be physically active all day long than go for a perfunctory walk for half and hour and turn into a couch potato for the rest of the day.The statement coming in the middle of an intriguingly titled session, Is weight loss a waste of time in Type 2 diabetes mellitus?' evoked guffaws and nods of agreement from doctors at the annual diabetes conference on Sunday.Sustained and persistent lifestyle modification and not a flash-in-the pan effort is required to achieve weight loss for prevention and control of diabetes, asserted Usha Sriram, senior consultant endocrinologist and director, ACCER, Chennai, at the pre-lunch session in the conference hosted by the Diabetes Club of Tiruchi.To that end, being physically active is more important than half an hour of exercise.Sustained weight loss is possible only when an activity is fun and not treated as a chore. It is common for people to raise questions like Should I go for a walk or join a gym?'. Walking a dog or gardening may contribute effectively to diabetes management than a detested early morning walk. But activities like gymming and jogging can work for those who love it.Noting that weight loss in some cases is motivated by spending money and herd mentality, she said people would lose money but not weight in the longer run as they are driven by guilt of spending money.Yet it is necessary to reinforce weight reduction and promote healthy lifestyle for multiple studies have proved that lifestyle modification can contribute effectively to prevention and control of diabetes.Exercise cannot substitute or equate calorific restriction through diet for exercise tones muscles, makes people feel fit and happier. Even if you burn 30 calories during a walk, even a can of Pepsi or a bag of chips can bring you back to square one. But it is important to strike a balance between diet and physical activity as only so much can be controlled by eating.It is important to realise that weight loss does not work scientifically always or follow the first rule of thermodynamics. Sustained weight loss is not possible with controlled eating on weekdays and binging on the weekend.The body adapts by lowering metabolic rates when an individual is set on a diet and the body's metabolism cannot handle feasting on the weekend.Though weight loss is possible it is not easy. It is not a waste of time, but definitely consumes time, admitted Dr. Usha. Sustained engagement of practitioners and patients is necessary for effective control of diabetes.Doctors must empower patients by educating them on the safe way to lose weight. The mantra lies in reinforcement that persistent lifestyle modification will work."

Fruit-sellers from Mandai said over 36 tonnes of kavath,18 tonnes of sweet potatoes and over six tonnes of dates were sold in the past three days and over 50 kg of each on Monday.As Maha Shivaratri was on a Monday this year,the increase in the sale of kavath and ratnaloo was the most on Sunday. People bought them in bulk, said Gulshan Shahu,owner of Shree Swami Samarth Fruit Stall. Though the sales nearly doubled as compared to a regular day,fruit-sellers claimed the profit margin would be less this year. Owing to the unpredictable weather and the dip in temperatures,we could not stock the kavaths for a long period, said Usha Saikar,manager,Saikar Fruits at Shivaji Market. Saikar especially brought in eight tonnes of wood apples from Western Maharashtra,where it is mainly grown,ahead of Shivratri.We had increased the price of kavath by Re 1 only to meet the demand during Shivratri, said Saikar,who sold the wood apples for Rs 3 apiece and Rs 20 a dozen. The sweet potatoes were sold at Rs 40 a kg,depending on size and ripeness. Ripened potatoes sell more during Shivratri as most of them are consumed raw, said Rajendra Dimber of Sant Tukaram Vegetable Mart at Mandai. Dimber marked a record sale of over 53 kg of sweet potatoes on Sunday.However,black dates,which sold at Rs 60 a kg three days ago,rose to Rs 100 a kg at many fruit stalls in Mandai on Sunday. Sugar-coated black dates are easy to preserve. They have been much in demand lately as we have used diet-free sugar syrups, added Suresh Salunke of Sai Leela Fruit Merchants,Gokhale Nagar. The diet-free sugar dates were sold at an increased rate of Rs 80 a kg.Also,fruits such as musk melons,grapes and strawberries witnessed brisk sales at Mandai stalls.

76,Land acquisition may nag BSP,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Land-acquisition-may-nag-BSP/articleshow/12038959.cms,2012-02-26,The Times Of India,"ZIKARPUR/KANSERA/JAHANGARH (ALIGARH): It was in August 2010 when hundreds of farmers of Zikarpur village rose against the Mayawati government protesting its high-handedness in acquiring their fertile land. Eighteen months later, the mention of the uprising still leaves them angry. Any outsider enquiring about the August agitation or land acquisition is looked upon with suspicion.""Are you from the government,"" villagers ask. ""We fear seeing an outsider here, what if the person has come from the JP Group (construction company) to coax us into signing the contract,"" says Raj Kumari of Zikarpur village. Raj Kumari and her husband Lakhpat Singh haven't signed the contract to give away their land. ""I will rather fall to the bullet than letting them snatch my land,"" she says.The moot question is will the farmers' anger reflect in electoral results. Interestingly, farmers, who were waging a war against the government till a month back, now talk in a different tone. Most of them say caste is the dominant factor in the election. ""Jats are confused. The rich folks might go with BSP, others with RLD,"" says Ravinder Baliyan.The Brahmins in the area don't want BSP to return to power. ""They have pledged support to the BJP,"" he adds. The violence-ravaged villages in Khair constituency of Aligarh are Jat dominated. During the farmers agitation, Jats were most vocal. Jats had planned to hold a meeting and decide their strategy. But, now, when voting is just few days away they are still undecided which party to vote for.""No meeting happened. The acquisition issue is still relevant but farmers are not united,"" says Ramgopal Sharma, a farmer. Besides Jats, Zikarpur also has a good presence of Khatiks, Muslims and Jatavs. There are no brahmins here. The vast mustard fields, pucca roads, double-storey houses, swanky SUVs and thriving dairy business, show the village's prosperity. With its 1,100 voters, it can't be called a small village. Farmers from Kansera, Tappal, Jahangarh, Kirpalpur and Udaipur had congregated at Zikarpur on August 14, 2010, when the protest turned ugly.In Zikarpur alone, more than 550 hectare land has been acquired. Farmers like Kailashi Devi are still tilling their land, defying the government. Devi brands the BSP government as ""the biggest cheat"". In Zikarpur, about 400 farmers haven't accepted government compensation while 57 farmers have approached the court.""We want a higher compensation, at par with Noida,"" says Zikarpur pradhan Mukesh Kumar. The government offered Zikarpur farmers Rs 517 per sq mt as compensation. On the contrary, Noida has three rates of compensation -- between Rs 880 per sq mt to Rs 1,400 per sq mt. Though Kumar says farmers have yet not decided which political party to support, he denies it will be BSP. Villagers say their land was forcibly acquired.""One day, government officers accompanied by police came to our village and told us about the deal,"" recalled Bhagwati Prasad, whose 7 bigha land was acquired in Kansera village, which is adjacent to Zikarpur. Kansera lost one of its men, Rafiq, in August 2010 clashes. Kansera, too, has some 20-odd farmers who lost their land. The village is dominated by Jats, Jatavs and Muslims. There are very few Brahmins, only 58 out of 1,000 voters. Surprsingly, Brahmins like Bhagwati Prasad and Jatavs like Kalua are not very vocal about their resentment against land acquisition. Though they are not happy with the compensation, they do not want to fight against the government like Jats. Subhash Sharma, pradhan of Kansera, evades questions on violence or the farmers' agitation. ""I did not lose my land, so I can't say much on the issue,"" he says.Sharma, a Brahmin, won pradhan election by getting the support from classes.""I didn't know I was going to contest the election. My name was proposed by them (villagers)"", he says sitting outside one of his palatial granitefurnished houses at Kansera. In Kansera, most of the villagers have accepted the compensation. What has hurt farmers the most is the acquisition of fertile land on the pretext that it was `banjar' and unfit for agriculture. ""We grow everything on this land, from potatoes to pulses to mustard to wheat and rice. Whatever you grow, you get good harvest,"" says Tulsi Ram, a small farmer in Jahangarh, another Jat and Jatav dominated village.Farmers allege the government resorted to coercion and arm-twisting to make them sign the contracts. Jahangarh has some 50-odd farmers who have lost their land. The family of village pradhan Gyan Chand lost maximum, 64 bigha. ""We haven't taken the compensation amount yet. Some of us have taken, others haven't,"" says Gyan's younger brother Prem Chand. Jahangarh has some 1,350 voters. The villagers allege that government officers accompanied by policemen came to their houses and forced them to sign the contract.""I was adamant I will not give my land, but one night officers came to my house with police and threatened to put me in jail if I did not sign the contract,"" says Hardutt, the village headman. People going to attend the court hearings were picked up from the way. The relatives and family members of protesting villagers employed in the government jobs were also harassed. Mostly small farmers, who possessed 3 to 4 bigha land, have signed the contracts and accepted the government compensation. Farmers allege small farmers, were lured into signing the contracts. ""People who have been left in penury after their land went to the government had no option but to give up,"" says Prem Chand. The government, Jahangarh farmers allege, resorted to 'divide and rule' tactic too.Farmers who got money chose to remain silent or backed off. Poor farmers like Chandra Pal, who lost his 12-year old son Prashant to violence and his 4.5 beegha land to government, do not have much to look forward. ""I have been left with a meagre 1.5 bigha,"" he says. The farmers say while leaders from other political parties, including Rahul Gandhi, visited them, no one from the BSP ever came. In Khair, farmers predict it will be a fight between RLDCongress, BJP and BSP."

82,Ban bleeds state farmers,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/ban-bleeds-state-farmers/,2012-03-07,Indian Express,"Parshottam Ruda,a farmer from Mahuva in Bhavnagar district,destroyed several kgs of onion in January when prices plummeted to an all-time low. Now,he doesnt know what to do with half of his cotton crop when the Centre from Monday imposed immediate ban on the cotton export.Market has crashed even as auction was halted across yard in Saurashtra. I still have left more than half of my yield in store. I dont know what to do, Parshottam said.This is the plight of most of the farmers in Gujarat. The state has already seen potatoes and onion glut. Blanket ban on raw cotton was the last thing farmers,traders and ginners wanted in the state. The result is: fate of over 20 lakh bales is hanging in the balance. This also include 10 lakh bales that have been lying at ports for the export. This year,the state has seen bumper crop over 1.20 crore bales.The Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Monday had written a letter to Centre demanding lift of the ban.The leaders have been calling this a worse year in recent times.This is clearly the worst year for farmers in recent times. The farmers are not in a position to recover even production cost, Bhartiya Kisan Sangh secretary Praful Senjalia said. The Sangh on Tuesday took out rallies at various cities in Saurashtra demonstrating against cotton export ban. Potatoes and onion prices had plummeted to almost Rs 1 to 5 per kg,which has registered only significant hike to Rs 10 by now.The prices of cotton plummeted by 5 per cent on Tuesday. Till Sunday it was around Rs 33,000 per candy.The sudden ban with no reason has spread panic among farmers. If ban was not enough,even quota that was waiting for shipment has also been stopped, said Saurashtra Ginners Association president Bharat Vala,adding,Not only monetary loss,which will be huge,the ban will also spoil image of Indian traders in international market for failing to provide material after signing deals. Vala and other experts have been putting the loss for Gujarat in wake of ban to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore.Ginning mills to observe bandhAs many as 1,000 ginning mills in the state will observe a two-day bandh from Wednesday in protest against the Centres decision to ban export of cotton.We have decided to suspend work at ginning mills on March 7 and March 8 against the Centres decision to ban cotton export, President of Saurashtra Ginners Association Bharat Vala said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
83,BSP wins Jewar; RLD bags Khair,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/BSP-wins-Jewar-RLD-bags-Khair/articleshow/12169076.cms,2012-03-07,The Times Of India,"LUCKNOW: The victory of BSP candidate Vedram Bhati in Jewar constituency of Gautam Budh Nagar indicates that votes were polled on the development plank in the region. Analysts attribute this to three factors -- constituency's proximity to the National Capital Region; voters already reaping fruits of development, and supporters of Behenji outnumbering those who clamoured on their land being acquired by the state government.Though forcible land acquisition is still a raging issue in the twin villages of Bhatta-Parsaul, in Jewar block of Gautam Budh Nagar farmers did not go by it entirely to decide their choice of candidates. ""People in this area want development and their number is more compared to those who agitated over land acquisition in the region,"" said political analyst Sudhir Panwar.The economic uplift is already evident in the region. Land prices have gone up and people from other districts and cities are investing in land here. Political expert Arunodaya Bajpai summed up the expectation of locals: ""Yamuna Expressway will bring better colleges, hospitals and hotels to the region. Cherishing similar expectations, voters here might have voted for BSP.""In the districts along the Yamuna Expressway, which witnessed farmers unrest in 2010 and 2011, there were several factors that influenced election results. Among these were the farmers' movement against BSP's acquisition policy, support offered by opposition parties to farmers at the time, caste composition, permanent issues like potato glut, lack of ware-houses and cold storages and civic problems.Since Rahul Gandhi was the first leader to have visited the villages and spoken to aggrieved farmers, Congress-RLD alliance gained. Congress' Dhirendra Singh was placed second in Jewar. He was given ticket for stealthily driving in Rahul at Bhatta, immediately after the farmers-police clash in May last year. He was defeated by more than 9,000 votes by Bhati.Another area which witnessed violence over land acquisition was Tappal under Khair constituency of Aligarh. The villages which witnessed violence are Jat-dominated. Their say was evident in the result in Khair (reserved) seat. Bhagwati Prasad of RLD won from Khair defeating Rajrani of BSP by more than 38,000 votes.Farmer agitation in Aligarh had already distanced Jats and other caste groups from BSP, strengthening the prospects of the RLD and the poll results confirmed it. Locals said another reason for RLD was that Khair is a reserved seat.Till now, parties used to field Jat candidates from the seats and that led to division of Jat votes. This time, however, Jat votes went to RLD. In Bhatta-Parsaul, while Jats cried hoarse over land acquisition even before the votes were polled, locals foresaw Jat votes getting divided between BSP and RLD."

In February last year, it was 9.54 per cent.Inflation in food articles accelerated on an annual basis in February to 6.07 per cent. It was -0.52 per cent in January, as per official data. Food articles have 14.3 per cent share in the WPI basket.Besides, pulses turned expensive by 7.91 per cent and vegetables by 1.52 per cent. Prices of vegetables had declined 43.13 per cent in January.Although the government was hopeful that inflation would decline to 6 per cent by March end, the latest figures show that it would continue to hover above the projected level and would necessitate fiscal steps to combat price rise.Mukherjee may announce steps to contain price rise in the Budget 2012-13, to be presented in the Lok Sabha on March 16.Experts said RBI will hold on to the policy rates in its mid-quarterly policy review meeting on Thursday as it has already injected Rs 48,000 crore liquidity last week by reducing Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) for banks.RBI, which had hiked policy rates several times up to October to tame inflation, has said the government needs to take fiscal steps, like reducing supply bottlenecks and subsidies, to tame price rise.With inflation still a problem and the growth side of the economy improving, we see little chance of an interest rate cut on Thursday, said Glenn Levine, Senior Economist, Moodys Analytics.In February, egg, meat and fish prices rose 20 per cent, year-on-year. The rate or price rise was 18.63 per cent in January. Milk became expensive by 11.70 per cent, while rice and cereals turned costlier by 1.53 per cent and 1.71 per cent respectively.However, prices of potato and onion declined by 2.22 per cent and 48.50 per cent year-on-year in February.Prices of manufactured items, which have a weight of around 65 per cent in the WPI basket, went up by 5.75 per cent year-on-year in February, as against 6.49 per cent in the previous month.From October onwards, there were inflationary pressure on manufacturing sector, but there has been easing, Mukherjee said.Inflation in the fuel and power segment was 12.83 per cent on an annual basis. The rate of price rise was 14.21 per cent in the previous month.We expect the RBI to leave the Repo Rate unchanged. The elevated price of crude oil stoking domestic inflationary pressures poses a significant concern, ICRA Economist Aditi Nayar said.Crisil Chief Economist D K Joshi said, The current inflation figure is due to the food prices only.Meanwhile, Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, on Thursday, projected the headline inflation to remain below 7 per cent during March.We will get the March inflation number sometime in the middle of April. I think we will have inflation possibly below 7 per cent, Montek Singh said."

And, with the precedent set by Monday's verdict, public interest would be the prime concern, said Dr. Sahai. She said that Gene Campaign had steered a movement for recognising farmers' rights from the early 1990s.Monday's ruling says that even if a company holds a patent over a particular product, licence for producing it can be granted to another if public interest is harmed. Farmers too need such strong protection so that they could take assertive action. The verdict also took away some of the negative impacts of changing our patent law in 2005, she said.Food Bill a gimmick'The Food Security Bill, expected to be presented in the current session of Parliament, was a political gimmick that ignored the real spectre of an agrarian crisis, she said.India is in an agrarian crisis and yet the Bill has been drafted by the National Advisory Council as another version of the Public Distribution System. It talks only about distribution and not about production. Farmers are leaving agriculture in large numbers and the Bill only discusses who will be included or excluded from being given subsidised food.Dr. Sahai accused the government of ignoring scientists, farmers, and public policy experts in formulating the Food Security Bill. She said the government had taken the easy path and not the desired path.Union Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution K.V. Thomas was defending a bad Bill and she called for the broadening of its ambit. How could you have food security when there was no enough production? she asked.The Food Security Bill should address production, distribution, and ensure that there was sufficient absorption of food by the beneficiaries, she said listing out the three pillars of ensuring food security in the country.Dr. Sahai called for raising production by incentivising farmers and decentralisation and diversification of procurement. Centralising production was not the answer to addressing food security issues. Pumpkins and sweet potatoes could be procured instead of the government confining itself to wheat and rice, she said.Another key issue, she said, was food absorption. India had the highest under-five mortality rate in the world because there was no clean drinking water available to a large population, who are threatened by rampant diarrhoea. If you have no clean drinking water and proper sanitation there was no use of providing nutritious food, she added."

Apart from a few sops announced on R&D and agriculture that benefit the industry, consumers will have to digest an across-the-board excise duty increase, making packaged food products and ready-to-eat products costlier.The divisional chief executive (foods) of ITC, Chitranjan Dar, said there will be an impact across all food categories. ""We are now assessing the actual impact,"" he said. Dar said processed food products like biscuits used to attract different excise duties at 5% and 10%. Both have gone up by 1% and 2%, respectively.""The hike in excise, service tax and transportation will have an impact on prices. We will have to work out the final consumer price after taking into account all these factors. However, benefits to farmers and on agriculture will be positive for the sector,"" said RS Sodhi, managing director, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation.Reduction in basic customs duty on probiotics from 10% to 5%, would benefit the likes of Amul. But the increase in excise duty on ice-cream and flavoured milk from 1% to 2% at the onset of the summer season, may not augur well for the largest maker of ice-cream. ""We had represented to the government to remove excise on these products which are largely consumed by the children and youth. The excise duty on chocolates and malted milk food also has increased from 10% to 12%, again affecting the kids and youth,"" said Sodhi.Those who are health conscious have not been spared either. Prices of low fat spreads and margarine could go up as excise duty has been hiked by 1% to 6%. However, prices of soya food products would come down because of excise duty reduction. Dinesh Shahra, managing director, Ruchi Soya Industries, said benefits from reduction in excise duty on soya food products to 6% will be passed down to the consumer.""A few of the positives of the budget include raising the plan outlay for agriculture by 18%, initiatives for R&D in agriculture, allocations for improving warehousing and storage facilities for agricultural produce. All of these, executed well and on time, will address the supply side on food and agriculture that will drive domestic demand and consumption, which is one of the key priority areas,"" said Vinita Bali, managing director, Britannia Industries.As to whether this will impact growth of the Rs 2,50,000-crore food processing industry, Rasna's chairman Piruz Khambatta said: ""Food processing industry will grow in spite of the government... it will grow because people want to eat more processed foods.""Keventer Agro MD Mayank Jalan said potato chip will cost more as there is a hike from 10% to 12%. But Nadia Chauhan Kurup, joint managing director & chief marketing officer, Parle Agro, said with the season just around the corner, the company would not pass on the excise duty hikes to consumers."
88,The Lager Picture,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/the-lager-picture/,2012-03-18,Indian Express,"It may be time to get over Zenzi,the iconic Bandra-based restobar that changed the cultural scene in Mumbai. It will,however,remain with the patrons in spirit. After all,where else could people go to access independent artistes,DJs,stand-ups and salsa in the early 2000s,before restobars such as Bonobo,Blue Frog and the likes came about? Lagerbay,the new watering hole in Bandra,will never replace the former. But it isnt attempting to either,and this is where it scores its brownie points.Walk into the restaurant and theres an immense sense of space. The dcor is different,uber cool,with large artworks featuring Bob Marley in black-and-white,among other pop art posters and a retro-style microphone that doesnt magnify anything but the vibe of the place. The regular patron will,however,tell you that there are still a few traces of Zenzi scattered around. The fake wooden flooring from the previous restaurant has been buffed and shined,as have the restrooms. Even the structure of the interiors and the two bar counters have been retained. Thats about it,because the room once reserved for live gigs is nicely lit for a sit-down restaurant whereas the inside exudes the vibe of a dimly lit bar.This works for the place as the food menu has a lot more than just nibbles. It starts with a selection of soups such as cream of mushroom and salads such as malta orange and red radish. But unless youre really into health food,you want to try the the spiced potato wedges,which may be piping hot but their crisp and buttery texture with paprika makes up for the initial mouthburn.The service is impressive as the waiter will warn you when ordering the Prawns and Calamari Ajilo that it isnt a dry finger food,but a saucy number. Its worth ordering despite the fishy smell because the broth,flavoured with butter,gently hints of garlic and is delicious enough to slurp straight from the bowl.The Vegetarian Fettuccini Noodles come with bell peppers and broccoli but the paprika cream sauce overpowers everything with its cheesy layer of white. The Kingfish on a Bed of Spinach comes with a delightfully light cup of lemon-butter but can go wrong if the chef keeps it in the oven too long,leaving it hard and stringy. A clear winner is the Parmesan Crusted Grilled Chicken  two crisp slices of meat served with a cup of grape sauce (with actual pieces of black grape). Somehow,the expectations from dessert arent quite so high but that changes after one bite of the soft blueberry cheesecake that has hidden pockets of the purple sauce that ooze out as you get to the centre.With pleasant food,good service and reasonably priced alcohol,inclusive of alcohol taxes,the place looks like it is here to stay. The only complaint would have to be filed against the name Lagerbay. With seven varieties of beer on the menu,the name could have been saved for a microbrewery or a pub with a lot more lagers on their menu.Meal for two with alcohol costs approximately Rs 1,800.

89,"Debate on green vs rainbow crop  

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120318/jsp/bihar/story_15262921.jsp,2012-03-18,Telegraph,"Patna, March 17: Bihar ministers seem to be riding high on the world record of 729 quintals of potatoes on a hectare created by a farmer in Nalanda. At a seminar today, two state ministers stressed that the green revolution, which is showing positive results in the state, was not enough. The state is aiming to create a rainbow revolution rather than a green revolution by increasing investment just not in foodgrain but also in horticulture, dairy, fruits and vegetables despite the Centre not willing to help the state, food and consumer protection minister Shyam Rajak today said. The minister was addressing a seminar titled Priorities and possibilities of investment for accelerating and stabilising agricultural growth in Bihar in the state capital. The government is serious about improving agricultural growth and increasing self-sufficiency very soon despite the dismal support of the central government. Through the recent agriculture roadmap, Bihar is aiming to create a rainbow revolution rather than green revolution by increasing investment not only in foodgrain but also horticulture, dairy, fruits and vegetables, the minister said. Labour resource minister J.S. Sigriwal was also not far behind. Despite all financial and non-financial constraints, Bihar has provided record productivity in both rice and potato and the government is making all efforts to set examples in terms of providing importance and strengthening agriculture in the state. The investment in agriculture has been substantially increased; the government is conscious of the need for more and scaled-up investment in many sectors in agriculture and making all efforts to meet these requirements, Rajak said. However, P.K. Joshi, director, International Food Policy Research Institute, South Asia, an international think-tank on agriculture and food, said: Bihar needs to match up fast with the changing trends of agriculture and agricultural research. Once this happens, the next step is to scale up investment in livestock, horticulture, and fisheries too, Joshi said. Serious concerns exist about farmers plight in the state though. Ramadhar, the former chairman of Bihar State Farmers Commission, said marketing infrastructure had collapsed and farmers were compelled to sell produce at throwaway prices in villages and the benefit of increased support prices went to middlemen.

But for the past fortnight the high price of Karela, being sold at Rs 80 per kilo, has totally upset the home budget,"" said Navad. And it is not only Karela, the high price of almost all the vegetables has baffled the common man residing in the Sangam city. Cauliflower, cabbage and some selected variety of leafy vegetables, popularly called as saag, prices of almost all other veggie seems to be on fire.Currently green pea, which was available at a nominal price of Rs 10 per kilo, is now being sold at Rs 25-30 per kilogram. A piece of cauliflower is being sold out at Rs 15, which till a fortnight ago, was sold out at a cost of Rs 3 or 4. Likewise, garlic is being sold at Rs 280 per kg, ginger at Rs 100 per kg, and tomato at Rs 40 per kg. Other vegetables have become precious such as lady finger at Rs 50, Capsicum at Rs 50, beans at Rs 40 etc. Local vegetable suppliers claim that there was abundant supply of vegetables in the winter season, but steadily as spring is approaching, there is less supply of vegetables which is resulting into price rise. ''There is no question of stocking since these are daily consumable items only some vendors store onion and potato but that too in a limited quantity and the same hardly affect the prices at the mandi, said a wholesale trader at Mundera mandi of the city which supplies vegetables in the entire city.""The prices of vegetables have ruined our budget and we are hoping that the prices would go down in coming days,"" said Niharika, a house wife. She also added that people have started accepting the increase but they are facing hardship to check it. City residents lament that the prices of all essential commodities have gone up, while salaries have taken a hit. ''authorities should initiate some measures to check the spiralling prices of vegetables,"" she said."

Cucumber was Rs 20 and now costs Rs 40. Our family budget has increased from Rs 3,000 to 4,000. But we have no option because one can't do without vegetables.""Another homemaker Harvinder Kaur, who stays in Pakhowal Road, said, ""There has been about 50% increase in my budget for vegetables and I am cutting short on the variety I buy. Brinjal, lady's finger and bottle gourds are out of my menu these days.

However, there are some things like cauliflower, cabbage, tomato and potato that one cannot avoid in food. We hope that rates will come down soon.''Vegetable sellers in the city justify the costs, claiming that vegetables are being brought from outside the state.

I have already cleared that. Today, I cleared a proposal from UP to have a MSP for potatoes, added Pawar.The onion prices have been declining because of existing storage of onions resulting from high export prices through last year and a good current supply. This is expected to hit farmers hard."
93,Montek’s poor joke,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/erratica/montek-s-poor-joke1/,2012-03-21,The Times Of India,"The boss of the Planning Commission is a man named Moneytek Ahluwalia. So its only logical that he should be clueless on poverty, or the price of potatoes for that matter. After the outrageous Rs 32 per day cutoff as the qualifier for benefits last September, Yojana Bhavan this Monday boasted that the number of Indias poor had declined by 7.3 percentage points between 2004 and 2009. Thats five crore souls. Expectedly, this figure was scoffed at by almost as many people from the other side of the BPL. Perhaps it now stands for Below the Poverty Lie.Well may you be cynical. This magical bequest of dignity came about not by a rise in living standards, but by a lowering of the BPL even further. This time, poverty was calculated at  hold your breath, disbelief and spending decisions  Rs 22.43 per day in rural areas and Rs 28.65 in urban centres. The corresponding figures given by the Planning Commission to the Supreme Court in September were Rs 26 and Rs 32. Respectively, but not respectably.If Pranab babu was accused of presenting a 70s budget last Friday, Montek-ji is guilty of a sleight of hand of the same vintage. In the bad old pre-liberalisation days, the erstwhile family planning ministry routinely crowed that it had met or even surpassed its targets for that year. It conveniently failed to mention that this was achieved only because these were slashed versions of the previous years targets. The apparent is seldom the real regardless of which vital statistic is sought to be enhanced.We can only be philosophical, and sigh that poverty distorts and absolute poverty distorts absolutely. Karl Marx may have had a considerably different take, but ever since UPA-1 decided to jettison the CPM, we have had to follow Groucho instead. The moustachioed funny man had deadpanned about panhandling: Look at me. I worked my way up from nothing to a state of extreme poverty.Whats new anyway about the Planning Commissions depraved version of deprivation? Sarojini Naidus acid comment to Gandhiji on how much it cost the country to keep him in poverty has been renewed with every neta who tries to shove in a political point by travelling in a packed Mumbai local. The latest Gandhi fortunately used his loaf when he set about sharing a farmers dry chapati, and did not have his security guys clearing out the entire village for this photo op.Welfare states know the dangers of poverty becoming a lifestyle choice. But when our politicians get into the act, it is more pernicious. A breathless media plays up every such instance of instant penury  which only adds insult to the injury of a class damned precisely because it is so invisible.Still, we must be grateful for whatever lip service is paid to the poor. Not even our most rabid free marketer would dare echo the British prime minister, who took Thatcherism even further, and last year thundered that there should be an uncompromising crackdown on the benefits cheat. Whatever the accusations against NREGA, we are far away from the blight of the dole-bhaat bum whod rather live on handouts than stand on his own feet.On the contrary, Indias poverty alleviation measures are notorious for elevating the incomes of those entrusted with delivering them to their rightful beneficiaries. You can bet your last ragi roti that the artful siphoners will find ways to dodge the cashless subsidies regime that the finance minister so rightly hopes to bring about with the help of the redeemed Mr Nilekani.Theres another sobering fact. Like poverty, wealth is merely relative. Even Mittal is poor compared to Mukeshbhai. And one mans meat is only another mans envy."
94,A few more deaths in the granary that feeds Bengal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120322/jsp/opinion/story_15272764.jsp,2012-03-22,Telegraph,"A road block put up by farmers demanding fair price for paddy Two years ago, I had travelled to Ausgram in Burdwan to examine how the absence of a robust rural banking system and the dominance of unscrupulous moneylenders had forced a number of farmers to take their own lives. Last week, I returned to Burdwan  this time to Kaltikuri village in Bhatar block where 10 farmers have committed suicide since November last. Similar deaths have been reported from Birbhum, Bankura and Malda, while the South 24 Parganas has recorded 11 deaths. My second visit to the district was prompted by three developments. First, the latest report published by the National Crime Records Bureau on farm suicides between 1995-2002 and 2003-2010 has declared that among all the states in India, West Bengal has registered the biggest decline in such deaths. Between1995-2002, 1,426 farmers had died. The figure fell to 990 in the next 8 years, registering an average decline of 436 deaths. The report was published sometime in December 2011, and, ironically, coincided with the first phase of the fresh spell of suicides that continue to haunt West Bengal. What must be remembered, though, is that a number of these deaths remain unreported or are disputed by the government. Mental depression, debt and alcoholism are some of the reasons that the government has cited to account for the deaths. The new government has announced several institutional measures to ensure that paddy farmers are able to sell their produce at the government approved minimum support price: Rs 1,080 and Rs 1,110 per quintal for coarser and finer varieties of rice, respectively. Farm agencies such as Benfed, Confed and the Essential Commodities Supply Corporation have been directed to set up procurement camps in the district. Rice mill owners have been instructed to pay farmers in cheques to minimize the involvement of middlemen colloquially known as phore or aratdar. The government has also announced that 20 lakh tonnes of paddy will be procured by September. My second reason for visiting Burdwan was to investigate whether these institutional measures are adequate when faced with a crisis. The third reason was to explore the possibility that the government and the media were showing a limited understanding of the complicated structure of an agricultural economy and the resultant contradictions that are integral to it. There has been a sustained campaign to implicate, and hence demonize, phores and rice mill owners in the farmers plight without taking into cognizance the fact that both phores and mills  the allegations of irregularities notwithstanding  play a critical role in the sustenance of the farming community in the absence of credit institutions and access to a ready market. Incidentally, Kanchan Ruidas, a middleman, had hung himself in Galsi block after his business suffered irreparable losses. So it is not as if middlemen have remained immune to debt. In Kaltikuri, I first met a group of cultivators led by S.K. Nurul Islam at the house of Safar Mollah, a paddy farmer who had killed himself in November. In the course of the discussion with the farmers in Kaltikuri and, later, with the secretary of the Burdwan District Rice Mills Association, what emerged was the fact that the present crisis has been aggravated by three factors, each of which needs to be scrutinized in detail. The first, as mentioned earlier, refers to crippling deficiencies in the institutional response. On January 5, the agriculture minister had promised that the government would bear the cost of transporting paddy to procurement camps. A day earlier, the food department announced that 400 camps would be established to procure paddy, while the chief minister ordered the relevant departments to work on a war footing to expedite the distribution of Kisan cards and the setting up of mandis. In Kaltikuri, I was offered a glimpse into how far such promises have been met on the ground. None of the farmers has received any financial assistance to travel to the procurement centres. The first and only time a procurement camp was organized in the village was in early February. The governments campaign to raise awareness about the camps has been as dismal: the reason for the low turn-out of farmers in the procurement camps in Galsi and Bhatar can be attributed to this factor. The effectiveness of these camps has been further compromised by the regulations that guide them. The number of sacks of rice that can be sold in a particular camp is decided by the bureaucracy, which, like the government, has very little idea about the character and needs of the local farming community. Thus, in the camp set up in Kaltikuri in February, only 200 sacks of paddy were bought. This meant that in this village of a hundred families, in which even a marginal farmer owns 20 sacks of paddy, each household could sell only two sacks of paddy. The financial crunch faced by farm agencies has meant that some of Kaltikuris farmers are yet to receive the cheques for the paddy that they sold in February. The Union food secretarys useful suggestion of involving primary agriculture credit cooperative societies (PACCS) in the procurement of paddy on a commission basis, a model that has been implemented with great success in states such as Punjab and Haryana, has perhaps remained on paper. As for measures such as Kisan cards  greatly favoured by the chief minister as well as by Nabard as an instrument for dispensing farm credit  they are yet to become popular with farmers. This is because such loans, I was told, are disbursed in three separate installments. This means that farmers are forced to depend on traditional sources of credit  moneylenders and middlemen  especially at the beginning of the boro or aman seasons, to buy seeds and fertilizers. An added advantage of the local system of credit in the farmers eyes is its accessibility and the absence of the dreaded red tape. To avail of loans from the government, several visits to the supremely inefficient block land record office are mandatory. The acceptance and popularity of the mahajan, phore or aratdar, who is often a relative or a neighbour, can be located in such affiliations as kinship, caste and community, something that is yet to be recognized by the government in a state that has, reportedly, 10 lakh farmers without access to bank loans. These institutional shortcomings expose several other lacunae in the governments farm policy. In December last, it was reported that the Bengal government was yet to renew the Centrally-aided Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme that would have benefited not less than 50,000 farmers who are entitled to receive Rs 5,000 per acre on account of crop loss due to adverse weather. A party that came to power pledging to secure the interests of farmers has shown a marked unwillingness to bear this not-too-extravagant cost. The state government has also failed to check the infiltration of finer varieties of rice from states like Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh that has pushed down prices in Bengal. In the open market in several districts, 60 kilogrammes of rice are being sold at Rs 470. The crisis in Bengal has been aggravated by a good harvest in Bangladesh, one of the key markets for Bengals rice farmers, as also by Bangladeshs decision to import rice from Myanmar. One wonders whether the chief ministers intransigence regarding the sharing of Teestas waters has something to do with Bangladeshs disinclination to import rice from Bengal even after the lifting of trade restrictions. But perhaps the most glaring instance of the governments myopic farm policy is its instruction to rice mill owners not to procure paddy from middlemen. This community of traders has traditionally served as a critical conduit between farmers and rice mills, buying paddy from farmers, admittedly at much lower rates, and then selling the produce to the mills, which, in turn, sell the grain to the government. A better understanding of the inner dynamics of an agrarian economy would have prompted the government to co-opt the community of middlemen in its drive to provide farmers with a fair price. The middlemans utility lies in his personal access to farmers. The government could have utilized his services in reaching the minimum support price to farmers by putting in place a system of commission for the trader. The lure of government commission, together with the threat of stringent penalties for cheating farmers of the minimum support price, could have encouraged middlemen to trade in a fair and transparent manner. Additionally, it would have spared the government the trouble of nudging hesitant banks to do business in villages and of setting up ineffectual procurement camps. The established structure and rituals of an agrarian society would have also remained secure. The loss of the services of the middleman and pressure from the government have put the rice mills in a quandary as well. The depletion in stocks as a result of the loss of supply from middlemen has adversely affected their business. It has also forced mills that traditionally traded in finer varieties of grain to purchase coarser alternatives that have few buyers. For instance, a rice mill in Burdwan that traded in gobindobhog, kaminibhog or tulaipanji is now being forced to buy grain of inferior quality. The mills inability to sell their stock can also be traced to the lack of space in government godowns that are yet to clear last years produce. Dwindling profits have resulted in some mills issuing cheques that have not been honoured by banks, inconveniencing farmers further. The farmer, the trader and the rice mill are parts of the same continuum. Any regressive step that is likely to disturb one particular segment in this chain would impair the other segments as well. But the agrarian policy remains indifferent to these facts. What is also ignored is that the agricultural crisis has been compounded by the changes in the character of farming practices. Indias search for food security and the subsequent success of the Green Revolution have resulted in the government according greater priority to the school of farming that encourages high yields. This includes features such as an indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and greater corporatization. These are preferred over the school that is characterized by diverse, sustainable and ecologically sensitive practices. The consequences of such a transformation are evident among the farmers in Kaltikuri. Five years ago, in this village, the average yield of paddy was 11 quintals per bigha. This yield required the application of, approximately, 20-25 kgs of chemical fertilizers per bigha. The cost of urea then was Rs 240, while the price of diammonium phosphate was Rs 450. Five years later, the average yield per bigha has fallen to 6 quintals. Nearly 70-75 kgs of fertilizers are being applied. Urea costs Rs 360 now, while the price for DAP has risen substantially. This makes it fairly evident that despite the substantial use of chemical fertilizers, there has been a corresponding drop in agricultural output, which is indicative of an alarming dip in soil fertility. The lack of government subsidies in fertilizers has eaten into the farmers profits. The rush to produce cash crops in the hope of quicker profit has also resulted in changes in cropping patterns. Farmers who once took pride in growing rice varieties such as doodhkamla, jhingasaal or banslagra are now cultivating high-yielding variants that require greater investments in chemical fertilizers. Perhaps the debate about the introduction of foreign direct investment in Indias agrarian sector needs to consider these specific aspects of the argument. The experience of potato farmers in Raina with contractual farming with a multinational giant has led cultivators in other areas of the district to believe that the privatization of agriculture can cure their plight. Their hopes are based on such promises as those of a ready market, an assured income, better seed quality, guidance regarding the preservation of soil fertility, and so on. But the question of farmers retaining their autonomy instead of being reduced to a collateral agency under such a contractual model must be addressed. For instance, would a farmer be able to exercise choice over the kind of crops that he wants to grow? (At present, the farmers in Raina only grow a variety of potato that is used to manufacture wedges and chips.) Would the profits be distributed equitably between the company and the farmers? Would such an output oriented model of farming end up replicating the ecological crisis that is a corollary of the farming practices that are in operation at present? Significantly, the farmers, at least the ones I met, are keen to fight back against the governments apathy in a novel manner. The villagers would elect candidates in the forthcoming panchayat elections by disregarding political lines in the hope of constituting a truly apolitical body. They believe that only this  and not the deaths of farmers would force the chief minister to intervene."
95,Prop for Bengal food processing ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120323/jsp/business/story_15285258.jsp,2012-03-23,Telegraph,"Big boost New Delhi, March 22: The food processing industry in Bengal is likely to attract an investment of over Rs 15,000 crore in the next 10 years. Assocham, in association with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), is working on a project to develop a pro-poor value chain in food processing to benefit small-time entrepreneurs in rural India. Bengal is one of the four states being adopted as a food processing cluster, and is ranked third best after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu for investments. Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala have also been adopted by Assocham along with the rural development ministry, the department of industrial policy and promotion and the commerce and industry ministry. The potential for investment in food processing in Bengal has been assessed at Rs 15,451 crore (over the next 10 years). The project aims to pilot initiatives for cluster-based development of community-based micro and small enterprises for food processing, Assocham states in the report. According to Assocham, value chain development through food processing enterprises located in rural areas could be an effective strategy to increase the income of the rural poor. It will also create the necessary condition for a stagnating agriculture sector to accelerate its growth pace to 4 per cent and help to maintain the countrys economic growth rate above 8 per cent. The project is expected to benefit 4,000-5,000 households in seven districts of Bengal, Kerala, Bihar and Jammu and Kashmir. The study states that despite having a wide raw material base, a majority of fruits and vegetables are sold fresh in the state. Seasonal gluts and consequent price fall are the common marketing problems being encountered. Bengal could be a major supplier of frozen and dehydrated fruits and vegetables, jams, jellies and other such items, a senior Assocham official said. Companies such as Ascon Agro PE & B Pvt. Ltd, a Pailan Group company, has entered into a joint venture with AFT/PB Counseil of France to set up a food processing unit at Dhaniakhali, Hooghly to produce potato flakes. There are many more companies that have either already set up base in various parts of Bengal or are planning to do so. Dabur has set up a food processing unit in North Bengal, so has Frito-Lay  a division of PepsiCo  that has set up a potato processing unit in Howrah, the official said. According to the report, foodgrain and fruit and vegetable processing have major investment potential in Bengal. The state being the largest producer of rice offers scope for investing especially in rice milling units, including the modernisation of mills, he said. At present, there are various Centre and state-sponsored schemes for the development of agriculture, horticulture and food processing industries, including the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana."

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee made this clear while replying to the debate on the governor's address in the assembly.She said the government would open six checkposts through which rice would be exported to Bangladesh legally, instead of only one such checkpost existing now. It is a far cry from the days when rise in the price of rice in the domestic market because of rice smuggling to Bangladesh was viewed with concern.Efforts were being made to increase export of rice to other states as well as to foreign countries. Earlier, a large quantity of rice used to go to Bangladesh from the state, but nowBangladesh was getting its rice from other sources, she said.No one asked, however, if a rush to export rice could create a shortage in the domestic market or hit the programme of the government to supply rice at Rs 2 a kg to tribal families in the state. She claimed that the production of paddy had increased by two million tonnes this year compared to the last.Participating in the debate, opposition leader Surjya Kanta Mishra expressed concern over the Centre's indication that it might find it difficult to continue with food subsidies.The government was also depending on a similar plan for export to ensure a remunerative price for potato growers. ""Our farmers are growing a variety of potato which has no demand outside. We are encouraging them to cultivate a variety that will have an export market,"" the CM said. She claimed that potato growers were now getting a price of Rs 6 a kg as against Rs 2.50 a kg last year.Problems of the farm sector  prices, food subsidy and suicides  dominated the verbal duel between the CM and the opposition leader. While Mishra said agriculture was in a crisis, Mamata argued suicides of farmers was nothing uncommon, that many of those committing suicides were not farmers, but paddy traders and that the Centre was responsible for withdrawal of subsidy on fertilizer.The chief minister emphasized that the government would fulfill its promise of return of land to unwilling farmers in Singur as soon as the court case was cleared. ""We are already in possession of the land,"" she pointed out. The chief minister did not agree with the opposition leader that the number of unwilling farmers had come down and the dispute was now only over 40 acres."

Sadananda Gowda, has failed to bring cheer among people of Hassan district.The government has reiterated its stand on implementing the Yettinahole water project, which people of Sakleshpur and environmentalists alike have been opposing, citing the possible damage to the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats.The project, proposed to come up at Yettinahole in Sakleshpur taluk, is aimed at providing water to Kolar, Chickballapur, Bangalore Urban, Bangalore Rural, Tumkur and Chitradurga districts. A sum of Rs. 400 crore has been earmarked for the project in the budget.OppositionPeople of Sakleshpur have been opposing the project. They had reiterated their opposition to the project at a meeting of representatives from dryland areas and Malnad region held in Hassan on March 17. People were already facing the impact of the decline in forest cover. Wild elephants often venture into villages, destroying crops and posing a threat to people's life, they had said.ShortageAlur-Sakleshpur MLA H.K Kumaraswamy told The Hindu that he was opposed to the project and had conveyed his views to the Chief Minister. Villages in Sakleshpur taluk have been facing shortage of drinking water. When we don't have sufficient water, how can we allow diversion of the river for the benefit of other districts, he questioned.Mr. Kumaraswamy alleged that the government had not fulfilled the long-pending demand for relief for potato growers who had suffered losses for four consecutive years due to blight. We had demanded waiver of farm loans taken by potato growers in the district. But the Chief Minister has not consider it at all, he said.RehabilitationThe Chief Minister has proposed to relocate families residing in forest areas to reduce the incidence of man-animal conflict. This year, the government wants to take up the project in Sakleshpur at a cost of Rs. 10 crore.A section of farmers in Sakleshpur have come forward to part with their land so that the forest area could be extended. Mr. Kumaraswamy said that so far farmers had given consent letters to part with 2,300 acres of land to increase the forest cover. But the funds earmarked for the project is meagre (Rs. 10 crore). Farmers are demanding at least Rs. 10 lakh an acre. For 2,300 acres, the government has to earmark at least Rs. 230 crore, he said.There are reports that small farmers with one or two acres of landholdings are not ready to part with it.RoadworksA sum of Rs. 75 crore has been allocated for the development of roads in Kodagu district. Mr. Kumaraswamy said he had also demanded Rs. 25 crore for the development of roads in Sakleshpur taluk. But the government did not respond to it, he said. The condition of roads in Sakleshpur is no better than that of those in Kodagu, the MLA said.Veterinary collegeThe Chief Minister has announced Rs. 60 crore for the construction of buildings for veterinary colleges in Hassan and Shimoga. Of this, Rs. 30 crore is expected to be released for the college in Hassan. The college is yet to obtain recognition from the Veterinary Council of India (VCI).With the allocation of funds, it is expected that the authorities will complete infrastructure development works so as to help the college get the VCI recognition.People of Sakleshpur and environmentalists alike have been opposing itDemand for relief for potato growers not fulfilled"

For the first time ever, the annual turnover for a microfinance scheme started by the vendors of east Delhi crossed Rs 1 crore.The turnover, calculated from April 2011 to March 2012, works out to Rs 1.13 crore. ""This is more than double the turnover for the previous year, which worked out to Rs 48 lakh,"" says Kamlesh Kumar Upadhyay of the National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI), which manages the accounts for the scheme.Most hawkers find themselves outside the purview of the regular banking system; they find it difficult to avail of loans or even open a bank account as most banks ask for a whole host of documents and identity proof that migrant workers to Delhi rarely have.And so, three years ago, a group of 60 vendors from east Delhi, all members of NASVI, decided to finance themselves and start their own bank. They pooled in their savings and started a co-operative society of their own. Today, the society, which works to micro-finance the hawkers, has 1,125 members.To open an account, each vendor must put in Rs 180, which includes shares worth Rs 100, an admission fee of Rs 50 and a Rs 30 compulsory monthly deposit. Vendors are free to deposit as much as they wish to over and above this minimum monthly amount. In return, they get a 4% yearly interest rate on their savings and they have to pay a mere 1.5% as interest on loans.Every evening, the vendors hand over their daily savings to NASVI. The process is entirely voluntary. ""Sometimes I deposit Rs 100 a day, sometimes Rs 200. It all depends on what I earn,"" says Gyan Prakash Gupta, a fruit seller at Madhu Vihar, Patparganj, who was among the group of vendos who first began the bank. ""The entire process of setting up our own co-operative society took place in my house,"" he says proudly. While he recently took a loan of Rs 75,000 for his business, he had borrowed Rs 50,000 from the society a couple of years ago, a loan which he has finished repaying.Indravati, a vendor who buys onions and potatoes from the Ghazipur market and sells them at Mandawali, saves around Rs 50 to Rs 100 a day that she deposits in the co-operative society.Santosh, a young woman from the bastis of Mandawali, borrowed money from the bank to diversify from selling vegetables to selling cosmetics.According to Bhikai Ram, a vegetable seller from Patparganj, the attractive rate of interest offered by the co-operative society is a far cry from the 10% interest rate that money lenders charges.In addition to micro loans, the cooperative society also sets aside a fund for the poor and the needy among the vendors. The society plans to gift Rs 15,000-20,000 to one of their members, Rana Devi, for her daughter's wedding."

Once the most preferred cash crop of Gujarati farmers,groundnut is back to the fields.Its cultivation area has registered a significant increase this rabi season,a trend seen almost after a decade.The trend is expected to infuse some life into the oil mills,which are struggling for survival due to severe shortage of groundnut.According to figures available from regional agricultural office,at present,groundnut sowing has been done over 1.70 lakh hectares. The area is expected to increase as sowing is still on. Last season,sowing was done over 1.13 lakh hectares.Farmers are turning back to groundnut, said Bhartiya Kishan Sangh leader Praful Senjalia,adding,In the current scenario,it is the hottest commodity and likely to remain so for a while.Saurashtra Oil Millers Association maintained there is such high demand for peanuts in domestic as well as international market that no fall in the prices is expected this year.In the domestic market,groundnut is already fetching over Rs 1,100 per 20 kg. It is good news that cultivation area has registered increase. This is need of the hour, said SOMA president Sameer Shah.Bhavnagar district has recorded maximum groundnut sowing over 33,700 hectares followed by Kutch (29,800 hectares),Jamnagar (17,900 hectares) and Junagadh (15,600 hectares).Little wonder that Bhagwanji Sisodia,a farmer from Ghanteshwar village on the outskirts of Rajkot city,is preferring groundnut over other oil seeds,like sesame. Groundnut,which has a cultivation cycle of 110 days,yield is expected to hit the market within four months. Even if there will be price reduction,it will not be drastic. We are sure that by the time groundnut will grow and hit the market,better prices will be available, said Sisodia.This is likely to bring some relief to the farmers in the state after prices of potato and onion  two major cash crops for Gujarat  crashed. Besides,trade of cotton,which fast replaced groundnut as number one crop in the state,was badly affected in the wake of sudden ban on its export thrice in the past two years.The farmers,however,regret that they do not have enough groundnut to supply in the current season when the prices have reached a record high of Rs 78,000 per tonne,nearly Rs 30,000 more than the opening season.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The tax on aerated and carbonated non-alcholic beverages will be increased from 12.5% to 20%. Cigarette smokers will have to pay more as the tax on cigarettes and raw tobacco has been enhanced to 22%.In order to discourage sale of fast food, tax on items such as pizzas, burgers, fried chicken, potato chips, etc sold under branded names, excluding cakes and pastries manufactured locally, will be increased to 20%.The government has also proposed to levy a tax at the rate of 15% on cars and SUVs above `15 lakh and above and also on two wheelers costing more than Rs 2 lakh. To encourage airlines to refuel at Goa airport, he has proposed to reduce VAT on aviation turbine fuel from the existing 22% to 12.5%To compensate the loss of revenue on account of reduction of entry fee in off-shore casinos from ` 2,000 to ` 500, the chief minister said that the licence fee of these casinos will be enhanced to `6.5 crore per annum thereby targeting `9 crore from off-shore casinos. The licence fee for land-based casinos will be increased to `2.5 crore fetching an additional income of `30 crore annually.Rationalizing luxury tax, the chief minister said services provided in beauty parlours and spas will be covered under the luxury tax at the rate of 10% on receipts.To encourage tourism during monsoon, the luxury tax would be reduced to 50% on existing rates provided hoteliers are prompt in filing their returns and paying tax on time.To mop up revenue, the government proposes to raise the entry tax on coal and coke to 2%.

102,Mamata asks farmers to look for alternative crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mamata-asks-farmers-to-look-for-alternative-crops/article3252697.ece,2012-03-28,The Hindu,"Addressing a gathering in Burdwan, a district that has been beleaguered by incidents of farmers' suicides in recent months though the State Government pegs the death toll at just one, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Tuesday that farmers should go in for growing alternative crops in some segment of their plots rather than devote them entirely to paddy cultivation.Earlier other States would purchase paddy from West Bengal, but now it is grown in many other places. As compared to paddy, the cultivation of pulses is much more profitable. There is a market for pulses, Ms. Banerjee said advising farmers to switch over to growing pulses in their fields.Ms. Banerjee also said that the varieties of potatoes grown in the State did not have a market in international trade.From next year on, we will tell you which varieties of potatoes to grow so that they are assured a market, she said.Ms. Banerjee said that production of 157 tonnes of paddy in the kharif season had surpassed all earlier records of paddy production.The earlier record for paddy in the State was 133 tonnes of paddy, she added.Contrary to claims made by the Left-backed peasant organisations that the State Government had restricted the process of procurement of paddy only from rice mills that was leading to farmers resorting to distress sales, Ms. Banerjee said that her government had increased the channels of procurement.At the function, credit worth Rs.110 crore was distributed in the form of Kisan Credit Cards to farmers. It is the first of several massive camps for the distribution of agricultural credit, she said adding that similar events will be organised in other districts as well.She urged farmers to repay the loans, given at seven per cent interest in the first year, pointing out that if they are prompt in the repayment of their loans, they will be able to avail loans at a lower rate of four per cent.Today you can avail Rs. 50,000 as loans, but in the coming days you can expand your enterprise to Rs 50 crores, she assured them."
103,Vegetable prices shoot up,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vegetable-prices-shoot-up/article3256445.ece,2012-03-29,The Hindu,"Prices of some vegetables have moved up sharply over a week and traders have blamed the phenomenon on extreme arid conditions in neighbouring Karnataka and Tamil Nadu from where bulk of the produce is imported.The price of beans moved up sharply to Rs.48 a kg in the retail market here on Wednesday while the retail price of bhindi (lady's finger) moved up to Rs.40 a kg, the two items of vegetable being the costliest in the market.Vegetable trader N.H. Shameed said that production of both beans and bhindi had been hit hard by a long dry spell in the neighbouring states, with Tamil Nadu also experiencing protracted spells of power supply disruptions.Of the 15 items selected to highlight the price trend, prices of seven were either Rs.30 a kg or more. Of them, bitter gourd, cow pea, banana (nendran), brinjal, tomato and cabbage stand out for their sharp appreciation in the last month.Data from Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam showed that price of beans swung sharply from Rs.16 a kg on March 28, 2011 and from the level of Rs.36 a kg a month ago to the current retail level.Similarly, price of bhindi had also moved up significantly between last year and now. The price of the produce was Rs.42 a kg last month.Prices of items of daily use like onions, big and small; potatoes and green chilli continue to hold firm while there has been a significant fall in the price of drumsticks. Drumsticks are selling at Rs.18 a kg, down from the Rs.80 a kg at the end of last month. Mr. Shameed said that there was a general shortage of vegetable supplies to the city. Against the normal arrivals of nearly 25 loads daily, supplies had shrunk to less than 20 loads a day. Dry weather conditions had resulted in a drop in production ranging between 30 and 40 per cent in some of the vegetable growing areas of Tamil Nadu, he said.A shortage of production and fall in productivity apart, there was also great demand for vegetables in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka from exporters, who were procuring large quantities for foreign markets."
104,World Tobacco Atlas rings alarm bells for India,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/World-Tobacco-Atlas-rings-alarm-bells-for-India/articleshow/12448418.cms,2012-03-29,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Expanse of tobacco cultivation in India is large enough to house over 4.81 lakh soccer fields.On a day when a Lancet study said tobacco-related cancers in India caused 1.2 lakh deaths in 2010, and were responsible for over 40% of male and nearly 20% of female cancers, a new Tobacco Atlas brought out by the World Lung Foundation says over 390,000 hectares are being used in India to grow tobacco.Tobacco is grown in 124 countries, occupying 3.8 million hectares of agricultural land.The Atlas says each hectare of land devoted to tobacco produced one tonne of tobacco leaf, while a similar size of plot growing potatoes had a yield of 14.6 tonnes in the same year.The Atlas pegs India's direct healthcare costs due to tobacco at $1,195 million.The Planning Commission says that revenue collected from tobacco products annually in India is $1.62 billion (largely coming from taxation of cigarettes), while the annual direct health cost of three tobacco- related diseases (cancer, coronary artery diseases and chronic obstructive lung diseases) is $6.32 billion.World tobacco production peaked in 1997 at over 9 million tonnes, and has since declined by almost a quarter to 7.1 million tonnes in 2009.Worryingly, 20,000 hectares of forests across the globe annually are being cleared to cure tobacco. In 2009, six of the 10 tobacco producing countries, including India, had undernourishment rates between 5% and 27%.Hriday, a Delhi-based NGO, says growing tobacco impacts the environment negatively. It says India is the third largest producer of tobacco in the world, having 436,000 hectares under cultivation.Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh account for over 90% of the total tobacco production in the country. There is a global evidence of deforestation linked to tobacco production. Deforestation mainly occurs in the developing world, amounting to 1.7% of the global net losses of forest cover or, on an average, 4.6% of the total national deforestation in countries where tobacco is cultivated.About half of the tobacco leaves produced in developing countries in Africa and Asia are cured (dried out for cigarette production) with wood. An average of 7.8 kg of wood is needed to cure 1 kg of tobacco. The Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal estimated that the historical use of fuel wood between 1962 and 2002, for tobacco curing and manufacture of cigarettes, has destroyed and degraded 680 sq km of scrub forests, or nearly 868 million tonnes of wood through successive extraction.Tobacco is a sensitive plant prone to many diseases, especially during early growth. It requires huge chemical inputs: up to 16 applications of pesticide are recommended during a three-month growing period. DDT is among the chemicals used.Methyl bromide, widely used as a fumigant in developing countries, contributes substantially to ozone depletion and is a toxic contaminant of groundwater.Cigarette butts are among the most common forms of litter. Worldwide, approximately 4.95 trillion cigarette butts are estimated to be littered each year. Cigarette butts contain all carcinogenic chemicals, pesticides, and nicotine.The Lancet also said there were twice as many deaths from oral cancers as lung cancers, in part due to common use of chewing tobacco in men and women.The number of oral cancers was more than twice the number of lung cancers in individuals between 30 and 69 years, indicating that the range of fatal cancers caused by tobacco in India differs substantially from that in high-income countries.The Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) estimates there are 10 distinct tobacco types grown in 15 states of the country. In India, the tobacco crop directly or indirectly supports 36 million people engaged in production, processing, marketing and exports which includes six million farmers and 5 million people involved in bidi-rolling and tendu leaf-plucking.Highlights* More than one-third of adults (35%) use tobacco in India, or 274.9 million* 163.7 million use only smokeless tobacco; 68.9 million are only smokers and 42.3 million users of both smoking and smokeless tobacco.* 14.1% children in the age group of 13-15 years are consuming tobacco in some form* Bidis, along with smokeless tobacco, account for 81% of the Indian tobacco market.* India is also the second largest consumer and second largest producer of tobacco in the world, second only to China.* The prevalence of overall tobacco use among males is 48% and among females is 20%.* Nearly two in five adults (38%) in rural areas and one in four adults (25%) in urban areas use tobacco in some form* The extent of use of smokeless tobacco products among males (33%) is higher than among females (18%)* Globally 6 million people die each year due tobacco consumption-related diseases* The death toll is estimated to rise to eight million by 2030.* It is estimated that more than 80% of these deaths occur in the developing countries.* Tobacco has also been identified as the risk factor for 6 of the 8 leading causes of death.* Nearly 30% of cancers in males in India, and more than 80% of all oral cancer are related to tobacco use."

When contacted, FMC chairman Ramesh Abhishek confirmed the development and said that exchanges have also been asked to be on guard and iniate steps but refused to elaborate further.The regulatory agency is expected to crack down on speculators over the next few days, which will include moves such as clubbing of client positions to track related-party activity. ""We did this in case of guar seeds where we noticed speculative behaviour,"" said a source.NCDEX has also been asked to stop guar trading. In addition, position limits and cash margins are being enhanced to check speculation. The main focus seems to be on farm products where significant price increase has been noticed in the last six months.The steps come at a time when the government is under pressure on a series of scandals and the regulator, which is at present a part of the consumer affairs ministry, wants to avoid another row, especially one concerning food items. UPA II has spent more than half its term so far trying to douse the inflation fire, which just seems to have come under control.With moves such as a check on client code modification to check speculation, FMC has initiated steps to make market behaviour more orderly. Source said the consumer affairs ministry too has got into the act and is pushing for amendments to the Forwards Contracts (Regulation) Act to make the regulator an independed entity with powers to levy penalty and also provide manpower for better surveillance."

It may be noted that prices of vegetables shot up like anything last year too.State agricultural marketing minister Arup Roy held a meeting with the task force, formed last year when prices of vegetables, including potatoes, were soaring.Roy claimed that the farmers have, so far, got good price for potatoes this year. ""They had sold potatoes at Rs 8 in the field, so it is not unusual for the price in markets to reach Rs 12-15,"" he said. But sellers in the markets warned that the prices might zoom past Rs 20 or more in a couple of weeks.But Roy rubbished the speculation. He said officials were keeping a check on the market so that the middlemen can't influence prices this doesn't rise further and middlemen don't influence prices. ""District magistrates and agricultural marketing officials have been asked to keep a tab. We will not allow middlemen to enter the supply chain,"" Roy said.Potato production has been less this year compared to 2011, though it is still much more than the state's total consumption. This year, there are reports of 80 to 85 lakh metric tonnes of potato production in the state, whereas the consumption was 60 lakh metric tonne last year. There is over production of potatoes every year, the reason why farmers lose out on being unable to sell their entire produce.But whether the state government is able to keep a check on the prices on check after farmers get the right price for their produce, it will be evident in a couple of weeks' time."

Similarly, field bean (avarai) and a few other English vegetables were available only at high prices. Onion (Rs. 10-12) and potato (Rs. 14-16) were, however, being sold at the usual price but for marginal fluctuation. Interestingly, the price of drumstick was at Rs 1.50 and Rs 2 a piece, which was pretty low as the commodity was selling at Rs. 4 and even Rs. 5 a few weeks ago. As for the rates of fruits like apple, farmers at the uzhavar sandhais in the city said that due to less arrival than the usual volume, the price was up by 30 per cent. However, water melon was available at Rs. 8 -10 per piece. A vegetable vendor at the wholesale vegetable market attributed the sudden rise in price of English vegetables to bulk purchase made by private persons in rural pockets. Temple festivals are being organised in many hamlets and for this purpose, organisers purchase vegetables in bulk. Moreover, tomorrow being Panguni uthiram,' more feasts are being organised, the vendors maintained. In fact, prices of a few more vegetables including tomatoes are likely to go up in the next couple of days, they added.Officials at the Agricultural Marketing Committee and uzhavar sandhais' said that the sudden rise in the vegetable price would not last long and normal rates would prevail soon. However, they apprehended shrinking of cultivable area of vegetables due to the onset of summer."

A 20 per cent fall in potato production in Uttar Pradesh  the largest potato producing state  encouraged online potato traders,who are buying potato bonds from Bengal and selling them to UP and other states.State agriculture marketing minister Arup Roy said Bengals potato production during December-March dropped by 15 per cent.We have reports that potatoes worth more than Rs 300 crore were sold online to other states, Roy told The Indian Express. However,he claimed that the resultant hike in prices was marginal and not alarming.This time last year,people purchased potatoes at Rs 6 per kg and farmers had to sell under distress conditions because of middlemen. This time,the menace was checked by task force committee members, Roy said.The minister said prices in retail markets were lower than that last year. Potatoes are sold in the fields at Rs 8 per kg. The farmers therefore are getting the right price. Potatoes are sold in the retail market at Rs 12 per kg. This is because of increasing transport cost and not due to middlemen.This year overall potato production of the country dropped because of soaring prices of fertilizers and pesticides. Because of this shortfall,potato bonds are being purchased online by traders of the other states, said Swapan Samanta,a potato trader and functionary of Trinamool-controlled Tarakeswar municipality.

110,‘P’ for potato and pocket pinch,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120406/jsp/odisha/story_15339969.jsp,2012-04-06,Telegraph,"Cuttack/Bhubaneswar, April 5: The potato in your alu bonda or French fries will cost you dear. Prices of this favourite tuber have hit the roof, leaping from Rs 8 a week ago to Rs 14 a kilogram in the twin cities. Wholesale prices have touched Rs 1,200 per quintal this year at Chhatra Bazaar, one of the largest vegetable markets in the state. The Chhatra Bazaar Byabasayi Sangha spokesperson said eight to 10 truckloads (each carrying 100 quintals) were reaching the market every day with an average procurement rate ranging between Rs 1,050 and Rs 1,100 per quintal. The better quality potatoes cost Rs 1,100 per quintal. Potato prices have been ascending heavenward over the past three months. In January, wholesale prices at Chhatra Bazaar ranged from Rs 800 to Rs 850 per quintal. In February, prices were in the range of Rs 850 to 900 per quintal with the same amount of arrivals. The price went further northward in the range of Rs 950 to Rs 1,000 in March. Arrivals were steady, with eight to 10 trucks coming in every day. The rise in retail prices is said to be mainly on account of lack of local supply and deficient storage facilities in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. Not surprisingly, common people are at the receiving end. Potato prices have almost doubled in the past three months. A kilogram was available for Rs 6 to Rs 7 in December last year, but now they cost Rs 14 a kilo, said Suvenka Das, a homemaker at Sutahat. My daily vegetable budget has gone haywire because of the steady rise in prices of potatoes, which has a major share in the family menu, said Anurupa Rao, a homemaker from Mehendipir. Bhubaneswar homemaker Rashmiprabha Parida said: Potato prices have hit us all. The children are particularly fond of dishes made of potato. General secretary, Unit I Market Traders Association, Gayadhar Swain blamed it on low production and poor storage facilities. The low production of potatoes in Odisha is the main problem. Last year there was bumper crop but farmers had to sell the stocks cheap because of lack of cold storage or bad management, he said. Sources said the state consumes more than 5 lakh tonnes of potato a year. The annual production from the state was in the range of 1.75 to 1.8 lakh tonnes, while the rest came from Bengal.Chhatra Bazaar Byabasayi Sangha secretary Debendra Sahu said: We have very little to do with the rising prices, as procurement cost is going up because of increase in prices at the source end. Chhatra Bazaar handles over four lakh quintals of potatoes per annum. Arrivals under normal circumstances range from eight to 10 trucks a day and during glut, go up to 16 trucks (each carrying 100 quintals). As there is almost no potato production in the state, the vegetable mandi is dependent on Bengal for the cash crop. Prices of potato in Bengal have been on an upward curve. Consequently, prices of potato stocks reaching here are being offered at higher rates. Besides, the overall potato production in the country has dropped this year, Sahu said. The situation is likely to improve if arrival of potato increases with supply, which is expected to increase in the next two weeks after the cold storages in Bengal start releasing the vegetable, he said. I was selling potato for Rs 13 per kilo yesterday. But we were forced to sell it at Rs 14 per kilo today because we are buying it at Rs 12 per kilo now, said a vegetable seller at Cantonment Road."
111,Exotic vegetables a hit at Ahmedabad Kisan Bazar,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/exotic-vegetables-a-hit-at-ahmedabad-kisan-bazar/,2012-04-07,Indian Express,"Kisan Bazar,inaugurated by state Agriculture Minister Dileep Sanghani amid much fanfare here a month ago,sells a good number of exotic vegetables,but customers complain of lack of variety in the staple category.Visits to the Bazar,on the Drive-in-Road,over the last few days revealed that almost 30 per cent of all the vegetables sold here are exotic and there are customers too for it despite the fact that these are costlier,almost double the price of the staple varieties.People are ready to pay for it, said Jay Patel from Visnagar,who had brought more than 100 kg of strawberry tomatoes,which are of the size of strawberries and sour in taste like strawberries.Priced at Rs 50 per kg,Patel had a beeline of customers for his exotic tomatoes on Friday afternoon and it was sold within an hour.One of the customers Minal Patel said her children liked it and it was not always available and hence,she was buying it.Other exotic varieties,which are also described as Chinese vegetables by the locals for their peculiar look,included broccoli,purple cabbage,and red and yellow capsicum supplied by farmers from Prantij in neighbouring Sabarkantha district.A farmer from Bhavnagar had come with a variety of potato which he called sugar-free potatoes as he claimed it was less sweeter than the regular potatoes with high percentage of carbohydrate sold in the market.Though the prices of both the exotic and the staple varieties here are 30 to 50 per cent lower than that in other vegetable markets in the city and all the commodities are also comparatively fresh,many customers complained that the Bazar lacked variety in the staple category.Madhu Patel,a housewife,said the vegetables here were fresh and good but only some varieties were available. Supposing if green chillies are not available,then the customer will have to go to another market,which will be very inconvenient. The next time the customer will think several times before coming to this market, she said.While Harshad Patel,retired government officer,made similar complaints,T M Parikh,who lives in the Satellite Flats,felt the idea of KB was very good but it lacked proper management.The authorities behind launching the KB must ensure that all the varieties are available like in any other vegetable market, said Parikh,an engineer having spent several years in the US. Otherwise,it will not succeed, he added.Interestingly,many farmers selling their produce here categorically stated that they were not interested in retail sale in Ahmedabad as it was not profitable to them. This is despite the fact that they have been provided stalls with facilities like free power supply for two months.The reason: all these farmers come from places like Prantij and Modasa in Sabarkantha,Visnagar in Mehsana district and villages in Dascroi taluka of Ahmedabad,35 to 100 kms away.They say it is not profitable to them because they have to bear the transportation expenses and also spend the whole day at KB at the cost of their farming.This explains why all the 29 stalls set up at KB had not been occupied by the farmers. There were only 10 stalls operating on Friday and 18 on Thursday.At the end,farmers dont gain anything, said a farmer.Another farmer said that he had been coming to the market for the last three days because he was forced by the district agriculture authorities.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
112,'Cruellest' month for food prices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Cruellest-month-for-food-prices/articleshow/12576756.cms,2012-04-08,The Times Of India,"TS Eliot's description of April as the cruellest month rings true for Mumbaikars this season. The beginning of the new financial year has brought a further tightening of the belt as far as food prices are concerned. Coupled with the raised cost of milk, vegetables and cooking oil, the budgetary increase in service tax from 10% to 12% is draining the money purse with every purchase as is the additional cost of transportation.On April 1, cattleshed owners increased the price of buffalo milk by Rs 3, bringing it to Rs 52 per litre, and promptly , big companies followed suit by hiking the rates of all brands with no immediate trigger but competition.Riding the back of a summer shortage, tomato has come to cost Rs 24-32 per kg in retail markets, up from Rs 10-12 , while potato, another staple, became a talking point nationwide as it touched Rs 16-17 per kg, two to five rupees more than average. Cooking oil rises by Rs 6-8 to a litre every few weeks. These cumulative costs are bearing down on the middle-class consumer.Moinuddin Ghaswala , who owns a dairy farm in Jogeshwari , says it was the spiralling cost of milch animals , cattlefeed and transportation that forced him to raise milk prices from Rs 48 to Rs 52. ""Byproducts like paneer and mawa have all gone up by 20% since April 1,"" he said. ""Over the past few months, cattlefeed that is derived from cottonseed oil has come to cost Rs 15,000 per tonne versus Rs 8,000. A mediocre buffalo from Gujarat sells at Rs 80,000 over Rs 60,000 while the premium variety from Haryana and NCR costs nothing less than Rs 1.20 lakh. If I am to transport it to Mumbai, I must pay much more by way of transport than I did merely two weeks ago. How can I explain all this to my customers?""Vendors point out that heavy weights and measures lie unutilized for most part of the day. Families that would purchase up to one kilogram of vegetables now settle for a quarter or a half kg. ""In a stark irony, the rising cost of common vegetables like beans and lady finger has pushed consumers towards the humble potato - and now the prices of this root have risen owing to unprecedented demand. Moreover , wastage and spoilage of perishables tend to increase during summer so retail costs rise proportionately ,"" says Dilip Kumar Gupta , a vegetable seller from Bandra. Customers at Pali market have been paying Rs 32 for a single kilogram of tomato where it should cost Rs 12.Typically, housewives find they are forced to repeat tasteless fare like cabbage on the menu, interpersed with cauliflower, for these are the two items that serve a household at Rs 20-30 per kg. Says Girgaum resident Anjana Shastri, ""The government wants to add to our burden by increasing taxes and the price ofLPG instead of addressing the issue of price rise."" Orlem resident Sheryl D'Souza , whose double-income family has seen savings drop by half, says, ""Annual increments will likely be channelized towards household expenses more than ever before, given that taxi fares rose recently and bus fares are set to rise."""

The price of potatoes soared from Rs 8-9 to Rs 12-15 last week hitting the common man below the belt.Food supplies and consumer welfare secretary Madhusudan Padhi said, ""We are keeping an eye on the market. This is a temporary rise and things have started improving in the last couple of days. All district collectors and food and supply authorities have been asked to stop speculative pricing by wholesalers' and retailers."" Padhi, however, denied any plan by the government to invoke ESMA (Essential Services Maintenance Act).Padhi said officers' have been asked to check hoarding by conducting raids and prevent middlemen from influencing prices. ""We are also requesting the consumers not get panicky resulting in bulk buying, which will worsen the situation. The price of potato has reduced by Rs 100 to Rs 150 per quintal in the last couple of days,"" he added.However, market insiders are not ready to buy the story. ""The price of potato has not increased in Odisha only rather it has soared across the country. So it is not possible to check price rise here,"" said Pradip Sahu, a wholesaler in Unit-I market. Orissa imports potato from West Bengal, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh.Even the prices of ""parval, kankoda"", brinjal, bitter gourd, lady's finger and tomatoes have nearly doubled in the past one week. Barely a week ago, brinjal was Rs 10 a kg. Now it is selling for Rs 20 to Rs 24 a kg. Parval and lady's finger are sold between Rs 40 and Rs 45 a kg. Similarly bitter gourd is selling for Rs 30 a kg, carrot Rs 30 a kg, coriander leaves Rs 60, cauliflower Rs 20 to Rs 25 a piece and green chillies Rs 60 a kg, tomato Rs 28 a kg and green banana Rs 40 a dozen.""The only solace is that the price of onion is constant between Rs 10 and 12. The price rise is affecting the household budget,"" said Paramita Nanda, a housewife."

Although the suppliers are procuring vegetables from far off places, including Kolhapur and Belgaum, the rise in transportation cost has also pushed up the prices further.Reduction in land under agriculture due to the increasing urbanization in areas like Pirangut, Paud, Rajgurunagar, Junnar, Wagholi, Ranjangaon, Shirwal, Khed Shivapur, Nanded Phata and Donje has also affected the vegetable prices. Earlier, these were the major pockets that grew vegetables to meet Pune's needs.Vilas Bhujbal, former chairman of the agriculture produce market committee (APMC), said: ""There was hardly any rain in November last year. It has adversely affected water availability in rural areas and this shortage of water is affecting production. Areas closer to Pune, like Satara and Ahmednagar, have less water availability. Availability at Kolhapur and Belgaum is better, but transportation costs increase when vegetables are sourced from these areas and hence prices go up.""Though the prices are only slightly higher compared to that in the same period previous year, compared to January this year, the average rise in vegetable prices is of Rs 10 per kg. The key markets in the city, from Peth areas to upmarket areas, have shown rise in prices.For instance, cabbage was sold at Rs 20 per kg this January, but it is now priced at Rs 50 per kg. However, a vendor at Deccan Gymkhana was selling cabbage for Rs 15 per 250 gm (Rs 60 per kg). He said, ""Vegetables like cabbage and cauliflower have to be cut if customer wants to buy less than 1 kg; hence we charge extra as the rest of the vegetable may go waste if there are no buyers."" The prices are expected to remain on the higher side for the next couple of weeks. They may come down if surrounding areas of the city receive pre-monsoon showers in May, which could benefit farmers, he said.Sumati Joshi, a resident of Kodhrud said, ""The prices of cabbage, lady finger and potato were hovering around Rs 30 per kg in January. Today, the prices of almost all vegetables are touching Rs 50 per kg. When prices are up, the supply goes up within three-four days and prices come down. But, I cannot wait for that to happen every time.""Meanwhile, the prices apple, grapes and papaya are slightly lower compared to the corresponding period previous year. Now, apples and grapes are sold at Rs 70 and Rs 40 per kg respectively, while the same were priced at Rs 100 and Rs 60 per kg on April 10, 2011. Papaya was sold at Rs 14 per kg in the first week of April 2011, while the current price is Rs 10 per kg.The price fluctuation is more visible in fruits as fruit is a seasonal commodity unlike vegetables."

The monotonous menus are all set for a makeover with healthy and delicious alternatives like tomato rice, groundnut pulao and vegetable biryani to be prepared by noon meal workers.The initiative to tweak noon meal menus with imagination, nutrition and variation was introduced by the district administration through a training programme by Chef Dhamu for noon meal workers from 25 centres on Tuesday.While smells of roast spices wafting in the air and shrill whistles of a pressure cooker may have indicated a kitchen setting, the cooking demonstration by the celebrity chef was actually in the middle of the playground at a government school in Allur near Tiruchi.The obvious question is whether it is possible to prepare these dishes with the provisions allotted under the scheme and stick to the budget, said District Collector Jayshree Muridharan who kick-started the pilot project. No extra ingredients have been bought. These dishes can be prepared with whatever grains and vegetables provided everyday.As an experiment, noon meal workers prepared Tuesday's staple menu of sambar rice, boiled egg and groundnut sundal for 100 students. But Chef Dhamu , using the same ingredients turned out groundnut pulao, roasted potatoes and tossed eggs in a mixture of pepper and coriander powder.Not all that is served everyday is consumed by students. But it was heartening to see children polishing their plates, said Ms.Muralidharan. She motivated noon meal workers, You must take pride in your work, as you don the role of mothers by preparing hot food for scores of children.The women trained in the pilot programme would train workers from other centres during the summer vacation.I have seen students play ball with hard boiled eggs made in noon meal centres. For children to eat well, we need to cook well, Mr.Dhamu told workers demonstrating how a dash of pepper or a smatter of chilli powder can spice up a meal.Avoid food poisoningMany of the workers were thrilled at receiving practical hints in offsetting excesses in salt, chilli powder and tamarind.Insisting that safety and hygiene were paramount, he suggested, If you wash all vegetables with water, turmeric and salt, you can rule out all chances of food poisoning, said Mr.Dhamu. Though cleaning utensils, keeping cooking range spick and span, and covering all chopped vegetables were important, preparing and serving food with love was foremost, he said.While Rs.14 is allotted per child covering firewood, oil , rice , centres are granted 70 paise per head to purchase vegetables and condiments. M.Uma, a worker from Kuriviyan kulam said, It might be difficult to make all these dishes owing to escalating prices of daily provisions, but we can definitely provide students more variety in their mid-day meal."

Vegetable prices have shot up two-fold in the last couple of days. Beans and ladies finger are the most expensive in the market, at Rs.80 and Rs.60 a kg respectively. Brinjal costs Rs.40 a kg. while tomato, snake gourd and elephant foot yam are priced at Rs.30 a kg. Cucumber and banana cost Rs.25 while bottle gourds and broom sticks come at Rs.20 a kg. The common man may find it wiser to celebrate Vishu this year with a simple sambar of potatoes and onions costing Rs.15 and Rs.10 a kg. respectively.However, the costs vary from vendor to vendor. A vendor was seen selling lemon at Rs.40 a kg., announcing that this was the lowest price. Kani vellari , golden cucumber that is an indispensable part of the Vishu Kani', costs anything between Rs.20 and Rs.40 a piece (not kilogram) depending on the vendor. Drought in Tamil Nadu, the major source of vegetables for the State, and demand of higher rent by lorry owners are the reasons for the higher prices, a vendor said.Roadside cloth vendors around Mananchira, Pavamani Road, S.M. Street and Moideen Palli Road are, however, are a big draw, mainly owing to lower prices of their wares. The bigger shops have announced special discounts and freebies for Vishu to attract seasonal customers. Home appliances, footwear and electronics shops too have offered discounts.The firecracker market is lively as usual. Cracker shops, mainly in Valiyangadi, Puthiyangadi and West Hill, are abuzz with customers, especially children. Novel Chinese' firecrackers are more in demand as they offer a better spectacle with very little noise. The traditional sparklers now come in cylindrical tubes instead of rectangular packets. The other popular varieties include Jumping Frog', Bubbles', Mini fountain', Jasmine Drop' Magic Whip', Divya Jyoti' and Blue Inspire'. Praveen Kumar, a cracker vendor, said the prices of firecrackers of the same variety are different for different brands. The traditional palm leaf crackers have been banned this year as they have proved dangerous in the previous years. Liquor sales have, however, not been affected by price rise. Serpentine queues were seen outside the Kerala State Beverages Corporation outlets."

In March last year, it was 9.68 per cent.As per the official data released on Monday, inflation in food items was 9.94 per cent in March, as against 6.07 per cent in February.Onion prices declined by 24.23 per cent in March. The rate of decline was 48.50 per cent in February.

120,Price blow to consumers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120416/jsp/odisha/story_15377096.jsp,2012-04-16,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar/Cuttack, April 15: Vegetable prices have gone up over the past week inconveniencing consumers. The price of seasonal vegetables such as pointed gourd and cucumber is hovering between Rs 30 and Rs 35 in various vegetable markets of the capital city and the price of potato has touched Rs 14. The expensive vegetables have gone out of reach of the common people, said Sarita Pradhan, a homemaker. The price of brinjal and ladys finger is hovering around Rs 25 a kg while drumsticks cost Rs 50, up from Rs 30 a week ago. With the rise in prices of potato and other vegetables, it has become very difficult to manage the family budget, said Kavita Biswal, another homemaker. Although the city depends on states such as Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh for vegetables including pointed gourd, potato, onion, cabbage and cauliflower, vegetables are also grown locally at Pipili and other parts of Khurda. Thunder squalls on Wednesday night damaged vegetables grown locally. Lack of proper irrigation facilities, coupled with frequent natural calamities, have taken a toll on vegetable production. To meet the demand, we have to import vegetables from the neighbouring states and hence, the price goes up, said general secretary of Rajdhani Dainik Haat Byabasayi Mahasangha Gayadhar Swain, adding that the prices could go up further. The silver lining is that the price of green mangoes have decreased from Rs 30 to Rs 15 a kg following the storms. The situation is the same in Cuttack and prices of vegetables have increased by almost 10 to 15 per cent from last week. The price of potato is between Rs 13 and Rs 15 a kg as compared to Rs 8 to Rs 10 last week. The prices of tomato, pointed gourd, brinjal, bitter gourd, ladys finger and tomatoes have doubled in the past week. Brinjal, which was being sold at Rs 10 to 15 a kg last week, is now available at Rs 20 to 25. Pointed gourd and ladys finger are being sold between Rs 40 and Rs 45 a kg. Bitter gourd is selling for Rs 25 to 30 and tomato for Rs 25 to 30 a kg. I am now forced to spend at least Rs 140 a week to buy vegetables for myself. Earlier, I used to spend not more than Rs 100, said M.F. Alam, 33, a resident of Gandarpur. Traders at Chatra Bazar, the wholesale vegetable market, said prices had gone up over the last two weeks because of the lack of local production and extra transportation cost. We are helpless as the bulk of vegetables, including potatoes, are being brought from Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Maharastra, said Ramakant Prusty, a vegetable trader. Vegetable sellers said the price hike was because of a decline in the local production and inadequate supply of vegetables from the neighbouring states. Besides, lack of adequate cold storage facilities is also to be blamed for rise in the prices of vegetables. It is particularly during monsoon and summer that the prices of vegetables go up every year. This is mainly because the local traders want to hoard vegetables, said Basant Moharana, a resident of Jhanjirmangala."

That's because while retail prices have soared by Rs 5 to 10 per kg in the past month, mandi officials say there has been no comparable rise in wholesale rates.Not for the first time, say wholesale market officials, retailers are driving the rise in veggie prices. ""In the wholesale market, some items like green winter vegetables are slightly more expensive at present but the difference in rates is marginal. This apart, prices have been more or less stable in the past month or so. But there is no control over retailers,"" said an Azadpur mandi official. He said while seasonal changes in prices of onions and tomatoes are normal, the retail rates are no indication of the current wholesale prices.Shilpa Singh, a resident of east Delhi's Gagan Vihar, said vegetable vendors have been citing shortage to increase prices. ""In the past month, everything has become expensive by Rs 5 to 10. Tomatoes became more expensive at the start of this month and prices haven't fallen till now. From Rs 15 in beginning March, tomatoes are now selling for no less than Rs 20,"" she said.At the beginning of April, tomato prices saw a sudden hike as there was a shortfall in the crop coming from Rajasthan and Haryana. The city brought in good-quality tomatoes from Gujarat which cost more. But though wholesale rates have gone up, the rise in retails prices has been sharper.Akhila Yadav, a resident of Maujpur said she bought tomatoes for Rs 40 per kg on Tuesday. ""Each vegetable shopping trip sets me back by at least Rs 300. It is not just tomatoes that are so expensive. Even onions are Rs 25 per kg here,"" she said.The rise in potato prices is even more baffling. The vegetable was selling for Rs 10-15 per kg in December-end but now is Rs 5 costlier on an average although the mandi rates remain unchanged.Since December, lady's finger prices have gone up from Rs 60 per kg to Rs 100. In addition, there is a wide variation in rates within the city. In GK-II markets, lady's finger is available for Rs 100 per kg while in east Delhi one can buy the vegetable of good quality for Rs 80 per kg. Beans are available for Rs 80 per kg in Patel Nagar, Rs 48 per kg in east Delhi's Shakarpur and Rs 40 in Gagan Vihar. Residents of all these areas say the quality of the vegetable is good.""Prices of all vegetable are so high. We understand that unseasonal vegetables will be expensive but how can the price difference be so steep? Most vegetables are now being kept in cold storage so they are available all through the year. Why then is there this sudden hike?"" asked Vineeta Singh, a resident of south Delhi's Gulmohar Park."

In the past one week, the price of the kitchen essential has increased by 50 per cent in Ranchi, triggering a tumble in household budgets with no supply of local variants and businessmen claiming that other potato-surplus states were stockpiling the tuberous crop. At retail markets such as Lalpur, Kantatoli, Ratu Road, Doranda, Ashok Nagar and others, potatoes that once sold at Rs 7-8 per kg now sell for Rs 10-12 per kg. We get potatoes at Rs 500 per 50kg bag. You add transportation cost and our profit margin, and you will get a price of Rs 12 per kg. Even a week ago, we got potatoes at around Rs 380 per 50kg bag, which is why we could sell at less than Rs 10 per kg, said vendor Sukumar Prasad at Lalpur retail market. Jharkhand produces around 6,55,000 tonnes of potatoes per annum, less than 25 per cent of what the three crore residents of the state consume in the same tenure. The state satisfies the bulk of its potato craving from imports from north India and Bengal. Ranchi has two wholesale potato markets  Daily Market on Mahatma Gandhi Road (popularly known as Main Road) and Pandra Bazar  from where retailers procure potatoes for smaller markets. A week ago, we got potato supply from the local Jharkhand producers. But the local potato stock is now nearly over. We have to import supply from Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam. Farmers in these states are themselves selling potatoes at a high price of around Rs 7-8 per kg. How can we sell at Rs 10 per kg? said Md Mustafa, a wholesale potato dealer who runs his business from Daily Market. However, Sajjan Saraf, president of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries, hinted there was more than what met the eye. Somewhere, hoarding may be going on, which is behi nd the price spiralling northward. The Centre should take concrete steps if potato prices soar in other states too, said Saraf. Wholesalers, however, blamed the weather and said the potato harvest had taken a beating in Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Punjab, Haryana and others. We know that farmers are selling at a high rate this year. There are fewer potatoes to sell, said Mustafa. They added that there would be no lid on potato prices in the coming months. They may cross the Rs 17-18 per kg benchmark of October 2009 as well. Prices of this much-loved tuber had shot up to an all-time high in October 2009. But after this, prices stayed stable around Rs 7-12 per kg. During December-January this year, when the market was flooded with local potatoes, the price stayed below Rs 8 per kg.

I do hope in course of time it will moderate  we shall have to be alert on it ... Of course, the supply side constraint substantially affect food inflation. We will be addressing that.Positive aspectsHowever, there are a couple of positive aspects that can be culled out of the March inflation data. One, that overall inflation at 6.89 per cent for March, 2012, is way lower than the 9.68 per cent pegged for the same month a year ago. And two, inflation in the manufactured goods sector at 4.87 per cent during the month signals a declining trend from 5.75 per cent in February and much below the March, 2011, level of 7.45 per cent although this could partly be attributed to as effect of a high base.LiquidityBe that as it may, considering that overall remains sticky owing to high food prices which has to be addressed through supply-side measures and the Finance Minister, in his budget speech for 2012-13, has already indicated the dire need of hiking fuel prices during the year for purposes of fiscal consolidation, the Reserve Bank may deem it fit to meet the widespread expectation of a marginal easing in interest rates along with a reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) so as to provide a comfortable liquidity situation.Holding this view, ICRA economist Aditi Nayar said that despite concerns related to suppressed inflation and elevated global crude oil prices, the RBI is likely to reduce the repo rate and CRR by 25 basis points each in its annual monetary policy review on Tuesday.Presenting a counter to this is KASSA Group Director Siddharth Shankar, who feels that food inflation is here to stay in the coming months and with the rupee depreciating, non-food articles inflation will continue to see an upward move. I feel that RBI should not cut the interest rates  The macro economic factors still do not favour a rate cut, he said.As per the official data, inflation in food articles, which has a 14.3 per cent share in the WPI basket, rose sharply to 9.94 per cent in March from 6.07 per cent in February, especially owing to vegetable prices shooting up by 30.57 per cent during the month.While milk prices went up by 15.29 per cent, rice and cereals turned dearer by 4.73 per cent and 4.41 per cent, respectively and potatoes were costlier by 11.60 per cent. Protein-rich items such as eggs, meat and fish were more expensive by 17.71 per cent year-on-year."

The government has declared as many as 146 taluks in the state as drought hit.A five-point agenda has been set for discussion in the meeting. The agenda includes submitting a memorandum to the Centre seeking more funds and resolving the Cauvery water row with the Tamil Nadu which is demanding its share of water despite drought in the State, said official sources.Minimum support priceAccording special status to the Hyderabad-Karnataka region, under Article 371, extending minimum support price to pomegranate, potato and arecanut crops and increasing the import duty on silk also form part of the agenda for discussion.The possibility of waiving of crop loans will be an important issue to be discussed at the meeting. An all-party delegation led by Chief Minister D V Sadananda Gowda to Delhi to submit a memorandum on crop loan waiver, too, is in the offing.The State government has released Rs 339 crore towards drought relief, in addition to reserving Rs 250 crore to address shortage of drinking water. Reports on drought in the State prepared by three teams, each headed by a senior minister, will be reviewed at the meeting, the sources said.Senior leaders of both the Congress and the JD(S) who had toured drought-hit areas are likely to counter the claims of the government at the meeting, based on their own independent findings.Farm loan waiverG Parameshwara, KPCC president, has announced that they will demand the waiver of farm loans in taluks severely hit by drought, during the all-party meet called by Chief Minister D V Sadananda Gowda on April 19 (Thursday).He was speaking to reporters after a visit to Manchegowdanakoppal, Anandur, Naganahalli and other villages in Mysore taluk on Wednesday.As many as 18 lakh farmers have availed loans to the tune of nearly Rs 6,000 crore from co-operative banks. With drought prevailing in 123 taluks, the government should write off loans taken by farmers and the demand for this will be placed at the all-party meeting, the State Congress chief said.Parameshwara welcomed the governments decision to call the all-party meeting, heeding the demand of the Opposition parties.Steps taken by the government to tackle drought as also the funds released by it for the relief work will be among the issues to be discussed at the meeting, he said."
125,All-party team to Centre by month-end,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/243371/all-party-team-centre-month.html,2012-04-19,Deccan Herald,"Drought losses pegged at Rs 4,500 cr; CM says no waiver of farm loansA decision to this effect was taken at the all-party meeting chaired by Chief Minister D V Sadananda Gowda, to discuss strategies to tackle the drought situation, here on Thursday.The State government has revised the losses due to drought from Rs 2,605 crore to Rs 4,500 crore and wants the Centre to bear at least half the burden of losses by releasing grants to the State under NCCF.Given the fact that the government is seeking grants under NCCF, it is obvious that it wants the Centre to declare the drought in the State a national calamity.According to Central government guidelines, relief assistance under the NCCF can be sought only when there is a natural calamity of severe nature, requiring expenditure by the State government in excess of the balance available in its own Calamity Relief Fund.The State government came under criticism by the Opposition leaders, who attacked the ruling BJP for failing to take steps to mitigate the sufferings of the people. Briefing reporters after the five-and-half-hour meeting, Sadananda Gowda said the magnitude of the prevailing drought was as severe as the droughts that hit the State in 1972-73 and 1983-85.However, the chief minister stopped short of making any major announcements that could mitigate the sufferings of the people in general and farmers in particular. Asked whether the government was considering waiver of interest on crop loans, Gowda evaded a direct reply stating that he would place the proposal before the Centre.However, while interacting with the media before the meeting, he had said that it would be difficult to waive of crop loans. It is estimated that the government has to bear a burden of Rs 19,350 crore if it decides to waive of agriculture loans of the 2011-12 fiscal.While nationalised banks have lent about Rs 10,000 crore, cooperative banks and regional rural banks have lent about Rs 9,000 crore for agriculture. The Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department was taking up drinking water supply to 4,100 habitations in 26 districts under the Multi-Village Water Supply Scheme, he said.Gowda said the Met department had forecast good rainfall in the next few days and the government had adequate fertilisers and quality seeds to meet the requirements of farmers.A Cabinet sub-committee headed by the chief minister directed the energy department not to disconnect power supply in rural areas for drinking water projects, in view of the drought. In addition, he has directed the department to immediately provide electricity to new borewells in the drought-hit areas.* No foreign trips for ministers, MLAs and officials for the next two months* No unnecessary expenditure on big events, Rs four crore released for market intervention for purchase of turmeric at Rs 5,000 per quintal* To petition Centre for extending minimum support price for tur dal, potato and pomegranate* To petition Centre to provide a share to the State under its special package ofRs 1,000 crore for sericulture* Centre should pass bill to amend Article 371 D of the Constitution to provide special status to Hyderabad-Karnataka region* Write off interest on crop loans* Subsidise fertilisers* Appoint nodal officers to ensure crop insurancereaches farmers* Adequate storage of coal for thermal power plants in coming months* Address drinking water scarcity in drought-hit taluks* Restore social security benefits keeping drought in viewThe government has failed to tackle drought situation. Farmers are stuck in debt traps due to crop failure. But the government is not ready to waive of crop loans. The chief minister did not give any assurance in this regard.SiddaramaiahOpposition leaderDrought relief works are not being done properly. The government should be reaching out to the affected. I have advised the government to set up a separate agency to deal with drought.M P NadagoudaJD(U) leaderDrought has hit the farmers hard. The government must waive of crop loans in their interest. If it fails to take a decision to waive of crop loans in a few days, we will launch an agitation.Kodihalli ChandrashekarFarmers leaderThe Centre should announce a special package of Rs 1,000 crore to the State to take up drought relief works.

126,Greying green lands,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/243877/greying-green-lands.html,2012-04-21,Deccan Herald,"Subhash Chandra N S 0:58 ISTVegetable growers in and around the City are selling off their farmlands to real estate barons, triggering shortage and price escalationThe harried, clueless consumers are asking a million questions. But the answers arent far away: Increasing urban sprawl depleting the green feeder zones around the City, disappearing lakes, delayed pre-monsoon showers, and the depleting groundwater table. Sadly, nothing has been done to arrest the unbridled, scary development.Barely 12 years ago, the City sourced its greens and vegetables from its feeder zones. Despite the depleting water level, lakes recharged the water table and kept the farmers going. The Citys demand of about 3,000 tonnes of vegetables per day was met by employing various techniques such as drip irrigation. But with the Citys economy changing drastically, the trend shifted from agriculture to real estate. Arid land meant for cultivation was converted to either residential layouts or industries.Years of this unchecked growth has put Bangalore in a tight spot. The Citys markets are struggling to meet the growing demand and sell at affordable prices. As the Horticulture Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (Hopcoms), agriculture scientists and horticulture officers confirm the year-to-year vegetable prices have increased three to four times in the past five years. This year, it is creating new records.For instance, the price of tomato has touched Rs 31 per kilogram. French beans sell at Rs 45 a kg on an average. Prices of brinjal (both white and black), cabbage, capsicum, carrot, cucumber and okra have witnessed a drastic increase in price, pinching the pockets of even the middle class and upper middle class.According to B V Chikkanna, president, Hopcoms, rapid urbanisation around Bangalore district, mainly in Anekal, Devanahalli, Bidadi, Ramanagaram and Hoskote, has severely reduced vegetable cultivation leading to decreased production this year. Farmers do not have the land or water to grow vegetables due to groundwater depletion and delayed pre-monsoon showers. There is a dearth of labourers, mainly unskilled workers, who prefer to work in the City than in farms, he explains.Gone are the days when Bangaloreans got their vegetables from nearby places such as Kolar and Whitefield, says Mohammed Idrees Choudary, general secretary, Russel Market Traders Association. Areas within a radius of 100 km around the City have almost stopped growing vegetables. Very few cultivators are left now in remote pockets. The meagre number of cultivators cannot meet the growing demand of the City. Even the vegetables they send to the City are bought by five-star hotels as first preference, he says.Parvez Ahmed, secretary, Vegetable Traders Association, says the Citys demand is met by cultivators from distant locations. We get our vegetables from Hyderabad, Ooty, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad. We used to get the best varieties of ridge gourd, okra, chow-chow, beans and carrot right here once. Carrot sourced from the Bangalore Rural district was the best.It was so tasty that people preferred them to make sweet (halwa). Now, the carrot we get from Tamil Nadu is so insipid. Bangalores own varieties of brinjal and tomato and even those from Kolar have vanished, he notes.Experts blame the non-availability of vegetables to the change in land-use patterns. Water resources are drying up. The IT sector has eaten into thousands of acres of agricultural land on Hosur Road, Electronics City, Whitefield and Varthur areas, directly or indirectly.If thousands of acres of land have been given away to corporates, thrice that area have been converted into residential zones. Luxury apartments, villas and gated communities have mushroomed on the land which once grew vegetables and fruits to meet the Citys needs. Venkatapura, Uppahalli near Hoskote, and Boodhihala near Devanahalli are replete with gated communities and villa projects.A study by T V Ramachandra, senior scientist, Energy and Wetland Research Centre, Centre for Ecological Sciences, the Indian Institute of Sciences, revealed that the built-up area in the City had increased by 466 per cent between 1973 and 2007. He says Varthur and Kolar are facing water crisis and agricultural lands have shrunk in places around Bangalore.Areas connecting Kanakapura, Anekal, Varthur and Hosur have lost agricultural lands. Kolar, which catered to the Citys vegetable demands, and Varthur, which supplied vegetables like cabbage, carrot and beans to at least 15-20 per cent of the Citys population, have turned in concrete jungles, he said.Once vegetables were cultivated in Varthur using sewage water. Even that is gone now, Ramachandra points out. The groundwater level has dropped to almost 1,200 feet in Chikkaballapur, Kolar and Devanahalli region.Devanahalli and Hoskote taluks, which catered to the Citys vegetable needs for ages, have lost most of their land to industries and projects such as Bengaluru International Airport (BIA). If the government allocated over 15,000 acres to BIA, private residential layouts and road projects consumed twice that area. Several lakes and tanks which kept farms green are lost forever, and the water level has gone deeper.In Hoskote, many farmers feel cultivation of vegetables cannot sustain their livelihood. The labour cost is high, who wants to pay Rs 300 per day and cultivate. The factories set up here have increased the cost of livelihood. Even if we invest in it, we are not sure about the crop, reasons a farmer.Citing the example of the early 2000s when potato seedlings failed to yield, Yelappa, a farmer from Ulsahalli in Kasaba hobli, says, Even after cultivation, we are neither sure of the crops sustaining themselves nor is there a guarantee of getting a good price for the produce.Most farmers see land conversion and sale of agricultural land as a way out. The soaring real estate price has made its impact on several villages of Hoskote as farmers are selling their patch of land to afford the luxury of urban life. The villages of Thimmasandra, Wabalpura, Bettahalli, Doddadenhalli, Jadigenhalli, Sulebele, Venkatapura have turned into concrete jungles. Abandoned lands, dried-up lakes are a common sight in many of these places.The only silver lining seems to be some farmers in Devanahalli who want to continue with agriculture, taking it as a challenge. Despite the loss of land to real estate and the international airport, there has been surprisingly an increase in agriculture activities. But the challenge here is water scarcity and depletion of groundwater.It started in the mid-nineties. The water level dropped to 500 feet in the late nineties and it dipped further to 750 feet in the year 2000. Now, it has almost reached 1,000 feet in 2011. By 2015, the farmers of Devanahalli, Kolar and Chikkaballapur will have to migrate elsewhere, says Shivanapura Ramesh, a farmer from Devanahalli.According to him, mainly government land and dryland used for Nilgiri plantation were given for the airport project. But he too sees the water crisis as a far bigger challenge. There is a scarcity of rainfall by about 20 per cent since 1993 in this region. All our lakes are dry. Then where is the question of recharging groundwater, he wonders.To make matters worse, the dry spell during this summer has made vegetables costlier for Bangaloreans. Narayana Gowda, Vice-Chancellor, University of Agriculture Sciences, Bangalore, notes: We have the longest dry spell this year. Farmers in Kolar and parts of the Bangalore Rural district have declared crop holidays. Two-thirds of Kolars tomato-growing area are gone.If there is no rainfall within the next 15 days, we will face severe drinking water crisis, he cautioned. There is a need for change in the cropping pattern in places such as Kolar, which are not feasible for commercial crops. The other factors driving up the cost of vegetables and availability are non-availability of labour, increase in the cost of fertilisers, and the younger generation shying away from agriculture, he said."
127,"In Kashmir, some hot potatoes",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-kashmir-some-hot-potatoes/article3343593.ece,2012-04-23,The Hindu,"In the charged summer of 2010, an irate cleric from the central Kashmir town of Badgam showed me startling evidence of India's plot to destroy Islam in Kashmir: an improbably large potato. The potato, he claimed, contained pig-genes which would defile the faithful.Last month, Usmaan Raheem Ahmad  the man behind the high-yielding potatoes which the cleric had claimed induced impiety  was denied entry to India. Mr. Ahmad's path-breaking work on rural empowerment, urban entrepreneurship and women's rights had been publicly endorsed by the Chief Minister, the Governor and even the State police. He was seen by them as representing the kind of progressive intervention needed to drain the swamps of religious chauvinism and backwardness in which the Badgam cleric thrived  opening up the prospect of a new, vibrant Kashmir. For reasons no one in the Central government is willing to explain, though, New Delhi chose to shut Mr. Ahmad's work down.Full disclosure: I made several attempts to find out why Mr. Ahmad was denied entry and to see if the problem could be resolved. I was told, variously, that Mr. Ahmad had worked on a tourist visa (not true); that he met with secessionists (true, but so does the Home Minister); that a 50-page Intelligence Bureau report concluded his organisation, the Mercy Corps, was working too closely in coordination with the United States (Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government, some critics say, also does). No one actually accused Mr. Ahmad of a crime.Paralytic malaiseIn the grand scheme of things, Mr. Ahmad's fate is perhaps trivial  but his story illustrates a paralytic malaise that has gripped New Delhi's policy on Jammu and Kashmir. In recent months, this malaise has manifested itself in dogged efforts to persuade young people in the State that India is a mindless tyranny, opaque and arbitrary in its use of power.No one has seen fit to explain to the thousands of young people who saw hope in Mr. Ahmad's work why it was abruptly terminated. Nor has New Delhi explained its decision to stonewall the Chief Minister's repeated calls for phased demilitarisation. Not one reason has been given for why the government can't find the time to discuss A New Compact , the report of the three interlocutors it had appointed in 2010 to address the causes of street violence and police firing that claimed over a hundred young lives.This pattern of behaviour isn't just mystifying: it's outright dangerous.The report of interlocutors Dilip Padgaonkar, Radha Kumar and M.M. Ansari  whose details were made public by The Hindu earlier this month  essentially seeks to put Jammu and Kashmir's constitutional future on a firm basis. It advocates limiting New Delhi's future ability to intervene on legislation that does not concern the country's security or vital economic interests. The document calls for power to be devolved to the provinces, addressing the ethnic-religious anxieties and resentments that have underpinned so much of the State's problems in recent years. It calls for economic regeneration on this side of the Line of Control, and trade across it  another issue that Mr. Ahmad was working on.Few of these proposals are contentious: as the New Compact acknowledges, some of the ideas it deals with date back to 1952. Indeed, if there is one criticism to be made of the document, it is that the New Compact speaks to an old Kashmir: there is barely the whiff of radical idea in the document. New Delhi's decision not to begin discussing the New Compact bodes ill for the future. Kashmir is changing in ways that are imposing seismic pressures on its politics and polity, making real political dialogue imperative.First, Jammu and Kashmir is urbanising rapidly  a process that creates huge social strains. In just the decade between 2001 and 2011, census data show, the urban population has increased from a quarter to a third of the population as a whole. It is hard to overstate the importance of these numbers. In 1951, soon after Jammu and Kashmir acceded to India, over half of the population was rural  and 10 years later, two-thirds were living in the countryside, as radical land reforms giving rural migrant workers the opportunity to become peasants kicked in.Secondly, Jammu and Kashmir is seeing the birth of the largest youth cohort in its history  another source of strain. Three in five Jammu and Kashmir residents are either under 19 or over 60  and the young are growing fastest. This means there is great pressure on the productive age group, and an urgent need to create new jobs for those who will soon enter it.Thirdly, two decades of violence have left much of the population ill-prepared to deal with the new world that has emerged around it. The literacy rate has gone up only marginally, from 55.52 per cent to 68.74 per cent. The Planning Commission's last State development report on Jammu and Kashmir noted that all the districts affected by militancy have a low literacy rate. Kathua and Jammu, it noted, stood at the top of the pile; Srinagar at the bottom.Himachal Pradesh  a State with terrain and social conditions not dissimilar to Jammu and Kashmir  illustrates the point: even adjusted for population, the State has better education, health facilities and tourism infrastructure.Dangers aheadFrom New Delhi-based scholar Navnita Behera's survey of media consumption by young people in Kashmir, there is some evidence that this generation has attitudes quite different from those of its elders. There remains among young people in Kashmir a substantial constituency for secessionist politics: 36 per cent of those seeking azaadi  who made up a little over half the respondents  defined it to mean independence from India, accession to Pakistan, or a shari'a-governed state. Even larger numbers  61 per cent  however said they understood the term azaadi to denote greater constitutional and economic rights; one in 10 simply wanted the army out.This is evidence that the secessionist constituency is diminishing. The problem, though, is this: this generation is also disconnected, as never before, from the political system. Two decades of violence strangled democratic politics. New Delhi is now delivering the coup de grace . Little empirical work has been done on the issue, but there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that young people in search of agency are turning away from organised politics to diverse forms of religious pietism, consumerism, or nihilist street violence.Kashmir's jihadist movement was, at its core, a form of anti-politics that arose from a crisis just like this. In the 1970s and 1980s, pressures on small farmers  and growing hold of a new class of contractors and urban lites on the National Conference  created a reservoir of discontent among its traditional constituency. The party increasingly turned to religious chauvinism to hold on to its following. The Muslim United Front, representing the urban petty bourgeoisie and the rural orchard-owning elite, did so too. Islam, for the classes which backed the MUF, was an instrument to legitimise the protest of a threatened social order against a modernity which held out the prospect of obliterating it.Price of failureKashmir, scholar Thomas Marks has argued, was flattened by a demographic tidal wave of unabsorbed youthful males appearing in the late 1980s, precisely the time political issues called into question the legitimacy of the existing order. Politics ought to have addressed these issues  but New Delhi's decades-old de-institutionalisation of democracy in the State ensured it could not. The price of failure was tens of thousands of lost lives.From the English civil wars of 1642-1651 to the rise of European fascism, similar demographic trends have fuelled epic violence. In an exhaustive 2006 review of the evidence, social scientist Henrik Urdal concluded that relatively large youth cohorts are associated with a significantly increased risk of domestic armed conflict, terrorism, riots and violent demonstrations.War is father of all, wrote the ancient philosopher, Heraclitus, king of all. Some it makes gods, some it makes men, some it makes slaves, some free. Heraclitus' aphorism has been used to illustrate the uncertain fortunes of conflict. It also, perhaps, has a deeper meaning. Efforts at peace-building often seek to discover and then fix causes that drove the emergence of a conflict. Not infrequently, they fail, because the societies they address no longer exist.New Delhi's policy establishment still imagines it is dealing with a Kashmir that disappeared two decades or more ago: an illusion sustained by the fact that so many key actors are the children of the men who made the deals that propped up the State's dysfunctional political order. Its key instruments remain cajoling and co-optation  and, when it fails, outright bribery.Meaningful political dialogue, least of all the new language of transparency, rights and empowerment Mr. Ahmad represented, simply isn't on the agenda. Prime Minister Singh's government won the war in Jammu and Kashmir, inflicting a decisive defeat on the insurgency. His government's actions suggest it is now doing its best to lose the peace.praveens@thehindu.co.inNew Delhi appears determined to prove to young Kashmiris that it is a tyranny, opaque and arbitrary in its use of power."

According to a study by the horticulture department and scientists, the spud seeds from Punjab should cost not more than Rs 9.30 a kg. The DC told the traders that the seeds should be sold at the same price.The traders said the seeds cost them Rs 16.80 a kg and that they could not reduce the prices.We have suggested the farmers to grow jowar this year. We will get the jowar seeds from Tamil Nadu, if need be, and distribute them to farmers, the DC said. The farmers promised that they would grow jowar and walked out of the meeting. Potato used to be grown on 40,000 hectares in the district. The crop loss due to the angamari disease in the last three years, has resulted in the cultivation area coming down to 20,000 hectares."

We have reports from the Meteorological Department that rainfall during this monsoon will be below normal in the first few weeks. Farmers will be suggested to go for alternative crops such as maize, he said.The growers from Punjab said they would not accept the price quoted by the district administration.Following which, Mr. Mohan Raj announced that he would not allow the sale of seed potato in the district.The local farmers who attended the meeting welcomed the Deputy Commissioner's stand.Growers from Punjab demand Rs. 16.80 a kgThe price should not be more than Rs. 9.30 a kg'"
130,Hassan DC protects interest of ryots,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/245097/hassan-dc-protects-interest-ryots.html,2012-04-26,Deccan Herald,"Hassan, April 26, 2012, DHNS: 0:02 ISTKeeps potato seed sellers from Punjab at bay for quoting higher priceSending out clear message to potato seed traders from the state of Punjab, Deputy Commissioner of Hassan district said they would not be allowed sell potato seeds, if they did not reduce the inflated price.This happened at the meeting which was organised to convince potato seed traders into reducing the price quoted by them, in Hassan on Tuesday. The meeting was organised in the wake of jacked up price of potato seeds sourced from Punjab through traders.Potato has been the main crop of Hassan district since long, and seeds used to be sourced from Punjab since long.Last year the seeds were sold at Rs 800 - 900 per quintal and this year, the traders were quoting Rs 1600 per quintal. And this had shocked the farmers who didnt expect this kind of a jump in price in just a year.Having failed to negotiate with the traders, farmers and those dependant on agriculture, had approached the district administration to break the ice between traders and farmers, and help them procure seeds at a reasonable price. Scientists and officials from department of Horticulture were also present at the meeting.Addressing the meeting, Deputy Commissioner K P Mohan Raj said: Farmers who have been growing potato since last few years, are in deep distress since blight disease is affecting the crop. Now, if the seeds also turn costly, farmers would be in dire straits.According to department of meteorology, first two months of monsoon will bring less rains than normal. This is bound to have an effect on the potato production and chances of them suffering a loss is pretty high.As per our estimate prepared by scientists and department of horticulture, seeds from Punjab cost Rs 9.30 per kilo, at the highest. And that should be the selling price.However, the traders from Punjab were in no mood to listen. They said the seeds cost them Rs 16.80 per kilo and they were not willing to sell them for any less.They were opposed by the farmers at the meeting, even as the discussion was on. Since the traders were not willing to change their stance, Deputy Commissioner K P Mohan Raj said the traders would not be allowed to sell potato seeds.DC said the farmers had been directed to grow maize and that district administration will put in all efforts to publicise this better among people. If need be, we will source maize seeds from neighbouring Tamil Nadu and provide them to the farmers.Dictate termsNever will the district administration allow traders to dictate terms and decide the fate of farmers, he said without mincing words.Even the farmers left the meeting assuring the traders that they would grow maize.Potato was grown across 40,000 hectare in the past, but had to be reduced to 20,000 hectare owing to incessant attack of blight disease which left the farmer with less produce per acre.Every year, the district buys about 10 lakh tones of potato seeds and in the current year, about five lakh tones is stored in cold storage units. Warning the traders against selling the seeds, Deputy Commissioner said the traders could sell them post-July, but the current season was out of question."

The table potatoes, supplied by many growers in Punjab as seeds, are of inferior quality, said Potato Club president H. Yoga Ramesh in Hassan on Thursday.In response to a query at the press conference in Hassan, Mr. Yoga Ramesh said last year the club had procured 3,000 bags of certified seeds from registered growers in Punjab and provided them to farmers in Arkalgud taluk. He claimed that the yield in fields where certified seeds were sown was better than that in the fields where non-certified seeds were sown. However, besides quality of seeds, soil treatment and scientific measures to avert attack of virus causing blight disease was also important. Growers can counter spread of blight only if they join hands with neighbouring farmers and take precautionary measures to avoid spread of the virus, he said.Further, he said the production of certified seeds of potato in the country was in no way near to the total demand. The State government should make efforts to get foundation seeds of potato and encourage production of certified seeds so that the demand could be met. Local farmers lack awareness about certified seeds. The club is planning to hold workshops for farmers on potato cultivation, he said.The sale of seed potatoes in Hassan district is on rough turf as the producers of seed potatoes and the district administration fail to arrive at a consensus on the price of seed potatoes in the district. Deputy Commissioner K.P. Mohan Raj has said he will not allow sale of seed potatoes at exorbitant prices.Potato Club president says they had procured 3,000 bags of certified seeds last yearIn places where it was used, he says, the yield was better than that in other places"

With zero import duty on import at the LOC trade points, Pakistani potato is cheaper than the Indian variety by 20% to 40%.India's potato production is expected to be 33.5-34 million tonne this year, which is 10-15% less than last year. This is due to lower production in Bihar, West Bengal and certain parts of Uttar Pradesh. With a small crop to be harvested in Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka in August, prices are expected to remain steady this year.""A good bumper crop in Pakistan coupled with a stronger Indian Rupee against the Pakistani Rupee are creating opportunities for traders to import Pakistani potato,"" said Sachid Madan, director, Technico Agri Sciences (a subsidiary of the cigarette to hotel major ITC Ltd).Indian traders imported 200-250 trucks (10- 15 tonne per truck) over the past two weeks through the Srinagar- Muzaffarabad and Poonch-Rawalkot trade posts.""Higher prices of Indian potato made us start importing potato from Pakistan. We have started dispatching trucks to New Delhi's Azadpur mandi and markets in Punjab. The demand from Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh traders has also started coming in who intend to transport it via train,"" said Srinagar LoC Trade Union secretary and King Khan Trading Co owner Hilal Turki.The weekly demand for white and red skinned potato in the Jammu and Kashmir market is over 100 trucks, he said.""Hence there was sufficient stock to be sent to other states. White skin potato was being imported for Rs 8-9 a kg and the red skin for Rs 10-11. Compared to it the Indian white skin potato in wholesale were selling for Rs 12-13 and red skin like Lady Rosetta for Rs 16-17 a kg,"" said Pathankot-based trader Umesh Kumar.On account of considerable price difference, import is expected to increase as many more traders are open to sourcing potato from Pakistan.""Domestic potato prices are more than double than the previous year. To cater to the domestic market and processing industry we are interested to get the Pakistan potato,"" said Agra-based farmer, processer and exporter,"" Manesh Agarwal.

Low produce due to scorching summer and the marriage season in full swing are the key reasons for the price hike. Rythu Bazaar officials said that some vegetable prices have increased due to poor supply.The price of french beans reached a season high of Rs 100 per kg. The prevailing price of tomatoes is Rs 30 per kg in Mir Alam Mandi, three times its rate of Rs 10 per kg last week. Potatoes climbed from Rs 10 two weeks ago to Rs 16 on Wednesday. The price of cabbage rose from Rs 13 last week to Rs 20.Vendors of Mir Alam Mandi, Madannapet and Nampally markets say that both the summers and unseasonal rains have destroyed crops. They attribute the increase in prices to the marriage season. Mohammed Omar a vegetable vendor from Miralam Mandi said, ""This is the time for both Hindu and Muslim weddings. That's why prices are high.""Moiz Khan, an IT professional, noted that the prices of certain vegetables had markedly risen since last week. ""The price of french beans refuses to fall. I bought it for Rs 70 per kg, tomatoes for Rs 30 and potatoes for Rs 18 per kg as against Rs 10 last week,"" he said. M A Rafe, another consumer from Noor Khan Bazaar feared prices could increase further because of a fuel hike in the offing. ""It is only natural that prices of vegetables will rise due to increase in transportation costs on account of a hike in diesel prices. The average consumer is already paying between 5 per cent and 20 percent extra for essential commodities. Another hike could make things worse.""P S Pradunma, CEO, Rythu Bazaar said that the prices have indeed risen due to low produce, high transportation costs and low rainfall. ""The trend is such that prices reach their peak in April. The prices of vegetables on an average have indeed increased since last year as arrivals have dropped. For instance, arrivals of french beans have fallen. Last year arrival of French beans was 104 quintals, but is 50 quintals this year."""

However, an agreement is yet to be reached on the price.The district administration wants the price of the seed to be Rs. 10 a kg, while growers are demanding at least Rs. 16.50 a kg.Deputy Commissioner K.P. Mohan Raj said at a meeting on April 25 that the price quoted by them was not acceptable and he appealed to the farmers to go for crops such as maize.Farmers here prefer potato in the kharif season as it can be harvested in three months and the produce will fetch a good price. For the last three years, the production came down owing to blight. However, farmers continue to cultivate the crop, hoping there will be good rain. We expect that the area under cultivation will be around 25,000 hectares this year, said Shakeel Ahmed, Deputy Director, Horticulture.According to sources, cold storage units here have sufficient stock of seeds.Growers' standThe Jalandhar Potato Growers' Association said, in a press release, that it was impossible to sell seeds at rates lower than the market price. It is not fair to impress upon the potato growers to dispose of the stocks at a price lower than the prevailing rates which is between Rs. 14 and Rs. 15 per kg. It seems that certain vested interests are misleading the administration, it added.The sources said that the growers were trying for an agreement with the administration because they would have to pay more to keep the seeds in cold storage. The sale of seeds is expected to begin in the second week of May if the administration and growers reach a consensus on the price."
138,Hassan farmers at cross roads,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/246782/hassan-farmers-cross-roads.html,2012-05-03,Deccan Herald,"Hassan, May 3 2012, DHNS: 23:28 ISTAvailing potato seeds is a problem; experts suggest to grow maizeTraditional potato growers who tried growing ginger and turmeric also suffered loss. So they are at crossroads. Now, they are expected to return to potato cultivation.If untimely rains and flood accompanied with late blight disease were the main problems facing the farmers over the past three years, this year seeds itself has become a big issue. The quantity of potato seeds used per hectare of land is enormous compared to other crops.While 250 gm of tomato seeds are sufficient for one hectare of land, potato needs 1,250 kg of seeds for the same area of land. For every one kg seeds the farmers should cultivate ten kg potato. But, farmers contend that none of them in the region have harvested more than eight kg in the recent past.This year, traders from Jalandhar in Punjab are quoting Rs 1,680 for one kg of seeds. If the cost of fertilisers, pesticides and labour are added, the expenditure becomes a burden on farmers. However, farmers are getting ready for a big gamble, inevitably.The district administration has tried to talk to traders to reduce the price of potato seeds. But it has not helped the farmers. The traders claim that their stocks are not at all seeds, but only table potatoes. The procedure to produce seeds is scientifically laid out and it has to be certified by qualified scientists. The seeds are not certified, so the traders claims are justified.But, considering the uncertified potatoes itself as seeds, the district administration has urged the traders not to sell them above Rs 1,000 per kg. Even farmers are not willing to shell out more than Rs 1,100 per kg.Pundits foresee great demand for potatoes as the yield has reduced. They feel if Hassan farmers also shy away from growing potatoes, the demand would double and the price would reach Rs 20 per kg. However, horticulture department officials say the loss to farmers this year would exceed the loss over the past three years. They recommend maize as an alternative crop.Deputy director for horticulture Shakeel Ahmed said traders have been urged to reduce their margin this year and plan to make profits in coming years."

However, traders did not agree. Farmers insisted that MLA H D Revanna fix a price. But he shied away and asked the farmers to fix a price and said he would only support them.The traders also discouraged him from stating something concrete. They said it was their produce and only they had the right to quote a price. It is not only farmers in Hassan. Even farmers in Punjab have suffered huge losses, they added.As the meeting was leading nowhere, Revanna, deputy commissioner K P Mohanraj and traders held a closed-door meeting at the DCs chamber. As traders did not budge, Revanna walked out.Finally, farmers announced that they would sell the seeds at Rs 14 per kg and the price would apply only for the existing stocks. They sought police protection when they take out seeds from cold storage.Farmers fear that the price of potato seeds may be exorbitantly high when the next stocks arrive, because it would be time for sowing and they would be forced to buy at any cost.Meanwhile, MLA H D Revanna urged the state government to intervene in the interest of farmers.Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, he pointed out that last year crop was lost in 18,000 hectares of land out of the total crop area of 22,000 hectares.Stating that Rs 800 would have been spent for growing one quintal of seeds, he said Rs 1,000 would be reasonable, including a margin."

During her research in the village, she had noticed that potato growers were suffering losses owing to a fall in the production because of blight. Growers required timely advice from experts to tackle the disease. The government should announce support price when the price of the produce falls in the market, she said in the paper.The paper presented by Asha, another student, focused on the problems affecting sugarcane growers of Nagasamudra in Channarayapatna.Each paper presentation was followed by a discussion in the presence of the teaching staff and students.While Krupa M.G. presented a paper on the facilities available in the college, a couple of other students had the economic status of autorickshaw drivers in Hassan city as the topic of their papers.Other papers dwelt on issues such as implementation of rural development programmes, economic analysis of poultry industry, and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Earlier, V.V. Jagadish, associate professor of Economics, who inaugurated the seminar, said that research in economics was essential to analyse and understand the economic growth of a country. Such studies would influence the governments to revise their policies, he said. He advised the students to choose a subject which was close to their heart and decide the objectives of their study. Students should never feel that research was a burden, he said.H.V. Lakshminarayana, principal of the college, said research would help students in understanding their subject better.He said he was glad that one of the students had done a study on the facilities available in the college.

Worse is in store given that the government recently increased the export limit of sugar. Prices that had stabilized to Rs 34-35 per kg are now likely to shoot beyond the average.""Staple vegetables without which no meal is complete have come to cost the earth. Tomatoes are selling anywhere between Rs 30 and Rs 45 per kg, three times over the average Rs 10-12. Potatoes cost Rs 20-24 in the retail market, twice the regular rate,"" says Shrikant Desai, a government employee who lives in Bandra (E). ""We were so happy when the government implemented the Sixth Pay Commission report and increased our salaries, but inflation is fast eating into the additional income.""What angers citizens is the complete lack of correlation between wholesale and retail prices. Vendors have begun charging up to 100% more than wholesale rates in areas like Malabar Hill, Bandra, Andheri and Borivli and residents do not know whom to complain to. Ramchandra Buchke of Navnath Fruit Agency in Navi Mumbai says the wholesale rate of apples and grapes has fallen by 30-40% since last week but the reduction has not been passed on to consumers. Grapes, for instance, cost Rs 60-70 in the wholesale market, while imported apples cost Rs 100. But retail consumers are paying up to Rs 150, even Rs 200, in Mumbai.As if inflationary pressure was not enough, customers complain that retailers in Mumbai are devising new ways to cheat them. ""Residents in Andheri and Borivli report that grocers and vegetable sellers quote a low price for an item, and once the consumer orders a fair amount and prepares to pay, they suddenly quote a higher figure, accusing the buyer of not having heard correctly,"" says Ashwini Mehta, who finds this trend rampantly growing in Four Bungalows and Lokhandwala markets in Andheri (west).Ameya Vartak, who delivers vegetables and fruits to homes in central Mumbai, does not deny the presence of cartelization working to consumer's detriment. ""Inflation has increased legitimate costs of labour and transportation as well. But when prices go up, buyers also fall prey to mixing where unscrupulous vendors add substandard produce to the finer variety,"" he said.

143,"How normal monsoon could impact agriculture, inflation, income & storage",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/How-normal-monsoon-could-impact-agriculture-inflation-income-storage/articleshow/13018122.cms,2012-05-06,The Times Of India,"Last week, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) released its first annual monsoon forecast for June-September . Monsoons are likely to be normal with the probability of deficient or excessive monsoons being relatively low, according to IMD. If this prediction comes true, what does this really mean for India's economy? Impact on agricultural output: The first and most important impact is, of course, on agricultural production, especially in the kharif or summer season. ""This is because about 55% of cropped area is dependent on monsoon rains and does not have irrigation support,"" says Chetan Ahya, MD, Morgan Stanley Research.While the impact on summer crops may be more direct, there is also an indirect impact on rabi (winter) crops like wheat and oilseeds. ""Rainfall during June-September season impacts ground water and reservoir levels and is also critical for irrigation of rabi crops,"" says Ramesh Chand, director, National Centre for Agricultural Economics and Policy (NCAP).Variations across time and space:However , the impact of rainfall on agricultural production also varies depending on how rainfall is distributed across states and the distribution over the months. For instance , despite good monsoons in 2011-12 , production of oilseeds, pulses and coarse cereals was low as the spread of rainfall in the western belt was affected, points out Ashok Gulati, chairman, Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). ""To assess the impact of monsoons on crop output, one has to look at rainfall in each zone and the cropping pattern there,"" he adds. The great drought of 2009 points to another case where food grain production actually marginally increased compared to the 2003 drought when food grain production declined by 17%. This was because the 2009 drought was concentrated in areas around Punjab and western UP and crop output here wasn't as affected as these are heavily irrigated regions.There could also be below normal rainfall in the initial months of the season followed by above normal monsoons in the last two months. A delayed monsoon may lead to delayed sowing, thereby impacting yields.Impact on inflation:With agriculture contributing to 17% of India's GDP and providing employment to 58% of the population, any impact of monsoons on agricultural growth would feed into prices, incomes and GDP growth. Food inflation was already around 10% in March.A recent Barclays report by Siddhartha Sanyal says that ""apart from one spike in January 2011 (mainly due to vegetable prices), normal rainfall tends to have a moderating effect on agriculture prices"" . The report also says that due to two largely regular monsoon seasons in the past two years, certain agriculture products like cereal and cotton have seen relatively lower inflation after the 2009 drought.According to assessments of crop production released by the agriculture ministry earlier this year, India is estimated to have witnessed a record production of rice, wheat and cotton in 2011-12 and experts say a favourable monsoon in 2012 would ensure that the prices of these would remain stable or go down.But a normal monsoon is not the only factor. ""Food inflation is due to articles like vegetable, fruits and milk which depend on the demand side of the economy and monsoons have a much lower impact on these,"" says YK Alagh, an agriculture expert. And government policy plays a big part too. If the government accepts the CACP recommendations of an increase in the minimum price to be paid to farmers, prices could be pushed higher as well.Economists say the relationship between monsoons and rural incomes is tenuous at best and the impact on income varies from crop to crop. For instance according to NCAP's Chand, in years of good monsoons, farmers tend to shift towards production of high-income crops like rice and wheat from low-income crops like coarse cereals so there is definitely some income effect. And a good monsoon, translated into higher agricultural and rural incomes would potentially keep consumer spending robust. For instance , according to sources in Hyderabad , even in a small taluk HQ in a backward mandal, dealers in John Deere equipment expect sales to pick up if the monsoons are good.But an overproduction of crops can lead to a glut in prices like in the case of potatoes last year. Also, costs of production have been growing at around 15% p.a. For instance, fertiliser costs have doubled in 2011-12 and labour costs have gone up by 75% in the past three years so even if normal monsoons and higher minimum support prices lead to higher farm incomes , the profit margins needn't be dramatically higher, points out Gulati. So for now the impact on income and consumption are a conjecture at best.With already record production of food grain estimated last year, normal monsoons could put further pressure on storage, especially of food grain. ""Storage is already in a crisis situation . By June 1, 2012, there will be 75 million tonnes of food grain stocks while the total storage capacity is less than 50 million . The rest are more or less exposed to rain damage,"" says Gulati."

But it has failed to do so.The district has already experienced showers twice and the deputy commissioner has to take steps to distribute seeds at nominal price, Chandrashekar said.The farmers had tilled their land and were ready to sow potato seeds since the past 20 days as it is the right time for sowing activities. Unavailability of the seeds has caused losses to the farmers. He also complained of discrimination of the traders towards the farmers and sought action against them. Chandrashekar also demanded that the seeds at the cold storage be distributed at a lesser price and if the traders incur any losses, the government should bear it.Loss of fertilisers, no suitable price for turmeric, ginger has made the lives of the growers miserable. He also urged the government pay pending dues to sugarcane growers and if it fails to respond to the farmers demands it would be inevitable to intensify the protests, he warned. They began a protest rally from N R Circle and formed human chains in between and culminated at the deputy commissioners office.The absence of the officials to interact or to receive the memorandum from the farmers, who had gathered in the premises irked the farmers who locked the office of the deputy commissioner. They even had a wordy duel with the staff and policemen who prevented them. Finally, tahsildar Manjunath arrived at the spot and received the memorandum."
146,"Going back to roots, are we?",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/247990/going-back-roots-we.html,2012-05-08,Deccan Herald,"Mysore, May 8, 2012, DHNS : 22:15 ISTVegetables weigh in gold; greens have gotten dearer too!If prices continue to skyrocket the way they are now, very soon people will be able to afford only roots and tubes that grow under the earth.After all, not many people will want to buy beans at Rs 100 per kilo and see it wither next day. Its truly a thing of heartache.While temperatures are killing and the heat is getting unbearable, another factor thats contributing to life turning miserable these days is the price of vegetables.With the existing prices, majority of the middle class can only afford to buy it in grams and not in kilos as they did even few weeks ago.Mysore gets its share of vegetables from Srirangapatna, KR Pet, Jayapura, Baradanapura and surrounding places. Everyday, city consumes about five tones of vegetables and fruits, generating around Rs 2.5 lakh as the transaction amount.Hopcoms store manager C S Shivanna feels the price rise is owing to scarce supply of vegetables and fruits to yards. But, the farmers who grow greens, vegetables and fruits, had a different story to tell. We get only four to six hours of three phase power to be able to supply water to our fields.Borewells have no water. Power problem has been too actue, and hence the production was less which has resulted in hike in prices, say the farmers.If mango is the king of fruits, then the crown of king of vegetables is a rolling one. Last year while tur dal cost a fortune (touching even Rs 100 per kilo), and onion matched the price with it touching the same price bracket; beans has slowly but surely occupied that place now. The slender green juicy beans costs a good Rs 80 -Rs 100 depending on where you buy it. Greens are no less either. Corriander is scarce.And wherever one can find it, it costs pretty dear to be owned. A bunch of corriander which did not cost more than Re one till few days ago, is now a good Rs 15 per bunch.According to vegetable seller Gopal, this trend is disturbing since greens have very short shelf life and sellers usually dont have the investing capacity to preserve their colour and shape, and avoid from whithering.Other greens such as curry leaves, mint, spinach and desi varieties have shot up from mere 50 paise to five rupees. Carrot costs Rs 40 (Rs 30 previously) and cabbage has touched Rs 28 from Rs eight, earlier.Some of the vegetables which have brought respite to people include Mangalore cucumber, tomato, and brinjal -- all have come down by Rs 10 per kilo. However, potato which cost Rs 15 earlier, now costs Rs 22.Among fruits, apple which has always remained dear, has turned dearer costing Rs 154 per kilo. Oranges cost Rs 80, a jump from Rs 30 earlier. According to B M Shivalingappa, Managing Director, Mysore-Chamarajanagar district Hopcoms, the cost fluctuation is due to scarce availability of labour in areas where the greens and vegetables are grown.As a result, even the production has come down, and second generation farmers are moving away from the occupation, making it even more difficult.Land is diminishing with people converting them into sites and residential layouts. When there is scarcity, middle men also contribute to it, and jack up the prices by holding the goods. Customer, who is the king, is forced to bear the cross, the officer adds."

It was led by Kodihalli Chandrashekhar.The protesters formed a human chain at N.R Circle before staging the dharna.They claimed that the cost of bringing seed potato from Punjab to Hassan would be around Rs. 350 a quintal.The administration should have fixed the price at Rs. 650 a quintal, after including transportation charges and commission to mediators. However, the price quoted by merchants was Rs. 1,400 a quintal.Meanwhile, the farmers locked the door of the Deputy Commissioner's chamber here as officials did not receive their memorandum for a long time."

Residents in many localities of the city, including Thiruvanmiyur, Nungambakkam and Adyar, said they enjoyed a breezy morning, which was a welcome relief after the sweltering past week. An overcast sky for the most part of the day, led to a sharp dip in the day temperature. While the maximum temperature in Nungambakkam was 35.4 degree Celsius, Meenambakkam recorded 37.2 degree Celsius.Officials of the Meteorological department said the increased cloud cover on Monday, had weakened the westerly wind that brings in hot air. Easterlies, which were responsible for the cool breeze, had set in as early as 7 a.m., bringing down the temperature. A weak cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal is also cited as one of the reasons for the change in weather. Residents can expect the next two days to remain relatively cool.However, the contrasting weather in the city and in neighbouring states over the past few days has influenced a further hike in vegetable prices. Traders at the Koyambedu vegetable market, the wholesale hub of produce, said the rains and a dip in crop yields in other states such as Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh had led to an escalation in vegetable prices by a minimum of Rs. 4 a kg.While beans cost Rs. 70 a kg in the wholesale market, potatoes and carrots cost Rs. 16 a kg and Rs. 28 a kg respectively. Drumsticks and beetroots also cost more.M. Susheela, a resident of Korattur, said: I was shocked when I checked the price list of vegetables at a nearby retail store. I did not buy the expensive vegetables such as beans that cost Rs. 80 a kg, and carrots priced at Rs. 50 a kg. Even potatoes that are usually priced around Rs. 15 cost Rs.22 a kg.Onions are perhaps one of the few vegetables that have had stable prices over the past few days.Beans cost Rs. 70 a kg and potatoes and carrots cost Rs. 16 a kg and Rs. 28 a kg respectively"

After several rounds of meeting the Punjab traders accepted to sell seeds at Rs 1,400, which was not accepted by the district administration.Meanwhile, several protests were held by the farmers condemning the district administration for failing to sort out the issue.At the sixth round of meeting held on Tuesday, the price was finally fixed at Rs 1,300.

Stating that the current price of potato seeds was not feasible for farmers, Revanna said: Rs 13 has been fixed as rate for per kilo of potato seeds.This is way beyond the means of farmers in the area. State should provide seeds at a cost of Rs 1000 or Rs 1100 per quintal. We do not like to meddle with the states decision at this stage, but we urge the CM, district in-charge minister and district administration arrive at a price affordable for farmers.Though the CM and district incharge minister had promised to arrive at a decision regarding providing subsidy to potato seeds soon, no decision has been made.Since potato seeds would be distributed from Thursday, its imperative that the state decides on this issue sooner, failing which, it would become inevitable for him to stage a dharna with the farmers in tow.A meeting regarding this issue has been called in Hassan on Thursday, he added. While elected representatives will sit in front of CMs residence, party workers would take out peaceful procession in Hassan, he added.SecurityIn view of the potato seed distribution beginning on Thursday, a lot of farmers are expected to arrive at APMC to buy them.Police department should provide adequate security to avoid any untoward incident, Revanna said, adding the deputy commissioner had promised to open a 24-hr counter for disbursal of seeds, and this should be done as soon as possible."

The major supply of potato is from Agra while cauliflowers and cabbages come from Belgaum, which is 350 kms from Pune. So, vegetables are bound to get costlier,"" said Shivlal Bhosale, chairman of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Commission Agents' Association.Major supply pockets around city are located in Junnar, Pirangut, Wagholi, Ranjangaon, Khed-Shivapur and Nanded Phata. Most of the agricultural land in these areas is now occupied by industries or houses. Due to urbanization, farmers prefer to sell their vegetables in the local market instead of sending it all the way to Pune city.Areas such as Deccan Gymkhana, Model Colony, Bhosalenagar, Kothrud, parts of Karvenagar, Tilak Road, Satara Road, Pune Camp, Wanowrie, Koregaon Park, Kalyaninagar, Vimannagar, Pashan, Aundh and Baner are considered prime locations and prices of vegetables here are much higher as compared to those in Peth areas, Katraj, Khadki, Hadapsar, Kalewadi and Pimpri Chinchwad.Cluster beans, spinach, fenugreek, green peas along with carrot and cucumber are the most popular vegetables. Fenugreek had a price tag of Rs 15 per bunch while cluster beans and snake gourd were sold at Rs 40 per kg. Potatoes, which were sold at Rs 10 per kg in January, are currently sold for Rs 16 per kg.If it rains in villages around the city by the second week of June, the prices should cool down.

There's hardly anything to give it away, just a sign along the NH 17 announcing its presence. And then it hits you; right in the middle of busy, noisy Porvorim is this slice of serenity. Dressed in pristine white and shadowed by mango trees is Maracas.A tapas bar that promises soul-satisfying food is not an everyday endeavour in Goa. Few can perhaps claim to successfully run such a venture so far away from where the original concept began. But Ralph Pinto is one of the brave ones. He came down from Canada and saw potential in a Spanish-style dining experience. The restaurant has just a few months under its belt but has already got people talking about it.The decor and ambience aside, the one aspect that sticks, and perhaps the only one that matters, is the food. With an exceptionally large variety of 'bite size' portions, the menu is dotted with dishes that draw inspiration from all around the world.Start your meal with a light, fresh bruchetta. The flavours of the spicy tomato, salty feta and crunch of garlic toast explode in your mouth and prepare you for the next round.Perhaps if dates are to your liking, the Goan chorice-stuffed dates will be right up your alley. Who would have thought the marriage of spicy, tangy Goan sausage and sweet, succulent Middle Eastern dates would be one made in heaven? But it is, and it's dishes like these that have you scouring the menu and wanting to sample more.And that's just what Maracas anticipates from its guests. Which is why all the tapas have an option of a smaller portion and a slightly larger one for those who need a little more to hit the spot.Everything on offer comes either in twos or sixes. Another must-try is the self-explanatory bloody Mary prawns. And you can't go home without picking on one of their 'sliders'. There are at least five combinations of toppings that top your mini burger. So depending on your taste buds or even your mood that day you have plenty to choose from.And surprisingly, in the utmost pleasant way, is the variety of vegetarian options. The poached pears with cream cheese filling is unusually delicious. The combination of the sweet pear and luxuriant cheese topped with the crunchy walnuts works wonderfully. And if you still have room after sampling the myriad morsels on offer, wade over to the main course section and take your pick between the tender Mediterranean beef tenderloin and the Maracas-special baked potato melt.Currently ongoing, is a two-day grill food special ending on Sunday. There are wings, chops, steaks and seafood on offer, apart from the usual menu.At Maracas, they encourage you to take your time with your food. Intersperse it with a drink or two and lots of conversation. It's not unusual to see people come in here at 7pm for a drink and end up staying back till 12am for ""just one more for the road"".It is open six days a week, from 11am till midnight, with Tuesday being their day off.++++What to eatSLIDERSPhiladelphia rollsCost factorA meal for two without alcohol would cost rs 1500"

Pressure remains on food inflation. Going ahead there are several pressure points for inflation such as possible revision of fuel prices, minimum support price for crops and upward revision in power tariff,"" said D.K.

It stood at 10.49% compared to the previous month's 9.94% increase. This was the first time in six months that food inflation has breached the double-digit mark.Vegetable prices, which had shown some signs of easing in the previous months, shot up an annual 60.97% in April compared to a 30.57% rise in March, while potato prices rose 53.44% year-on-year in April from the previous month's 11.60%. Price of pulses also shot up an annual 11.29% in April from the previous month's 10.05%. Egg, meat, fish and milk prices also remained stubborn in April.While vegetable prices are often seasonal, in case of protein-rich items, supply has failed to keep pace with demand, which has exerted pressure.Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee once again reiterated the government's concern but had nothing concrete to offer to tackle the problem of high food inflation which has been plaguing the economy for a significant period now. Experts have called for increasing productivity and reducing supply side bottlenecks to ease inflationary pressures but the response to the problem has been tardy.""Food inflation is a matter of concern, particularly it has reached double digit...Food inflation can be tackled by creating storage facilities and cold chains and also through institutional reforms in agricultural marketing,"" Mukherjee said.""In both these areas state governments have to take appropriate steps, I will also discuss with them,"" he said.The acceleration in inflation hurt sentiment in the stock market, and was one of the factors which drove stock prices down on Monday. Growing uncertainty about the state of the economy, the global economic situation and the future of reforms have added to worries in domestic financial markets.The index for food articles group rose by 4.9% to 206.4 from 196.8 for the previous month due to higher prices of fruits and vegetables (19%), barley (5%), tea (4%), masur, maize and bajra (3% each) and ragi and wheat (2% each) and fish-marine, gram, rice and milk (1% each).The government also revised upwards the inflation number for February to 7.36% from the previously reported 6.95%, which analysts said showed that inflationary pressures remained strong.The latest inflation data could also force the government to postpone any increase in fuel prices. The easing global crude oil prices could help, but any move to resist raising prices could upset its plans to repair government finances.The index for manufactured products group rose by 1% to 143.6 from 142.2% for the previous month.Economists said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to be cautious in easing interest rates against the backdrop of inflationary pressures. Last month, the RBI had announced a surprise half-a-percentage point cut in interest rates to boost faltering growth, although it had warned that inflation remained a risk. Industrial output in March had declined 3.5% fuelling expectations that the central bank may aggressively cut interest rates to support growth.""The April inflation outcome is a timely reminder for not being excessively optimistic about India's inflation outlook. In particular, the heightened expectation about RBI easing after the disappointing March industrial production should have evaporated after the inflation print. Admittedly, headline inflation is off its peak but still remains elevated,"" Rajeev Malik, senior economist at CLSA in Singapore.""We maintain that inflation will continue to be a challenge for some time despite weaker growth. In fact, India is likely to continue with the combination of weak growth and still-high inflation, and it is best not to expect much in terms of easing from RBI,"" Malik.Crisil Research said that over the past seven years, the Wholesale Price Index-based primary food index has risen to 206.4 in April, 2012, from 100.4 in April, 2005, which implied that over this period money needed to buy the same basket of food items has more than doubled.""Food inflation is set to rise further with the steep hike proposed in minimum support prices (MSP). MSPs of food articles have witnessed a surge over the past three years. For instance, MSP in wheat has risen to Rs 1,120 per quintal in 2011-12, compared to Rs 630 per quintal in 2004-05. Since MSPs tend to set a floor for prices, wholesale price of wheat has also during this period moved higher in tandem,"" the ratings agency said in a report.""With food inflation already crossing double-digit, any further increase in MSPs and hence market prices could push food inflation higher. With fuel inflation expected to remain high and manufacturing inflation set to rise, at least temporarily, to reflect the pass through of indirect taxes, higher food inflation will add to inflationary pressures. It would especially pose a threat if higher food inflation leads to the wage-price spiral, thereby raising overall inflation further,"" it added."

Its core ingredient, potato, has been added to the ever increasing list of 'unaffordables' with its average wholesale price having gone up by 150% since January. Azadpur mandi officials say production at the end of 2011 was so much that a lot of the crop went waste. The plantation in January came down consequently and though there is no shortage, prices are up.In January, the average cost of a kilogram of potato in the mandi was Rs 4. Next month, it rose slightly to about Rs 4.50. By March-end, the cost had risen to Rs 7 per kg while April saw it climb even higher to Rs 10.13. According to the latest figures from Azadpur mandi for May 9, the average cost of a kilogram of potato is Rs 10.25 while the most expensive variety costing about Rs 12 per kg. In the retail market, the same amount can be purchased for anything between Rs 20 and Rs 25.""In November and December, potato production had gone up manifold and a lot of it rotted in godowns. Even then, prices came down substantially as there was such a flood of potato in the market. Consequently, farmers decided to move to other crops and the next plantation in January came down. Compared to the last plantation, the production this time is much lower but there is no shortage of the vegetable. Even now, about 100 trucks arrive at the mandi of which 10-20 trucks remain unsold. But because of the general perception of a lower produce, the costs have gone up,"" said Rajender Bhatia, chairman, Delhi Agricultural Marketing Board.Prices started climbing around end-March as that was the period when the fresh produce entered the market. ""Delhi gets its supply from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. These states also supply to most of north India,"" said a source.Aarti Sharma, who runs a hostel in south Delhi, purchases her vegetables in bulk from a retailer who gives her a discount over retail rates. Despite this, she says, her vegetable bill has risen massively over the past few months. ""I am purchasing potatoes for Rs 16 per kg from my vendor while the market rate is about Rs 20-22 per kg in Gautam Nagar. I have observed an approximately 30% rise in vegetable prices since the beginning of this year,"" she said.Vandana Agarwal, a resident of IP Extension, said: ""There is no difference between the retailers and the bigger fruit and vegetable chains.

161,"Vegetables baked by bad weather, fuel cost",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/Vegetables-baked-by-bad-weather-fuel-cost/articleshow/13159378.cms,2012-05-16,The Times Of India,"KOCHI: Vegetable price values are running neck-and-neck with inflation. Over the past month, prices of essential vegetables have soared by over 25% in the Kerala market. Since a huge component of the vegetables traded in Kerala come from outside the state, transport costs have added to inflationary trends, traders said.While prices of almost every vegetable traded in the market are volatile at least 2-3 times a year, the month of April was particularly cruel as headline inflation rose to 7.23%, leading to onions, fruits and essential Kerala menu-centric vegetables like beetroot, banana (nendran), cabbage, carrot, green chilli and drumsticks becoming dearer. And, maintaining their high price levels.""Inflation of food prices in general is primarily being caused by higher transport costs and labour arbitrage. In the case of vegetables, lower than expected rainfall in Tamil Nadu - which supplies us vegetables like carrot, cabbage and beetroot - has caused price inflation. Water shortage is rife this summer and a number of power cuts in Tamil Nadu, on a daily basis, has led to prices of vegetables shooting up,"" said vegetable trader K B Jamal.Cabbage was selling at Rs 40 per kg on Tuesday in Ernakulam from Rs 31 per kg in the first week of April. ""Cabbage, which comes from Mettupalayam, has been affected by water shortage there,"" Jamal said. Carrot was selling 50% higher at Rs 36 per kg from Rs 24 per kg in April and potato - up 38% - at Rs 25 per kg from Rs 18 last month. Prices of small onions had shot up 100% to Rs 24 as of Tuesday. Nendran brought from Tamil Nadu showed a steep 44% price increase at Rs 46 per kg from Rs 32 in April.In the Koothattukulam market, nendran auction prices touched a record Rs 50.50 per kg on Monday. Traders felt this could rise to as high as Rs 60 per kg once the nendran stock reaches the market. Complicating matters further is the widespread destruction of nendran plantations in Kerala by heavy winds and summer rainfall.Traders noted that the current phase is likely to last 2-3 weeks till rainfall patterns turn positive. ""Tamil Nadu is the primary vegetable supplier to Kerala and lack of water in Tamil Nadu has sent prices shooting up. We have noticed that the stock arriving from other states has fallen considerably. This is likely to continue till the rains pick up in the growing areas,"" said Fasal Rahman, a trader in the Ernakulam market.After the government decided to link diesel prices to market rates, a price increase is rumoured this month. This, combined with the higher labour costs and scanty rainfall, worries the trading community more than the demand-supply paradigm.""If diesel prices increase, there will be a permanent negative impact on vegetable prices. I believe that only a small basket of vegetables have been affected by price rise so far, especially vegetables imported from other states like Tamil Nadu and Punjab. Potatoes imported from Punjab are costlier and a diesel price increase will have a terrible impact on its future price,"" said president of Maradu Market Traders Association K G Antony.Antony, however, insisted that the price increase is presently confined to only a small basket of goods. ""But the dwindling labour in the agricultural sector in Tamil Nadu and other major vegetable-growing states is cause for concern, as they are migrating to employee guarantee schemes introduced by the central government which pay much higher,"" Antony said.Traders underscore that the troika of growing labour shortage, power crunch and high fuel costs will be the long-term threats. ""These are modifiable factors, unlike scanty rainfall or dry weather, but they defy any quick solution,"" traders said. These will be the real concerns going ahead."
162,Food prices double in UPA’s term,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Food-prices-double-in-UPAs-term/articleshow/13159457.cms,2012-05-16,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: If inflation has broken the back of the aam aadmi, the biggest contributor to the pain in the UPA's term is food prices.Government data on wholesale price index (WPI) shows that there has been a 63% increase in the price of all commodities between April 2004, a month before UPA took charge, and April 2012, the latest period for which data is available. But when it comes to food products, the index has more than doubled from 98 to 206.4. So, you are now spending at least twice the amount you spent in April 2004 just to meet your basic consumption needs.Of the 60-odd items analyzed by TOI and Crisil, there is just one case  ginger  where the price has decreased, going by the index. In all other cases, there has been an increase. Within these commodities, there are only eight products  guava, coconut, garlic, papaya, onions, turmeric, tea and chicken  where the rise in prices is less than 63%.The spurt in food prices is mainly due to demand outstripping supply as productivity has remained stagnant for most of the commodities.For households, especially the poor, food inflation can have the most damaging impact, given that a bulk of spending in the lower income strata is on this segment. While the poor can draw some comfort from the fact that cereal prices are not among the commodities which have seen the maximum jump, the overall increase is still over 90% with wheat and rice, on an average, seeing over 80% increase.While protein-rich items such as milk, egg, meat and fish have seen prices more than double, it is vegetables that have caused the maximum dent to the housewife's monthly budget. This segment has seen a 171% jump. So, if you spent Rs 3,000 a month on vegetables seven years ago, you would now be spending over Rs 5,000. Given that cabbage now costs six-and-a-half times more than April 2004, you can draw comfort from the fact that during this period, potato and brinjal prices have only gone up by 111% and 140%, respectively. Similarly, bhindi now costs four-and-a-half times more.Even fruits have seen a lower spurt of around 90% with prices of mangoes, oranges, apples and pineapple more than doubling. When it comes to spices, black pepper has seen the biggest jump (335%). Coffee makes up the top five commodities in terms of price rise with an increase of 269%."

They have been specifically asked to incorporate the clause that only non-lethal cargo will be transported. This has been specified by Parliament in its guidelines for re-engagement with the U.S./NATO.The DCC also asked the Foreign Ministry to remain engaged with the U.S. on other recommendations of Parliament including securing an apology from the U.S. for the Salala incident and cessation of drone attacks. The supply lines were shut down in November-end after NATO helicopters attacked Pakistan Army outposts in the Mohmand tribal agency along the border with Afghanistan killing 24 soldiers.Pakistan is hoping to extract a bigger price from NATO for the transit facility which was provided free for the first 10 years since the war on terror began. Regular terrorist attacks on NATO trucks had resulted in the coalition forces transporting a bulk of their shipment required in Afghanistan via the Northern Distribution Network  logistical arrangements connecting the Baltic and Caspian ports with Afghanistan via Russia, Central Asia and the Caucasus. But the GLOC through Pakistan is a cheaper alternative."

168,"Sambar,extra tangy please",http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sambar-extra-tangy-please/,2012-05-21,Indian Express,"Can the idli-vada-dosa chain take on the MNC?At Bangalore fast food chain Vasudev Adigas,a wholesome meal of two fluffy idlis and a crunchy vada served with chutney and tangy sambar costs less than Rs 40. As evidence of its ample popularity,its clientele spans several socio-economic groups. Men and women in business clothing throng its air-conditioned outlet by the metro station on MG Road. A middle class crowd mills about the self-service stations in the congested Majestic Area outlet.Competition is ferocious. In each of the neighbourhoods that Adigas serves,several multinational chains woo diners aggressively. Round the corner from Adigas MG Road outlet,McDonalds offers a burger,coke and fries lunch in a Rs 55 Super Lunch deal. Across the street is a KFC outlet,whose ads press young Indians to hang out at the chain with friends. A few steps away is an outlet of Subway,whose parent company has just announced that it will have 1,000 stores in India by 2015. Now,the idli-vada-dosa chain has to take on the multinationals by marrying the artisanal quality of its south Indian recipes with the slick formats of the multinationals. Very few  Chennais Saravana Bhavan is one  have dared.It is not going to be easy. In a city blanketed by foreign fast-food chains,Adigas has a mere 15 outlets. Its owner Vasudeva Adigas ancestors trace back to the west coast where the Udupi and Darshini restaurants originated. Adiga founded the chain in 1994,inspired by the success of his parents Brahmins Coffee Bar situated in the charming Shankarapuram area. That tiny roadside eatery has a menu five items long,but crowds pack the pavement outside.Adiga,armed with the recipe book borrowed from his mother,has chalked up a plan: he wants to grow his chain quickly,take it beyond Bangalore and touch a hundred outlets. That is no mean task. South Indian fast food,by definition,defies standardisation. For generations,instinct and experience have guided the cooks who prepare the dosa batter and sambar mix.But a determined Adiga wants his brand in Indias metros by 2018. He wants the Adigas sign to beckon travellers on major highways,though McDonalds and KFC have already preceded him there. So,conquering his twin fears of losing control and of outsiders meddling in his business,Adiga has brought in venture capital (Mumbai-based New Silk Route has invested in the chain.)South Indias idli-vada-dosa restaurants have remained largely standalone or single-city brands. Their owners ambitions have been thwarted by the challenges of standardising recipes and sourcing ingredients. For example,the dosa batter,a ground mixture of dal and rice,depends on such variables as the quality of water,grinding time and fermenting time,besides the quality of the dal and rice.The Adigas chain handles its share of challenges: at the Kannada Sammelana last year,Vasudev Adiga provided breakfast lunch and dinner for 1,00,000 attendees. Its catering unit is a well-recognised lunchtime brand at multinationals cafeteria in Bangalore,supplying some 50,000 lunches daily. Its food was relished by guests at the wedding of Infosys co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthys son to TVS heir Lakshmi Venu.But all that cannot see him through the risks of expanding countrywide,acknowledges Adiga. He is hiring a chief operating officer to take charge of the expansion. The chain is corporatising on many others levels. Like the multinationals,all sourcing will be centralised,except for perishables like vegetables and milk. The back-end will be automated by bringing in industrial-style machines to chop vegetables and wash dishes. Just like the MNC chains,which get outside agencies to dice the potatoes just so,Adigas too wants to outsource such tasks.On their part,the multinationals have learned that India is a price-sensitive market. Their offerings now start at Rs 20. They have tweaked and Indianised their menu,and included many offerings targeted at vegetarians. They give many south Indian idli-vada-dosa darshinis,as the stand-and-eat restaurants are popularly called,a stiff fight.Adiga,however,hopes his chain will prevail amongst discerning diners. Indians may tire of the assembly-line items of the multinationals but the fresh wholesomeness of Adigas south Indian food has enduring appeal, he says.Surveying the scene one morning at the stand-and-eat counter at his MG Road outlet,his swankiest yet,Adiga acknowledges that there are some things a south Indian chain will find hard to copy from the multinationals. Hi,Sir! he cheerily imitates the service at MNC fast-food chains as he glances at the poker-faced cashier doling out coupons to customers. Good mornings begin with two idlis and a vada, he says,borrowing from a retail food giants tagline.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A review of retail prices of everyday food items in Mumbai shows that several of them have almost doubled over the last four years. While milk cost Rs 24 per litre in 2008, the price today stands at Rs 52. Even the cost of potato has risen from Rs 8-10 per kg to Rs 15-18 in under 5 years.No wonder then, many average Mumbaikars are struggling to keep the kitchen running as before. ""Consumers are paying 100% more for most items than they did three or four years ago. The prices of sugar, sunflower oil have shot up. Common vegetables sold for 25-30 per kg, now cost Rs 60-80,"" says Shama Shaikh, a homemaker from Jogeshwari. The commerce ministry on Monday said vegetable prices shot up 60.97% in April compared to a 30.57% rise in March.The price pinch runs deeper though, it appears. Black pepper, which cost Rs 25-30 per 100 gm in 2008, now costs Rs 60. Turmeric that was steady at Rs 14 per 100 gm hit an all-time high of Rs 34 before settling at Rs 28.Red chilly is the new scorcher at Rs 32 per 100 gm, having risen from Rs 14-15. Cumin seeds remained steady at Rs 15 before escalating skyward to Rs 32 per 100 gm.Vinod Nair, a Vashi-based software engineer, says, ""I hope policy wonks in the government realize that price rise on any front has a domino effect. If my food bill increases, the funds left for everything else shrink correspondingly. My salary, after all, is not a bottomless pit.""The helplessness is echoed by Sharmila Ghosh, a general practitioner living in Andheri. ""Vegetable prices burn a hole every month in my pocket. Where I live, capsium costs Rs 40 per kg; not very long ago, the rate was around Rs 15,"" she says.The public anger also sprouts from the seeming apathy of the government. Francis Fernandes, a salesperson living in Mulund, points out that a news channel was broadcasting images of farmers spreading out foodgrain stocks in a crematorium for want of storage space on Mondaythe same day, the commerce ministry put out double-digit figures of 10.49% for food inflation."

They staged a protest under the banner of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene demanding immediate hike.Earlier, JD(S) leader and MLA H D Revanna has urged the government to fix Rs 7,500 per quintal of copra and begin procuring the same immediately.Addressing a press meet in Hassan recently, he said the party had already stressed the government to purchase copra through Nafed centres. Responding to the same, the government has already released Rs one crore.But the current market rate is causing huge losses for the farmers. Revanna said he would take a farmers delegation to the chief minister and would impress upon him to fix suitable price for the copra.The Centre has announced Rs 5,300 support price for the copra, similarly the state government too should also announce support price of Rs 2,200 and fix Rs 7,500 per quintal.The chief minister would be explained about the same, he said.Procurement of turmeric has already begun in three district centres. The government has announced support price and has released Rs five crore. Procurement process should be similar to ginger also, Revanna stressed.A new system has been implemented for seed potatoes in the district this year, which has been adopted successfully. The system should be in place till the stock in the cold storage units are exhausted, he stressed. He also sought a subsidy of 75 per cent for the potato seeds from the government.ProbeCommenting on the brutal attack on S P Mahantesh, which claimed his life, Revanna alleged it to be the handiwork of land mafia and demanded a high-level probe into the issue.He said that when Kumaraswamy was the chief minister, he had ordered to conduct a CoD probe on the Housing society scam. But later it was buried by vested interests. Mahantesh met his end for taking up a probe on the issue, he alleged."

Such substandard potatoes are not found in markets of other urban centres of the State like Puri, Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Balasore. At other places potatoes sold in market are clean and are of better quality.Even traders agree that the low grade potatoes that are being sold in Berhampur would have no takers in other urban centres of Odisha. Any new visitor to the city can easily mark out this difference in quality of potatoes.The irony is that this low grade potato is being sold in Berhampur at the price of good quality potato sold in other places. At present wholesale price of potatoes in Berhampur is Rs 11 per kilogram and in retail counters it is sold for Rs 13-14 per kilogram. Krushna Behera, a rickshaw puller from Nayagarh working in the city said potato is the only affordable vegetable for the poor but in Berhampur it is also of low grade.As per housewives each kilogram of low grade potatoes sold in Berhampur at times has 100 grams of clay and other materials covering them. This substandard potato stock is reaching the city from West Bengal.According to sources this substandard stock contains a large number of potatoes that are deformed, partly rotten or have unhealthy colouration.These potatoes are marketed by covering the deformities using very fine clay named Ela Mitti'. Some times cheap synthetic colours are also being used for the purpose. Unless these potatoes are cleaned properly this clay and synthetic colour can be harmful for the consumers, said P. Dash, a housewife.Several times in the past administration held meetings to have a check on rise of potato prices. But till now no measures have been initiated to control the quality of potatoes sold in the city.Even traders admit that low-grade commodity is being sold in BerhampurIt is being sold at the price of good quality potato found in other urban centres of the State"

The reasons ranged from the extremely-high margins being charged by middlemen and the drought in some parts of Tamil Nadu. Despite the shortage, farmers were not getting a good price for vegetables and fruits, since middlemen were taking a high margin. A few retailers too unilaterally increased the price of vegetables, causing heartburn to consumers. Excise minister K. Babu inaugurated the Bazaar.Apart from Ernakulam, the VFPCK's big vegetable bazaar would function at Thiruvananthapuram. There would also be 25 retail outlets across the State, selling vegetables at a fair price. Most of the produce was procured directly from the agency's self-help groups.Apart from various vegetables, pineapple too is available at the bazaars and outlets, for Rs 16.80 a kg. The following is the price of a few vegetables  beans (Rs 28 per kg), beet root (Rs 18.20), banana (nendran  Rs 33.60), drum stick (Rs 16.80), potato (Rs 16.80) and onion (Rs 15.40).

A large stock of vegetables was lying in the markets with no takers, while neighbourhood vegetable shops faced shortage.The price differences at the wholesale and retail markets were stark. Beans, sold at Rs 28-a-kilo at Koyambedu on Tuesday, was priced at Rs 80 at neighbourhood shops. Potatoes , which had few takers at Koyambedu at Rs 15 per kilo, was priced at Rs 44 in the retail market.At the Koyambedu market, prices of most vegetables crashed further after noon. A large number of lorries were parked near the market and at petrol pumps in the vicinity, waiting for diesel.Wholesale traders were worried that if the situation continues for another day they would suffer huge loses. R Soundararajan, former member of Koyambedu market management committee said many vegetable vendors found it either impossible or unprofitable to come to the wholesale market since diesel was not available. ""Imagine a small trader from Velachery who buys vegetables in the wholesale for Rs 5,000. After paying double the price for diesel, he may not make a good profit,"" he said.Homemakers were worried, too. Said Lourdes Rose, a homemaker in, ""The last few days have been tough. First it was the diesel shortage, now its petrol and prices of vegetables."" Wholesale traders said retail majors who managed to send vehicles to Koyambedu were buying from them at wholesale prices and packaging the veggies and selling them at a profit of not less than Rs 10.Prices of chicken have also gone up in the last few days, from Rs140 a kilo last week to Rs160 now, as lesser number of trucks carrying the birds have been coming from the poultry farms in Namakkal and other parts of the state."
178,Madhyamik’s fighter five script success ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120601/jsp/calcutta/story_15546049.jsp,2012-06-01,Telegraph,"A leaking roof, hours of toiling on the field and absence of a computer couldnt stop these Madhyamik examinees from finding their place in the sun. Metro salutes them for their sheer grit Joydeep Bala A one-room house with an asbestos roof that makes it stifling in summer is where Joydeep Bala would study for hours while his mother cooked in a corner of the same room. But Joydeep never complained  if anything, the constraints only made the 15-year-old strive that much harder. Earlier, our house had a tiled roof and it would leak during monsoon, now at least that has stopped, said the student of Jodhpur Park Boys, who scored 598 in Madhyamik with a 100 in mathematics. Son of a carpenter, Joydeep refuses to take credit for his success. I have only studied but my parents have struggled for me, he said. Joydeeps father, Nihar Ranjan Bala, had to quit studies because of family responsibilities, but he is determined to make sure his son doesnt have to do the same. My husband studied till Class XI, but he wants his son to complete his studies and have a decent calling in life so that he does not have to undergo hardships like his father, said mother Jharna, a homemaker, who would much rather buy her son a book than get herself a new sari. There have been times when we have sacrificed our needs, said Jharna whose husband earns around Rs 3,000 a month. Joydeeps parents werent the only ones burying their wishes. He never even demanded a new T-shirt for Durga Puja, said Nihar. If Joydeeps result has brought joy to the family, it has brought a new worry  how to pay for the boys studies in the science stream. Nesar Khaled If vacations mean heading for a hill station or a beach town for many students, for Nesar Khaled it meant going off to his village to help his father on the field. Nesars father, a potato farmer at Bamungram in Malda, earns around Rs 2,000 but that is hardly enough to feed a family of five. He toils all day in the scorching summer sun but he does not want me to be a farmer like him. Instead, he sent me to the Khalatpur centre of Al-Ameen Mission in Howrah, so that I could make a career for myself. The least I can do is to help him during my vacations. The days I help him, he finishes his work a little earlier, said the 16-year-old student of Kakra High School in Howrah who has notched up a total of 628 in Madhyamik. The boy, who was admitted to Al-Ameen Mission three years ago, dreams of studying engineering from IIT. I want to be a software engineer. But it is a long way ahead, Nesar said. Farhin Shabnam A score of 640 has failed to satisfy Farhin Shabnam, who is intent on fulfilling his father dream by becoming a cardiologist. Sayadul Islam, a tuition teacher with a monthly income of Rs 3,500-4,000, could not study beyond graduation because of financial constraints but wants his daughter to chart a different course. I completed my graduation with accountancy honours and took admission in Calcutta University for postgraduation. But I had to quit midway because of financial problems and have since been working as a tuition teacher, Sayadul said. I want to see my children make it big and I have never differentiated between my son and daughters. Sayadul admitted his daughter to Al-Ameen Mission though he has been struggling to pay the fee. There have been several occasions when I have failed to pay the fee and it has been waived, he said. Farhin, who scored 97 in maths and physical science and 93 in life science, often could not buy textbooks but never complained. Why should I? I borrowed books from my friends or from the library. My father is doing so much for me, she said. Avirup Datta Avirup and his mother Srinanda Dattas struggle began around five years ago, when his father succumbed to brain tumour. Avirup was then in Class V. Avirups father owned a business in mechanical parts but had to sell it off because of his illness. He underwent two operations and suffered for around a year before losing the battle in 2007. But mother and son never gave up. The school took care of his fee, books and uniform, said Srinanda. But I have had to be very careful of how and on what I spend on. The student of Ramakrishna Mission, Baranagar, has scored 560 in Madhyamik and his mother is now worried about the future. I want to admit him to a government school near my house in Bagbazar so that there is not much expense in commuting, said Srinanda, adding that her son never makes any demands. His friends have computers at home but never has he asked me for one or shown any grievance about not having one. Anindya Shankar Das Debdas Das sells potatoes and onions and his wife Alo works in a beauty parlour. Together, they dream of a bright academic career for their son. Anindya Shankar Das has surely done his parents proud by scoring 561 in Madhyamik. I am a vegetable vendor but I have tried my best to support my son, said Debdas Das, a resident of Sinthee. Anindyas parents are grateful to Ramakrishna Mission, Baranagar, where he studied for waiving the fee and giving the boy a stipend. It was difficult to pool in money for his tuitions. We had to seek help from our relatives, said Alo. The couples monthly income works out to around Rs 3,000. My priority is to get him established in life, so that he does not have to struggle. That is my duty as a parent and I do not expect anything in return, said Alo."

Traders say there is likely to be a rise in demand as parents tend to buy vegetables daily once schools opens to ensure that their children have a healthy diet.The spurt in demand is expected increase vegetable prices by an average of 30% at Koyambedu Wholesale Market in the coming week. With the hostels at colleges and residential schools also reopening, the demand for vegetables will increase further and drive up prices too. Retail prices of all vegetables are at least Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg higher than at the Koyambedu market. Department stores like Spencer's and Reliance Fresh sell all vegetables at prices between Rs 12 and Rs 15 higher than at the wholesale market. At Koyembedu, the price of beans is now Rs 40 a kg and carrot is Rs 30 a kg.""We are trying to keep the prices of vegetables stable despite a widening gap between demand and supply,"" said R Soundararajan, a wholesale dealer and former member of Koyembedu Market Management Committee.People in the city are struggling to budget for their needs, ""Chennai is becoming a very costly city,"" said S Krishnan, a resident of Nanganallur.Though the demand is set to rise, supply has not increased. Lack of summer showers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the major vegetable suppliers to the city, has hit the supply. Karnataka contributes around 70% of all vegetables, including carrot, beans and ginger, supplied to the city. With limited stocks, most vegetable suppliers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh prefer to sell the vegetables to Kerala for higher prices even though Chennai is a closer destination.Tamil Nadu only produces adequate tomatoes to meet the city's needs. Onions are brought to Chennai from Maharashtra and potatoes from Uttar Pradesh."

Reduced cultivation, unfavourable climatic conditions and water scarcity continue to nag both farmers and consumers.Around 800 quintals of vegetables used to arrive at MVP Rythu Bazar every day but the quantity has come down to 600 quintals. Fruits like mangoes and jackfruits are also included along with the vegetables.In Seethammadhara rythu bazar, the arrivals have dropped from 800 quintals to 700 quintals and there was drop of 30 per cent at Narasimha Nagar Rythu Bazar.Prices of vegetables have gone up. One bundle of coriander leaf costs Rs.6, potatoes is priced at Rs.19 per kilo gram in Rythu Bazars and the same is sold at Rs.25 in retail markets.Beans, brinjal, capsicum, bottle-gourd and bitter-gourd were costly these days, said estate officer of Seethammadhara Rythu Bazar Ch. Krishna Murthy.Wholesale traders in Poorna Market said unfavourable climatic condition and shortage of water led to low yield of crops.Consequently the supply has come down and there is also an approximate hike of 20 per cent in the price of almost all the vegetables.The situation would continue for the entire month unless the temperature comes down, said estate officer of MVP Rythu Bazar Prasad Gokada.Water scarcityPower and water scarcity are also owing to the low yield of crops, said a farmer K. Surya Narayana. Crops need more water during summer and on top of that we don't have power supply at our place, Marrivalasa, he lamented.He is struggling to get power connection both at home and farm for the last five years but was not successful. I have applied for the connection but no action was taken by the officials, added the farmer.Several consumers make do with vegetables like ribbed-gourd and ivy-gourd which are priced nominally. Others are forced to buy common varieties which are of low quality by paying double the price at the Rythu Bazars. Some are checking out alternatives like soya chunks, eggs, rajma, chickpeas and other pulses.A visitor at Narasimha Nagar Rythu Bazaar Neelaveni Reddy cribbed about the choice of green leafy vegetables available.Owing to fewer arrivals in the market, the choice is less and we need to pay almost double the price for the meagre quality, she said.As a matter of fact, mangoes are seen more at rythu bazars than vegetables."

Willi Haueter,executive chef at The Imperial,Delhi adds,A conscious effort to include more greens in the daily diet is not so difficult. As the healthy eating pendulum swings towards concepts like life-time commitment to vegetarianism,organic foods and nutritious,balanced diets (balanced with greens not with starvation),for staving off numerous lifestyle problems,here is an easy to implement guide that could help alter your daily menu.The Raw FilesEat one raw meal a day. It is the best service you can do to yourself. Create it with nine ingredients that should include tomatoes,beans (boiled or semi-boiled),green and yellow capsicum,green peas,broccoli heads,spinach,boiled tomatoes. If you must add a cooked bit to it,try boiled kidney beans (rajma) or chhole and add seasonal fruits like watermelon,grapes,musk melon or pineapple to the riot. The flavours will form a tasty blend. A raw meal is accessible,convenient,budget-sensitive,toxin-free and good to push your daily green agenda. It is high in dietary fibre,iron and calcium phytochemicals,Vitamin C,carotenoids,lutein,folate,magnesium as well as Vitamin K, asserts Mehrotra.Experiment,Minus the FussSlow cook greens with minimum fuss to retain their goodness. Green salads need not be bland but the trick is to keep them crisp and light,steamed and sauteed, advises Haueter of The Imperial. To mark World Environment Day recently,the hotel organised a Green Luncheon,as part of their many eco-initiatives. The Chef recommends beetroot and pumpkin in meals to break the monotony. Lightly cooked spinach with garlic and soy sauce isnt just delicious but is high in nutrition. Incidentally,spinach can be grown in home gardens watered by recycled or sewage water without harming its organic value. Haueter rates Thai and Vietnamese cuisines as the healthiest choices when dining out.Puree Them,Gobble ThemAdd greens to your purees or as finely chopped companions to favourites like potatoes and onions. Options: spinach puree with onions,the puree of sweet gourd with sauteed potatoes spiked with fresh pomegranate seeds,sun-dried mint in raitas or mango pannas and dried mustard leaves in gravies.Where Are My Greens From?American journalist and author of The Omnivores Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals,Michael Pollan suggests that people must make it a basic point to find out where their greens come from and how theyre grown. Indian chefs too are beginning to subscribe to this practice. Says Chef Rajdeep Kapoor,executive chef of the ITC Maratha,Mumbai,Most of our ingredients come from a 100 km radius of Mumbai. We know the vendors were working with,how they grow their produce and the process in which its handled. If your greens come from farms with a three km radius of a river or the sea,in all likelihood they are not organic because pollutants from the sea enter deep into the soil and pollute the produce. The farther a farm from a sea or a river,the more organic is the produce.Seasonal Is SimpleInstead of including frozen or tinned greens,keep your meals seasonal. To eat healthy and be environmentally conscious,one must eat seasonally when fruits and vegetables are at their best and high in vitamins and iron, says Mumbai-based nutritionist Pooja Makhija. Choosing vegetables with protective layers like onions,potatoes,carrots and cucumbers is a good idea. Nutrients are lost between the harvest,transport and handling process. Vegetables with a protective layer,are the best options, she says.Green Add-onsAn often heard fact but worth repeating  if you can start your day with one green drink: wheat grass,amla or aloe vera juice and end it with cup of green tea,half the battle is won.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

It is high in dietary fibre,iron and calcium phytochemicals,Vitamin C,carotenoids,lutein,folate,magnesium as well as Vitamin K, asserts Mehrotra.Experiment,Minus the FussSlow cook greens with minimum fuss to retain their goodness. Green salads neednt be bland but the trick is to keep them crisp and light,steamed and sauteed, advises Haueter of The Imperial. To mark World Environment Day early this week,the hotel organised a Green Luncheon as part of its eco-initiatives. The chef recommends beetroot and pumpkin in meals to break the monotony. Lightly cooked spinach with garlic and soy sauce isnt just delicious but is also high in nutrition. Incidentally,spinach can be grown in home gardens,watered by recycled or sewage water,without harming its organic value. Haueter rates Thai and Vietnamese cuisines as the healthiest choices when dining out.Puree Them,Gobble ThemAdd greens to your meals as purees or as finely chopped companions to favourites such as potatoes and onions. Options: spinach puree with onions; the puree of sweet gourd with sauteed potatoes,spiked with fresh pomegranate seeds; liberal amount of sun-dried mint in raitas or mango pannas and dried mustard leaves in gravies.Where Are MyGreens From?American journalist and author of The Omnivores Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals,Michael Pollan suggests people must make it a basic point to find out where their greens come from and how theyre grown. Indian chefs,too,are beginning to subscribe to this practice. Says Chef Rajdeep Kapoor,executive chef,ITC Maratha,Mumbai,Most of our ingredients come from within a 100-km radius of Mumbai. We know vendors were working with and how they grow their produce,as also the process in which its handled. If your greens come from farms within a three-km radius of a river or the sea,in all likelihood they are not organic because pollutants from the sea enter deep into the soil and seep up in farming alongside. The farther a farm from a sea or a river,the more organic is the produce.Seasonal Is SimpleInstead of including frozen or tinned greens,keep your meals seasonal. To eat healthy and be environmentally conscious,one must eat seasonally,when fruits and vegetables are at their best and high in vitamins and iron, says Mumbai-based nutritionist Pooja Makhija. Choosing vegetables with protective layers such as onions,potatoes,carrots and cucumbers is a good idea. Nutrients are lost in harvesting,transport and handling processes. Vegetables with a protective layer (that can be peeled off before cooking),are the best options, she says.Green Add-onsAn oft-heard fact but worth repeating. If you can start your day with one green drink: wheat grass,amla or aloe vera juice and end it with cup of green tea,half the battle is won.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Ch. Vijaya BhaskarPrices of vegetables have skyrocketed beyond the reach of the commonman. On the face of soaring prices, the arrivals have come down drastically, leaving the commonman with no other choice but to restrict his consumption to a few vegetables like drumstick, tomatoes and leafy vegetables.The rythu bazaars, which are popular for their affordable prices, are also out of bound for the common man. The prices of all types of vegetables have suddenly soared for inexplicable reasons for last one week.The bitter gourd has almost disappeared from the markets. The snake gourd and raddish, is nowhere to be seen in Rythu Bazars.Not just the exotic beans and capsicum, but the relatively affordable brinjal, ivy gourd (donda kaya), ladies finger (benda kaya) are no more within the reach of majority of people. Brinjal, which normally sells for Rs.6 to Rs.7 per kg, now costs more than Rs.22.A bundle of coriander leaves which was selling at just at Rs.6 or Rs.8 is sold not less than Rs.15.A bottle gourd that cost Rs.5 just a week ago is now being sold for Rs.10; ridge gourd, which was just Rs.18 a kg, is now sold at Rs.22 a kg at rythu bazaar.The prices of beans have crossed Rs.60, while the capsicum is sold at Rs.38 a kg; keera is sold for Rs.20 as against the usual price of Rs.8 a kg  all recording a price jump of more than 150 per cent.The prices of onion and potatoes  basic ingredients in most Indian dishes  are, however, stable and being sold at Rs. 9 and Rs. 17 a kg respectively.The arrivals at Swaraj Maidan have come down by 600 to 700 quintals a day as against usual arrival of 2,700 quintals.The fall in arrivals include leafy vegetables also.Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazaar Estate Officer L.

""We are investing in innovation and technology and have over 50 new products at various stages of testing,"" he added.He said innovation is key to succeed in a cluttered market where more than a thousand brands - mostly small ones - fight it out. ""What stands out in this market will be scale and innovation which we need to play on,"" Vyas said.Frito-Lay, which has about 150 products or variants, launched 16 new pack sizes and variants in the last couple of months, displaying increased urgency and aggression despite signs of a consumer slowdown. The numbers don't include the Lehar brand.Frito-Lay seems unfazed by the slowdown in sales of consumer products, margin squeeze in industries due to rising food and fuel prices, and the Indian GDP growth rate slipping to its slowest in nine years in 2011-12.""We are very optimistic about the market as the potential is far more than we realise and that's the reason why the market is growing,"" Vyas said. The $65-billion US major has been mostly credited for the rapid expansion of the snacks market since it entered the segment in 1995, helping it grow 20% a year.When PepsiCo introduced Lays and Cheetos brands in 1995, there were only two large competitors - Haldiram's and Amrit Agro, which owned potato chips brand Uncle Chips that was later acquired by the US cola giant. PepsiCo's Kurkure - launched in 1999 -was a runaway success.While PepsiCo has grown its snacks business rapidly, it has been losing market share in recent years as several big players have entered the pitch. Frito-Lay today controls roughly half the market, down from more than three-fourths share five year ago.An official of a rival company said Frito-Lay will need several successful new products to maintain its growth rate. ""Frito-Lay has been growing at higher double digits till now. But, if they want to maintain similar growth trajectory of over 40%, they would require dozens of new products and variants to drive that,"" the person said, requesting anonymity.That is exactly what Frito-Lay hopes to do with new products and variants under core brands Lays and Kurkure as well as fighter brands Cheetos and Uncle Chips.Meanwhile, PepsiCo will use its Lehar brand to tackle regional snacks brands such as Balaji and Haldiram, which sell lower priced products. Pepsi wants to use Lehar - which is not endorsed by celebrities and have a lean operating structure - to increase sales in the hinterland.PepsiCo is also making a greater push into healthy snack options. Just last week, it expanded baked snack brand Aliva into six new variants, up from four variants being sold since 2009. The company also brought Aliva under Lays' endorsement to leverage the latter's strong recall in the market and roped in actress Vidya Balan as its brand ambassador.While PepsiCo is expanding rapidly, so is its competition. Biscuits makers Parle Products and Britannia, for example, are betting big on the snacks segment.""Most players, including Parle, want to tap the huge conversion that can happen from unbranded market into an organised one,"" Mayank Shah, group product manager at Parle Products, said.""Also, price points of Rs 5 and Rs 10 are adding to the convenience factor, which the unbranded or loose sellers can't match up,"" he added."
187,Price spike inflates worry,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120615/jsp/business/story_15613526.jsp,2012-06-15,Telegraph,"New Delhi, June 14: Costlier food items carried inflation up to 7.55 per cent in May, and the price situation could get aggravated further by the governments decision to raise the minimum support price of paddy, oil seeds and pulses. However, the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) deferred a decision to raise urea prices because of opposition by some ministries. Inflation in May last year stood at 9.56 per cent. Overall food inflation rose to 10.74 per cent in May from 10.49 per cent in the previous month. Food articles have a share of 14.3 per cent in the WPI basket. I am confident that the range of inflation will be around 6.5-7.5 per cent throughout the year. I hope if the monsoon is quite good, then it would be possible to sort out these pressures, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said. Potatoes turned costlier by 68.10 per cent compared with 53.44 per cent in April. Pulses and wheat turned expensive by 16.61 per cent and 6.81 per cent, respectively. Vegetable inflation stood at 49.43 per cent in May against 61 per cent in the previous month. Meanwhile, the government today sharply increased the minimum support price (MSP) purchase price of paddy, oilseeds and pulses for the ongoing kharif season. The proposal to hike urea prices by 10 per cent to Rs 5,841 per tonne for 2012-13 to reduce the subsidy burden was deferred keeping the interests of farmers in mind. The proposal has gone back to the ministry of fertilisers. They have to take a second look at it, home minister P. Chidambaram said after the meeting of the CCEA. Officials said the proposal had been opposed by some ministries as it would hit farmers already reeling under the impact of a sharp increase in the price of phosphatic and potassic fertilisers. The purchase price of paddy was hiked 16 per cent to Rs 1,250 per quintal, while that of pulses was raised 37 per cent to reduce the countrys dependence on imports. For grade A variety of paddy, the support price has been raised to Rs 1,280 per quintal from Rs 1,110. Chidambaram said the MSP of urad had been increased 30 per cent to Rs 4,300 per quintal for 2012-13 crop year (July-June) from Rs 3,300 per quintal in the previous year. The decision on the prices of key pulses such as tur and moong was deferred. In oilseeds, the price of soyabean has been fixed at Rs 2,200 per quintal for black and Rs 2,240 for yellow varieties, up by Rs 550 per quintal each from 2011-12. The price of groundnut (shell) has been raised 37 per cent to Rs 3,700 per quintal from Rs 2,700. The Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices, which recommends MSP after taking into account the cost of production, suggested a sharp increase in the price of pulses and oilseeds to boost domestic output. Higher MSP has been fixed not only to cover rising input costs but also provide better returns to farmers. The support price of medium-staple and long-staple cotton was increased up to 28 per cent to Rs 3,600 and 3,900 per quintal, respectively. There could be a possibility of inflation in rice. But the government has huge stock and it can intervene anytime to contain prices, Planning Commission member Abhijit Sen said. He said there was no reason to worry on account of pulses and oilseeds as their market prices were higher than their MSP. Officials said an increase in purchase prices would encourage farmers to sow more rice and other staples, thereby preventing food shortages. The country is targeting a bumper foodgrains harvest for the third year in a row."

189,Hassan: Special package to help potato growers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/258467/hassan-special-package-help-potato.html,2012-06-20,Deccan Herald,"Hassan: Special package to help potato growersHassan, June 20, 2012, DHNS: 22:51 ISTThe drought review meeting presided over by the district-in-charge secretary Kumar Naik discussed various issues pertaining to steps to be taken owing to failure of monsoon and agricultural activities taken up in Hassan district.Agricultural officer B Shivaraju said that delay in monsoon and inadequate rainfall in the district may result in less yield this year.Speaking at the meeting, he said while the district experienced pre-monsoon rains which were over the norm in the month of April; only 1/3rd of rainfall was received in the month of June. Sowing was carried out in 35,000 hectares last year and this year it has increased to around 48,000 hectares.Majority of sowing was done at Arsikere, Channaryapatna and Holenarasipur. But, with no rains subsequently, the crops have started wilting. A proposal has been submitted to the deputy commissioner seeking Rs 20 crore compensation for crop loss, Shivaraju said.If the same situation continues, the crop loss is estimated to be around Rs 50 to 60 crore.Apart from this, the rising prices of fertilisers has caused worry among the peasants, hepointed out.Replying to this Kumar Naik, directed the officials to create awareness among the farmers to use organic manure to tackle the problem.Shakeel Ahmed of Horticulture department said that potato has been sown in 15 hectares, less by five hectares compared to previous year. Crops at 8,000 acres of land has been destroyed due to lack of rain. Ginger too is 50 per cent less this year. As farmers are inclining towards growing maize, ragi and paddy it is necessary to see that there is no shortage in supply of seeds.Deputy commissioner Mohanraj took Cesc officials to task for their negligence and directed them to supply power to pumpsets providing drinking water. The problems have arised due to shortage in transformer repairing units, which has also led to the farmers getting illegal connections, said Cesc official.Though there are repair centres at Hassan, Arsikere, Holenarasipur and Channarayapatna, repair works are being done only at the centre in Channarayapatna, he said. He also appealed to the DC and district-in-charge secretary to release Rs two crore fund for the same.PWD officer explained that there is enough funds to tackle drought relief. The department has been given approval for 238 works. Out of 51 projects in Hassan, 40 have been completed. Similarly, 106 projects are over out of 155, he added.Helping handThe government has announced a special package for potato growers in view of insufficient rainfall. Rs 5,000 per hectare and support prices in various forms would be provided for the farmers, said Shakeel Ahmed.Along with seeds, pesticides worth Rs 1,000 is distributed. Each farmer with minimum two hectares will be covered under crop insurance and Rs 1,500 per hectare would be given to purchase organic manure, said the officer."

Land has been identified at 92 other blocks in the State to set up cold storages.While there have been reports of an agrarian crisis in the State where farmers have been denied the minimum support price for their produce, Ms. Banerjee had announced setting up of a cold storages and kisan mandis (farmers markets) in every block to increase their earnings.Stating that 35-40 per cent vegetables produced in the State every year perish for lack of storage facility, Mr. Roy said cold storages are being set up on the basis of public-private partnership where the State Government will provide land and the private party will invest necessary funds. However, he denied any crisis facing potato farmers in Dakshin Dinajpur district where because of increased production of the crop farmers reportedly are unable to store their produce and are forced into distress selling.Asked about steps to ensure cheap seeds to farmers for crops like potato, Mr. Roy said the Government is trying to revive a seed institute located at Kalimpong in Darjeeling district. He said the department has approached the Union Agriculture Ministry which has promised to send a team of scientists to revive the seed institute so that high quality seeds can be made available to farmers from the State."
191,A wishlist for reform,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/a-wishlist-for-reform/,2012-06-22,Indian Express,"For one,FDI in multibrand retail stands as a missed opportunityInertia has bogged us down for the past one year or so. Few would doubt that we have wasted our energies in this period. Its time for us to do what we ought to be doing. Its time for us to unlock our national energy yet again.On the economic front we seem to be losing momentum at just the wrong time. Over the next 10 years,we need to create 10 million new jobs every year just to cater to the tsunami of expected entrants in the job market. Add to this the challenge of lifting millions of people out of poverty. We cannot afford to have an appetite for mediocre growth. We need to get back on a high-growth trajectory fast.Before talking about turning things around,let us first understand how bad the situation is. The GDP growth rate of 5.3 per cent in the last quarter of 2011-12 is the slowest since 2003-04. The industrial output growth is down to 0.1 per cent  a figure that may add to inflationary pressures,given the constrained demand-supply situation. Rupee valuations,sentiments on Dalal Street and evaluations of rating agencies are all heading south. Externally,a deepening eurozone crisis continues to trouble us.However,not everything is bad on the economic front. India continues to be a high savings and investment country. Our investment rate of 35 per cent is still encouraging. The FDI inflow of $46.85 billion in 2011-12 is higher than the previous highest of $41.9 billion in 2008-09. Export to GDP ratio has grown steadily at an average of 22 per cent a year since 2004-05. UPA 1 and UPA 2 have sustained an annual growth rate of 8.2 per cent from 2004-05 to 2011-12 and survived two major global downturns,indicating a model that did work till recently. There is no reason why we cant evolve our model to meet the challenges of the future as well.On balance,we need to realise that the current slowdown is a challenge but one that can be met. Exactly how are we going to do it? The need of the hour is for us to act strongly and quickly. Let me outline my small wish list for starters.One,FDI in multibrand retail stands as a missed opportunity. It was aimed at making our distribution systems more efficient and reducing the number of intermediaries in the retail chain,thereby providing better prices for farmers and cheaper goods for consumers.Today,on the one hand,we grapple with stubborn food inflation and,on the other,we let 35-40 per cent of fruit and vegetable produce,and nearly 10 per cent of foodgrains,go to waste due to inefficiencies in the supply chain. Across the world,nations have minimised food wastage by encouraging private investment and reforms in supply chains. We have the opportunity to cherry-pick models that suit our needs,something the FDI policy was aiming to do.Spare a thought for the Indian farmer as well,who,on an average,nets less than one-third of the total price paid at retail by consumers. A World Bank study showed that the average price a farmer receives for horticulture produce is barely 15 per cent of what is paid at retail. We need to provide a better deal for farmers. Apart from plugging wastages and helping farmers,this key policy intervention is likely to benefit local manufacturers. The end consumer will be the biggest beneficiary.Yet,the move was a non-starter. The question is: did we,as a nation,evaluate the issue on merit? Do we want a more efficient system where everyone wins? Or do we want the farmer from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to dump potatoes while the consumer in Kerala pays dearly for the same?Two,the mining sector has become associated with scams and environmental hazards so we have had no hesitation in throwing the baby out with the bathwater  pushing it into a negative growth,of -2.7 per cent in 2011. In contrast,countries like South Africa,Australia and Brazil have become stronger in the midst of recession due to the growth in their mining sectors. These nations,coincidentally,are the ones that strove to achieve optimal balance between responsible mining and environmental concerns.India has 267 billion tonnes of coal reserves  one of the highest in the world  still the demand-supply gap is likely to touch 142 MT this year,leading to power units shutting down this summer due to low coal supply,investment in power sector drying up and high imports driving up the account deficit. When the government tries to fix the situation,it is accused of causing windfalls to private and state-owned companies and the word coalgate finds its way into the political lexicon.The story does not stop with coal or iron ore. In my state, Haryana,a stalemate between the courts,ministry of environment and forests and the state government has ensured a complete ban on mining of minor minerals (stone,gravel etc) since 2010 on account of the environmental clearance policy and its judicial interpretation. This means construction material costs three to four times more,leading to the delay or abandonment of critical infrastructure projects like highways and pushing up the cost of building houses. Every stalemate like this bleeds our economy bit by bit.While it has become fashionable to criticise mining,we need to realise that we cannot have roads,power or housing without controlled mining. We need to create transparent policies that strike a balance between mining and environmental concerns. We can start by reforming our mining and environment policy framework.Three,the law-making process has to be expedited,since many important legislations are stuck in the pipeline. Apart from letting Parliament function,the Opposition sometimes needs to take a more apolitical view of legislations in the national interest.As parliamentarians,we can set the ball rolling by calling an unprecedented long monsoon session to clear most of our pending legislations. Imagine the kind of signal that will send out. Our people need us to act firmly at this moment. Are we ready?Four,enact the land acquisition bill. The law was brought in to ensure that industry got land without disputes and farmers got a fair price. The delay in the passage of a balanced bill has contributed to industrial slowdown since land acquisition for many projects is held up.Apart from these,we need to bring in FDI in civil aviation and privatise Air India so that it does not become a drain on national resources. We also need to restart the debate on the rationalisation of labour laws. And we need to do so much more.While we can blame the government,some amount of responsibility for this pervasive negativity lies with each one of us also. The lokpal bill should be passed and the corrupt should be in jail. But we also need to ration the attention towards cynics and naysayers. Lets get our focus back. Lets have a good breakfast and get back to work. India needs to move on.The writer is a Congress MPexpress@expressindia.comFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Its little surprise then that the recently opened Park Plaza Chandigarh decided to first get rolling its specialty restaurant,The Oriental Blossom,even before the launch of its other popular property,Geoffreys,that is keenly awaited.The 60-cover Oriental Blossom follows an Oriental restaurant blueprint to the T. Chinese symbols mark the doors and the bamboo-orchid floral dcor follows you all through the restaurant. Its a delight to hear the soothing piped Oriental music. Given how another popular restaurant across the town swapped the playlist due to popular demand,we sincerely hope the Blossom stays true to its theme.Since its a fine diner,theres a conscious attempt to keep all the table placements fairly private,which is a good thing. Impressed with the ambience,we eagerly ask for the menu. Theres a clear aim to impress the Chandigarh diner,who has many Oriental options to choose from,as the menu opens to an exhaustive list of appetizers. Lobster,Tiger prawn,pomfret,squid et al bring in plenty of options in the starters line-up. Starting with kimchi (salad) and five-spice peanuts,both served complimentary,we tuck into Jade rolls (Rs 325). The rolls packed in spinach and shredded vegetable filling topped with hot garlic sauce are a welcome change from spring rolls.As with most places,non-vegetarians rarely have reason to complain when it comes to variety. For the vegetarian diner,the Blossom tries a little harder. The fiery Potato Crisp,fried and tossed with chilly and spring onions,was a lip-smacker. Though not really the season to enjoy hot soups,we would still recommend the Chimney Soup,a specialty on offer. Though its meant to serve two,it would be enough for four moderately hungry adults too. For Rs 350,one can choose between seafood,chicken or vegetable options. The chicken soup came in a chimney shaped pot that retains its heat on the table too. The flavours were spot-on.The main course line-up is long and diners are bound to find what appeals to them eventually. The Cantonese Style Roast Chicken (Rs 625),however,was too dry and stringy for our liking. The fish in chilly black bean sauce (Rs 575) paired with Hakka noodles (Rs 275) was a complete meal in itself. A vegetarian palate pleaser here (and a delight,really) is the stuffed tofu in chilly garlic sauce (Rs 375) that was soft,and the tofu tasted less than an hour old. The desserts dont throw any bouncers with Oriental staples like Banana toffee with ice cream,date pancakes and honey tossed noodles. The Oriental Blossom also offers set menus for larger groups of eight and more,with prices starting at Rs 500. We recommend you find your own favourites here.Meal for two: Rs 1,500 (excluding taxes)Location: Park Plaza,Block No.10,Sector 17A,ChandigarhContact: 6600000?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The potato growers in the district are forced to sell seeds for half the price they purchased it, suffering a huge loss even before the cultivation began.Ironically, the rush that was witnessed during the purchase of seeds a few weeks ago was missing during the resale now.The farmers had procured the potato seeds from the traders in Punjab and other parts of North India paying an exorbitant price of Rs 1,300 per quintal which was mere Rs 600 - Rs 800 a quintal last year in the corresponding period.The farmers in large number bought the potato seeds, relying on weathermens predictions that the rain would be normal this year.Besides, the rain in April also had triggered their hope to reap good yield after a gap of five years. Such was the rush that the policemen were deployed to manage the crowd at the purchase centre in the APMC yard in Hassan. The farmers had bought pesticides and insecticides even before sowing activities began.Encouraged by the cloudy weather, they ploughed the field. Some of them completed the sowing too, expecting the rain that didnt come.Disappointed over the delay in the onset of monsoon, the farmers, who had not yet sown the seeds brought them back to the APMC yard for reselling. The seeds which cost them nearly Rs 13 per kg were sold at Rs five - Rs six, causing a loss of Rs 800 per quintal.The officials said potato seeds were sown on 15,000 hectares of land and the crops on over 8,000 hectares have withered."

They are selling seeds for Rs. 5 to Rs. 6 a kg. Merchants at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee yard here said many farmers were seen selling seeds to vegetable vendors. Farmers, particularly those in rain-fed areas, have lost hopes of getting any yield this year. They sold seeds to us, Tammannaiah, a merchant, said.They bought around 4 lakh bags, each weighing 50 kg, of seed potato from potato growers from Punjab for Rs. 1,300 a quintal. The price was fixed by the district administration in consultations with farmers representatives and peoples representatives. It was sufficient for sowing in 15,000 hectares (ha). Meanwhile, farmers who have irrigation facilities have completed sowing.Shakeel Ahmed, Deputy Director of Horticulture, said sowing was complete in over 10,000 ha. Owing to lack of rain, a major chunk of crop has gone waste. In several areas, germinated seeds have dried up. Only those who can water their crop can hope of getting back any yield, he said.Mr. Shakeel Ahmed said he was aware of farmers selling seeds. They must have thought of getting back at least half of the money they spent on seed potato, he said. Even farmers with irrigation facilities were finding it difficult as many borewells had dried up.For the last four years, farmers had been incurring losses owing to blight.Cold storage unit owners too are a worried lot as potato growers are some of their main clients.Pratap, owner of a cold storage unit here, said many like him were dependant on the yield of potatoes. If there is no yield, we too will not get any business, he said."
195,"Supply short, prices climb",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120626/jsp/odisha/story_15656555.jsp,2012-06-26,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, June 25: Shortage of supply has pushed up vegetable prices and upset the household budget of the common man. The cost of almost every vegetable, barring potatoes and onions, has shot through the roof with the hike ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 30 per kilogram. Rising prices of essential commodities have burnt a hole in our pocket. It is especially difficult for the middle-income group. I am a vegetarian and it is hard for me to include different varieties of vegetables in my daily menu, said Prafulla Kumar Mohanty, a retired police officer. Vendors attributed the rise in price to the loss of local vegetable crop owing to the heat wave conditions that had gripped the state, particularly the coastal belt. The mercury had nearly touched 47C in Bhubaneswar earlier this month. A considerable amount of vegetables that the farmers produce just before the monsoon went waste this year. The vegetables could not survive the heat that prevailed in the state until mid June, said Unit-I daily market general secretary Gaydhar Swain. The prices of some vegetables in the city have almost doubled as compared to last years rates. This sharp increase is in the range of Rs 20-30 per kg depending on the vegetable. Even potatoes and onions now cost Rs 16 and Rs 14 a kg respectively. At present, Bhubaneswar and its peripheral areas consume nearly 300 tonnes of potatoes and 100 tonnes of onions. However, we dont have records of the exact quantity of other vegetables being sold in the market since many small-time traders are involved in the business, said a trader. I have less choice of vegetables to cook these days. Now, it is just potatoes for lunch and dinner. Imagine having a diabetic at home and having nothing but potatoes to cook, said homemaker Rupa Swain, 44. A senior member of the traders organisation in Unit-I daily market, Santosh Sahu, said the prices would not come down at least for the next two months. The new crops will come only after two months. We have to wait until then and see what happens, he said, adding that the neighbouring states of Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand, which supply vegetables to Odisha, had also been affected by the heat wave. As businessmen, we are also feeling the heat of the rising prices, he said. The rise in fuel prices has also pushed up the transportation cost of the vegetables. Despite keeping a low profit margin, the customer turnout has been disappointing over the past fortnight, said Abhaya Sahoo, a vendor. Earlier, I had my bag full after spending just about Rs 100. Now, I have to spend at least double that amount, said Mitali Pradhan, a schoolteacher."
196,No respite from price pinch,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/No-respite-from-price-pinch/articleshow/14419840.cms,2012-06-27,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: Chances of vegetables prices coming down now looks a distant dream. If you are buying green chillies at anything between Rs 150 to Rs 200 and both parwal (potol) and ladies finger at Rs 40-45 per kg, then there is no silver lining yet.According to figures given by agricultural marketing minister Arup Roy, the prices are higher than what it was last year in the retail market. This includes vegetables like ladies finger, parwal, bitter gourd, potato and so on. Roy, however, said on Tuesday that any intervention could begin only a couple of weeks later, after the assembly session is over.He , though, did not clarify on the reason behind the delay in intervention, when the prices are shooting up almost every day. It is possibly since Roy will have to attend the session, he can take up the issue only after that. ""I will also talk to the farmers,"" he said.Also, the task force that was formed last year after the Trinamool Congress came to the power, is yet to give any report, Roy said.The team, formed with officials from relevant departments, was to go to the markets - both wholesale and retail - and talk to farmers to find out how the prices of vegetables were so high in the retail market, when the farmers were selling them at a paltry sum.""This year, the task force which held a meeting on Monday, would only begin its drive in a few days to check the situation at the ground level,"" Roy said. However, intervention would mean keeping a check, so that hoarding doesn't take place. In any case, for perishable commodities like vegetables, hoarding is not an issue.On Monday, the minister had said that the government would offer subsidy to farmers on transport, so that they could sell their produce to the wholesale markets and the number of middlemen would minimize. However, on Tuesday, the minister made it clear that any such intervention was meant only after mid July, by when he would go and talk to farmers ""and ask them what they want and if such a subsidy will help them""."
197,Pocket pinch in veggie crunch,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120628/jsp/jharkhand/story_15666261.jsp,2012-06-28,Telegraph,"Pricey vegetables are giving the prized chicken an inferiority complex. Supply shortage has prompted vendors across vegetable markets in the state to rate hitherto humble greens as high as Rs 180-200 per kg, much higher than lean meat that sells at Rs 150 a kg. Pumpkin and potato seem the only vegetables affordable at Rs 20-25 a kg. Heavy rain in vegetable baskets of Ranchi such as Pithoria, Kanke, Namkum, Mandar, Ratu, Bero and Chanho is to be blamed for this pocket pinch. While in some cases, crops have been damaged, in others, farmers have plucked their greens for export to urban centres in Odisha and Bengal, besides Jharkhand, leading to short supply. For the past week, vegetable prices have been hitting the roof as most vendors are out of market. Ranchis Lalpur market, which boasted 200-odd vendors from morning till evening on any given day, saw barely 50 on Wednesday. Vegetables have ceased to come from villages. Cant you see the entire market is deserted? vendor Shanti Devi said, adding that it would take more than a month before budget flavour returned to green curry. Every year, we face this situation after the onset of monsoon as heavy rain damages vegetables, resulting in shortage, said Jaglal Paswan, a vegetable vendor near Tatanagar railway station. Among vegetables, the cost crown goes to beans, which has disappeared from the markets. The few vendors, who have managed to hoard a basket or two, have struck gold. They are selling their green fortune at Rs 90-100 per kg in Ranchi and a whopping Rs 180 per kg in Jamshedpur. Coriander and green chilli are giving beans competition too, with prices pegged at Rs 180-200 a kg. Patna parwal  a special variety of the pointed gourd  is carrying a price tag of Rs 80 per kg in Ranchi, while its ubiquitous cousin is yours for Rs 40 per kg. Cauliflower, green capsicum, carrot, ladyfinger and bitter gourd are each being sold at Rs 40 per kg, while tomato, cabbage and brinjal are a tad cheaper at Rs 30-50 per kg. The prices have increased by 50 per cent in 10 days. Meat  chicken or mutton  was always expensive, and now, vegetables are giving it tough competition. We have already cut down on quantity, but if prices dont fall we will have to give up eating vegetables, said Somen Mitra, a resident of Burdwan Compound, as he crammed a large pumpkin in his small bag in Lalpur. Vegetable prices will give you a shock. My kitchen budget has gone haywire, said Dimple Kaur, a homemaker and better half of Ranchi Municipal Corporation standing committee member A.S. Deol. Prices of some vegetables have increased by more than 300 per cent. Can you believe it? We dont know what to eat and what not to eat. Hope the prices come down soon, said Manjeet Kaur, a homemaker in Sakchi. Deo Kumar Dhan, the president of Adivasi Fal-Sabji Utpadak Samiti, Ranchi, said fresh crop would take at least a couple of months to hit the market. That is when prices of greens will hopefully come down, he said. A. Wadood, chairman of agro-physics and meteorology department at Birsa Agriculture University in Kanke, echoed Dhan. Vegetables have completed their life cycles and hence, there is scarcity in the market. Farmers are sowing vegetables again, but it will take at least 30 days for them to mature, he said. Till then, eat less, eat long. What will you eat for lunch if prices continue to soar? Tell ttkhand@abpmail.com"

While crop loss is causing anxiousness among farmers, scarcity of drinking water and fodder for cattle has turned out to be a major crisis, he said.He criticised the district in-charge minister for not making an attempt to either visit the district or take any steps to solve the problem, although the district has been reeling under drought.He lambasted the district administration for its lackadaisical approach in solving the issue by just submitting a proposal seeking Rs 26 crore for drought relief while potato in 25,000 hectares of land and commercial crops on 8,000 hectares have been lost due to delay in monsoon. He alleged the MLAs of nepotism.The district has received only 25 per cent of the expected rainfall according to the meteorological department. The downswing in prices of ginger and turmeric forced many farmers to sow potatoes. While ragi is grown on more than 60,000 hectares of land every year, the area under this crop has reduced to only 20,000 hectares.On what basis has the district administration sought only Rs 26 crore to tackle drought, he questioned.He alleged that not a single government project has been implemented in the district properly. Steps should be taken to issue pahani to farmers on priority, he opined.He also demanded that the district in-charge minister be changed for better functioning of the district administration."
199,On the paradox of ‘potato chips and potato’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/on-the-paradox-of-potato-chips-and-potato/article3587781.ece,2012-06-30,The Hindu,"Technological foresight is inevitable for the nations progress, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Central government R. Chidambaram has said.He was speaking after unveiling a bust of C.V. Raman at the Department of Optoelectronics on the Karyavattom campus of the University of Kerala on Friday.The nations development and national security are but two sides of the same coin. Development without security is weak and security without development, meaningless. Indias technological needs range from food processing rural areas to nuclear power. The development of food processing technology in the rural areas deserves urgent attention, Dr. Chidambaram said.It is the absence of food technology in the rural areas that led to the paradoxical phenomenon of the rise to Rs.20 for a packet of potato chips when the price of potato fell to Rs.2 a kg. Though there is fundamental knowledge in the rural areas, the technology needed to harness that knowledge has not yet been put in place, he said.Research in the country should focus on finding answers to basic problems. Today, the technology which can predict tsunamis is more or less a reality. Each researcher should ask oneself whether an issue, a research question, is of importance to either science or society.Though universities in the country are good in research, they return only an average score on the development front. They are downright backward when it comes to extension activities.On the other hand, industrial establishments are experts in extension programmes but are deficient on the research front. Whenever a new technology is introduced in the country, pat comes the question, is this technology proven? What such people do not realise is that if a technologys application has been fully proven, it is already outdated, he pointed out.Dr. Chidambaram said, however, for fundamental questions to be given importance and for them to the answered, importance needed to be given to fundamental research.It has become a habit with experts to neglect fundamental research questions. It was when he was baffled by a basic question about wavelength that physicist Verner Heisenberg went on to delineate the uncertainty principle, Dr. Chidambaram pointed out.There need scarcely be another example to show that basic questions would lead to wonderful discoveries, he added.Vice-Chancellor A. Jayakrishnan presided over the meeting."
200,Price worry takes CM to market,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Price-worry-takes-CM-to-market/articleshow/14538580.cms,2012-07-01,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: The government which apparently seemed oblivious till now, suddenly woke up to the crisis of inflation on Saturday after the chief minister went on a market survey. Finally, it took chief minister Mamata Banerjee's physical inquiry of the markets to make the government wake up to the crisis of inflation.The chief minister Mamata Banerjee visited Koley and Lansdowne markets to realise that vegetables prices are going through the roof with even green chillies commanding a retail price of Rs 12 a kg. At the end of the visit, she gave a piece of her mind at a public gathering, saying, ""I can't run about inspecting markets. The department concerned should be doing its job.""The oblique reference to agriculture and marketing minister Aroop Roy showed that the chief minister was back on centre stage to control rise in prices of vegetables and other essential commodities. She has called an emergency meeting at Writers' Buildings on Monday and issued a public warning to hoarders against the created crisis. ""My government won't allow these black marketers to do whatever they like. I shall take stern steps against them if they don't heed to our warning,"" the chief minister said in the afternoon at a rally in the heart of the city.Getting firsthand versions of matters has been Mamata's signature approach to assessing vexatious issues. Last year, after having inspected the markets, the CM after her inspection of markets, she had set up a task force for controlling price rise. The steps helped contain prices to some extent but the monitoring mechanism fell inert with time.Last August, on her 100th day in office, Mamata had visited two major markets in the city to check out vegetable prices which had trebled with the onset of a flood-like situation in some parts of the state. Doing a ditto on Saturday, she revisited the Koley wholesale market and also dropped by at Lansdowne retail market on her way to the state secretariat. To reporters at Writers' Buildings, she said, ""I have called a meeting on July 2 to discuss price rise,"" Mamata told reporters at Writers' Buildings.At a time when most households have restructured their staple menu to cushion themselves from the exorbitant rise in perishable food items, the Mamata Banerjee government seemed to be a sitting duck for the last few weeks. Roy only convened a meeting last week and seemed quite clueless about checking price rise.Finally, on Saturday, the step came from the chief minister. She expressed her concern at a rally at Metro Channel to commemorate the Santhal rebellion. Issuing her warning in public, Mamata said, ""A section of hoarders are creating this artificial crisis of essential commodities. After getting complaints against price rise from common people, I decided to pay surprise visits to these markets.""She said she had spoken to the dealers to get firsthand knowledge of the crisis. ""I was surprised to find that potato sells at Rs 16 a kg at Koley while farmers are selling it for Rs 8 a kg. Why this gap? I am told that a section of traders are hoarding big time. Potato and seasonal vegetables are being stored for three to four days, thus creating an artificial crisis."" ""Similarly, the price of rice has gone up from Rs 3 to Rs 5 a kg. It is the poor who are at the receiving end of this inflation,"" added the CM."
201,Soya delicacies make inroads into capital,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Soya-delicacies-make-inroads-into-capital/articleshow/14540306.cms,2012-07-01,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Not long ago, chicken and mutton were the natural suffixes to Afghani, Achari, Rara, Haryali in any restaurant menu. But now you can add soya to the list, with reputed non-vegetarian eateries offering kebabs, tikkas, champs, even soya on a stick.Popular in dhabas and other small restaurants for some years, these soya dishes mimic the fleshiness of meat and have made inroads into the more upscale joints. Connaught Place's Nizam's Kathi Kebabs, known for its mutton, chicken, egg and potato rolls, has given in to the soya seduction. They introduced a soya tikka roll last year. Even Khan Market newbie Arza Bibi Kebabs has decided to include soya tikka roomali rolls in its menu. GK 1's Cafe Brown Sugar offers soya momos, chops and achari wraps. Pindi Soya Wah Bhai Wah has four outlets in NCR with more coming up shortly. In fact, a vegetarian restaurant chain has even named itself Soya Express.Customers seem to be enjoying the new stuff in the old marinade. Sumeet Dhall, director of Soya Express says at a conservative estimate, soya dishes make up for 45% of his total sales. Karamjeet Singh of restaurant chain Wah Ji Wah says about 70% of his sales are from soya-based items.'Replication' is the flavour of the month. Dhall says soya dishes can replicate the taste and texture of chicken and sometimes even non-veg clients cannot tell the difference. Soya-based dishes work well for converts to vegetarianism. Or, as the Wah Ji Wah website puts it, ""Being veg, craving for non-veg, no more test, Wah Ji Wah is the best"".Noida-based software engineer Shilpa Gandotra, who turned vegetarian 12 years ago, laps up the soya chaap she gets down the street. ""It's quite tasty and always a change."" Delhi-based professional Mansi Gupta, 25, says it's like ""chicken for vegetarians"".Sumeet Chugh of Nizam's introduced it on the restaurant's menu owing to a personal need. He avoids eating non-vegetarian food on Tuesdays and is a gym freak. ""I needed something with the same amount of protein as non-veg food. That's when I sat down with my chef and came up with this,"" says Chugh.The bean's growing popularity is being reflected on the ground. According to consultancy firm Technopak Advisors, the overall organized soya market is worth Rs 450-500 crore and it is growing annually at 18-20%.Food critic Maryam Reshi says, ""It is a versatile ingredient. You can serve it dry or in a gravy. "" But she objects to the mince being shaped and coloured-like prawns in some oriental restaurants. ""If you are a vegetarian, wouldn't that gross you out?"" she says.Even outlets selling soya-based dishes for many years have expanded their menu to cash in on the demand. About 15 years ago, Rakesh Singla of Model Town's Eating Corner started with malai chaap. He has now diversified with an achari chaap, mughlai chaap and even a pudina chaap.However, ""good raw soya is difficult to find in the market, though soyabean is widely produced in our country. If we import raw processed soya, the prices would be at par with our chicken rolls, which may not go down well with vegetarians,"" says Chugh. Desi or otherwise, the verdict has already ""bean"" given."
202,A solution to Singur impasse?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/A-solution-to-Singur-impasse/articleshow/14571981.cms,2012-07-02,The Times Of India,"The hasty government decision to turn the agriculturally prosperous area of Singur in Hooghly district into an industrial zone in 2006 was based on two justifications - one is the unhealthy but unavoidable 'race to the bottom' pursued by states to woo big business after liberalization, and the second is the golden chance to attract big business to Bengal, which witnessed a systematic escape of industrial capital to other states for three decades.While both made sense, there's no defence for the method pursued to achieve the goal. The minimum necessity for success in this route is to conduct a detailed socioeconomic survey among the residents of the potential project-affected area by experienced social scientists (a condition which the Centre has been mulling to incorporate in the new bill on land acquisition) but that was not done. On the other hand, the then government in Bengal suffered from indecision for almost 20 years regarding its stand toward private capital, initially domestic later foreign. One cannot expect to win a 100-metre hurdle race after inaction for such a long period - it needed a gradual change, through creation of infrastructure and land bank and a time-consistent balance among small, medium and large industries. Whichever way we see it, the Singur imbroglio had its root in this.A recent survey in the potential project-affected area in Singur by Maitreesh Ghatak of LSE and his associates reveals that the government erred on several counts. In the surveyed area, the government assumed that 96% land to be acquired (around 997 acres) was sali (one-crop land) whereas in their survey only 63% turned out to be so. In reality, it may be still higher since improvement in productivity through irrigation has been widespread in the area in the last two decades.Thus the survey found that the average compensation was around Rs 8.75 lakh, which clearly was much less that what the land owners should have got. Also, the survey revealed poor management of the compensation money. Since, almost 89% people simply put it in fixed deposits in bank, which today gives a real return of 2-3% given the high rate of inflation. So the residents lost a productive asset but could not acquire a compensating asset for lack of good planning.And then, the 2011 population census revealed that of the 4,971 households in the affected moujas, around 1,000 directly owned or rented land. The government claim that 9,839 people accepted cheques till December 31, 2006, points to fragmented ownership, absenteeism of landowners as well as complete disregard of the welfare of the majority of the residents who were agricultural and non-agricultural labourers. So the project had an obvious disconnect with the ground reality.Do we have a way out of the Singur stalemate? After all, the agricultural land there has been transformed into a non-productive asset by the turn of events. Assuming an average productivity of paddy of 1,346 kg per acre (as revealed in the survey mentioned above) and double cropping in 50% of acquired land, the loss due to paddy alone would be around Rs 50 crore in market price over the last six years. If we add potato and vegetables, the loss would be still higher. Along with this, one needs to add the monetary equivalence of insecurity and unhappiness of the residents in the area, which is certainly a huge amount as well. This is a loss for Bengal as a whole and we need a solution at the earliest.There can be a two-pronged approach to solve the impasse -the first gives priority to the socio-economic aspect and the other to the legal process.The first requires a negotiated settlement among the government, the Tatas and its associates as well as the local residents. When the Tata group moved to Sanand in Gujarat - an area having almost 1/4th land productivity as Singur by some estimates - they negotiated with GIDC and paid a purchase price of Rs 36.42 lakh per acre (reported in newspapers).In contrast, a calculation by retired IIMC professor Nirmal Chandra in the 'Economic and Political Weekly' showed that the Tatas effectively pays Rs 5.42 lakh per acre for 99-year lease in Singur.One can negotiate with the Tata group for a commensurate compensation to Singur residents for outright purchase of land the government has acquired for them. However, they need to abide by the new clauses introduced in West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955, and set up suitable industrial units within three years of purchase. In the absence of rehabilitation clause in the existing Act, the government, Tatas and the residents need to evolve a consensus rehabilitation scheme so that land-losers can acquire a compensating asset in the form of physical or human capital or land. In addition, tax benefits need to be carefully capped given the revenue need of the present government.This case should be taken as an isolated instance since a multi-crop agricultural land was transformed into a non-productive asset due to past government mis-calculations. In a sense, the thought of persuading the Tatas and their associates to give up the lease is an alternative, but one that is less attractive.This is because Tatas and their associates may demand an unreasonable compensation and it may prove quite costly to return the land to the erstwhile owners (if legally possible since one may have to auction it as per current law) since those who have taken cheques may only give back fraction of their compensation money and some others may not be traceable. Alternatively, land may be returned to those who have not taken cheques, but in either case it will take substantial additional expenditure and time to make the land productive again if possible at all.In the legal option, two alternatives are being discussed - wait for a Supreme Court verdict or accept the latest high court verdict and bring an amended bill for the President's assent. However, both are time consuming, costly and uncertain.A third alternative is to put pressure on the central government to pass the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation (LARR) Act replacing the time-inconsistent 1894 Land Acquisition Act, with additional clauses - namely, allowing some freedom to the states to frame their own acquisition policies and giving special power to return the land to the original owners if it is not used by the private parties for whom the land was acquired in the first place. If such a central Act is passed the state may hasten to bring its own land acquisition and rehabilitation bill and use its power in getting back the Singur land.The state government will certainly be on moral high ground to ask the Centre to pass LARR Act quickly as the country along with its highest court has sympathised time and again with the fate of peasants (of which Singur is a burning example) in this age of mad rush for industrialisation.(The author is professor and coordinator, centre for advanced studies, department of economics, Jadavpur University)"

She also said that forward trading may lead to hoarding of essential commodities and hike in commodity prices.The CM also formed an 11-member task force to monitor the markets and identify hoarders to initiate penal action against them.She said that forward trading is a policy that the Central government is promoting but the state is opposed to it. We will not follow these rules. It is a speculative policy. This is not right. We wont encourage middlemen.Forward marketing is done under the Forward Contract Regulation Act of 1952 and is controlled by the Forward Market Commission. Although the Centre initiated to make an amendment to the Act in 2006,it finally issued a Forward Contracts (Regulation) Ordinance in 2008 on whose strength 24 commodity exchanges operate throughout the country.The Chief Minister said that though the state produces enough potatoes,they are sold at prices between Rs 15 and 27 per kg in various markets. A section of middlemen,functioning between cold storages and the retail markets,were manipulating the prices,she added.Mamata held the the CPM government for the exorbitant prices of vegetables and even ruled out the possibility of all-party meeting with the CPM on the issue.Citing examples,she said that price of potatoes through 2009 was Rs 24-Rs 26 per kilo,and in 2011 the brinjal cost Rs 80 per kilo. The prices dipped after they formed the committee,Mamata claimed.decision on president threedays before poll dateThe Trinamool Congress will take a decision on backing a presidential candidate just three days before the July 19 election.

They carried empty paper plates with slogans written on them, placards and vegetables and held a demonstration on the floor of the House.Left Front members tried to press an adjournment motion on the subject of price rise. When the speaker disallowed a discussion, members of the opposition raised slogans and walked out. The placards and other slogans were directed against the chief minister. Left leaders said Mamata Banerjee's visits to markets to control prices were ineffective and were aimed at playing to the gallery.Addressing the media, opposition leader Surjya Kanta Mishra said price rise was a serious issue which should have been discussed in the assembly. ""We have not moved adjournment motions at the drop of a hat. It was done only on serious issues. No minister has so far made any statement in the assembly on the issue of prices of essentials. Actually, the government is trying to avoid this topic."" Mishra said prices of many commodities were increasing for which the state government could be held solely responsible. There were other commodities in which the Centre had a role, but the ruling party, being a partner in the ruling coalition in Delhi, could not deny its responsibilities for these either. tnnHe said the state government had not implemented the Essential Commodities Act to control prices.""Cold storages are full of potatoes, but potato prices were increasing in the market. The farmers are not getting the benefit of high price either, the middlemen are reaping the benefit. Has the government held any meeting with cold storage owners,"" Misra asked.Chilly is burning a hole in the pocket, but is still not hot enough, opposition leader in West Bengal assembly Surya Kanta Misra lamented on Monday in a news conference. ""Green chilly is selling for Rs 120 to Rs 150 in the open market. But even chilly selling at such high prices is lacking the kick.

She, however, shot down the opposition's demand for an all-party meeting on the issue.The task force, headed by agriculture secretary Subrata Biswas, includes five other government representatives and five members from the trading community. Officials from Kolkata Police, the enforcement directorate and the agriculture and marketing and horticulture departments will meet community representatives every morning to discuss price trends and take action accordingly.The chief minister also hinted at promulgating a law to rein in runaway vegetable prices because the existing laws - the Essential Commodities Act and the Anti-Profiteering Act - do not cover vegetables.The government also decided to import 200 tonnes of green chillies from Katihar. These will be sold in the KMC's 28 regulatory markets and those in the districts.The CM on Saturday visited the wholesale Koley market at Sealdah and the retail market at Lansdowne to check out vegetable prices that had lately gone through the roof. She then called Monday's meeting with agriculture minister Rabindranath Bhattacharya and agriculture and marketing minister Aroop Roy, chief secretary Samar Ghosh, DGP Naparajit Mukherjee, ADG (law and order ) Surajit Kar Purakayasthya and secretaries of agriculture, agriculture and marketing and horticulture departments . Also present were traders from Burrabazar and Posta.

""What meeting?"" the CM snapped. ""What have they (the Left Front government) done in the last 35 years? There are no blocklevel officers in the agri-marketing department . They have demolished the structure.""The Left MLAs staged a walkout in the assembly after speaker Biman Banerjee turned out the plea of an adjournment motion over the issue.The chief minister had obviously not taken kindly to the proceedings: ""In 2009, the cost of brinjal was Rs 80 a kg and people were shelling out Rs 24/Rs 26 for a kg of potato. Now they (the CPM) are shedding crocodile's tears when potato is selling at Rs 16."""

But the farmers of the district have lost a month due to delay in rainy season and fear of less yield this year.The agriculture department had planned to sow seeds in 2.65 hectares but till June sowing was done only in 65,680 hectare only. That means only 26 per cent has been sown.But surprisingly this year, majority of the farmers have sown maize. Joint director of agriculture B Shivaraju said the farmers had ploughed the land and kept it ready and as soon as the rain started they are lining up to purchase seeds. All is well, if there is sufficient rain, but the yield would come down, if the rains is insufficient, opined farmers.LossBut there is also some bad news as the rains that is lashing the district since the past three days may help the farmers who are yet to begin sowing, but the farmers who had already sown til, greengram and others have incurred losses.The farmers had sown them after the rains in April and May in 46,065 hectares and according to survey 50 per cent of the crops have been destroyed. In all, the farmers have incurred 20.64 crore loss, according to sources.Ragi has been sown at 130 hectare, maize in 21,705 hectare and paddy in 1315 hectare. Sakleshpur experienced good rainfall and more farmers have shown interest in purchasing paddy, ragi and maize.StatisticsThe farmers were hoping to raise potato crop as the ginger and turmeric prices crashed but only 60 to 80 per cent has been when compared to last year. Even that has been damaged, as per the statistics available.Last year potato was sown in 20,000 hectare, it is only 16,000 hectare this year. In all, 4.7 lakh bags of seed potatoes have been sold.Blight diseaseWhile Blight disease gave sleepless nights to farmers for the past five years, the purchase of seed potatoes itself turned out to be a big problem this year.However, in spite of all this, with the skies opening up, the farmers hope to get a good yield this year."

""In 2010 and 2011, around 1 crore tonnes of potatoes were produced in the state. But this year, the production is at 85 lakh tonnes. Usually, around 17-18% of the potatoes are released in the market in June. This year, around 22% potatoes are already in the market but the price continues to remain firm,"" an official of Cold Storage Owners' Association said.Big traders also pointed out that price of potato in Uttar Pradesh, the highest producer of the crop in the country, was also high. West Bengal is the second largest producer of potato with wholesale markets in Tarakeshwar, Champadanga, Singur, Ratanpur and Arambagh accounting for not only the bulk of potato sales in the state but also accounting for the demand in Orissa and Assam.Blaming the unusually firm price of potatoes and all other vegetables on middlemen, cold storage owners alleged that the latter were charging a hefty amount on transport cost. Farmers, though, said the earnings remained low with marginal farmers selling their produce at Rs 600-700 a quintal.The CM, on Monday, squarely blamed hoarding for the unprecedented rise in agricultural commodities and called for raids to get supplies going. But traders and cold storage owners countered that politicians of all major parties, including Trinamool Congress and CPM, were part of the trade.""At the potato traders' committee, one can spot Swapan Samanta of Trinamool Congress and former CPM zilla parishad sabhapati Asit Patra. Everyone has a share of the pie. So, why blame a section of traders or cold storage owners?"" asked an owner of a cold storage unit in Hooghly."
209,West Bengal creates task force to control rising vegetable prices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/West-Bengal-creates-task-force-to-control-rising-vegetable-prices/articleshow/14666993.cms,2012-07-04,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA : A new task force has been created by the state government to put a brake on the spiralling cost of fresh vegetables in the local markets. Prices have gone up by nearly five times over the past 10 days creating widespread panic and an outcry against the state government for not taking action to control prices.The task force would conduct surprise checks on marlets to see if vegetables are being sold at a uniform price across the city. This decision was taken after chief minister Mamata Banerjee visited markets on Tuesday and found out for herself that the increase is manmade and middlemen and traders who worked between the farmer in the fields and the buyer in retail markets were playing truant.The enforcement brancch of city police has been activated to help the specially created task force in conducting the surprise checks. News of such stringent state action has already brought down vegetable prices by anything between rupees eight to rupees ten a kilo. However, people are still complaining about the price of potatoes and green chillies.Green chillies were selling at Rs 150 to Rs 180 a kilo till Tuesday afternnon but the state action has brought it down to Rs 100 in one blow. However, farmers say that they are selling these to traders at Rs 20-30 a kilo! """"There was a task force in place, however it is clear that it was not conducting its duties well as a result of which the chief minister had to take to the streets herself. The newly created task force has been given the target to bring about an order in the rising prices,"""" said state food and agricultural supplies minister, Arup Ray."
210,"Old job, new times ",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120704/jsp/opinion/story_15685419.jsp,2012-07-04,Telegraph,"Finance minister again Just over a fortnight has passed since a successful strategic dialogue ended misgivings of perception about relations between India and the United States of America, but already stage-managed expectations are threatening to revisit bilateral ties. The takeover of the Union finance ministry by the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has been followed in its wake by a deliberate and orchestrated effort to create the simplistic impression that, with Singh, the economist and architect of Indias original economic liberalization, in direct charge of North Block, everything is going to be fine. The result of this ill-advised attempt is predictable: disenchantment in Washington about New Delhi all over again in many quarters and a familiar resistance and resentment in India against what may appear to Indians as typical American high-handedness. In the last few days, prominent Indians  some in authority  visiting Washington have told some Americans in closed-door meetings to expect foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail as early as next week. Others have promised the moon, such as an immediate withdrawal of a retroactive tax announced in Pranab Mukherjees latest budget when he was finance minister. Concurrently, leaders of representative organizations on Indian industry and commerce are travelling the world rousing expectations that the United Progressive Alliance government is about to unleash a new wave of sweeping reforms that will accelerate growth and open up the country to foreigners. Such a campaign does a disservice to the prime minister: with friends like these he doesnt need enemies. But more pertinently, it distorts the ground realities in the UPA, especially within its dominant partner, the Congress, which continues to be socialist at its core and suspicious of a bigger role for Westerners in any sphere. Add to that Sonia Gandhis penchant for the status quo and her absolute necessity to put up a winning show in at least some of the state elections in the offing and what is likely is more of a window-dressing in economic management rather than any sweeping changes. Left to himself, Singh would like to continue as finance minister in the slot vacated by Mukherjee, but it is only realistic to anticipate that it will not be left to him. Had that been the case, he would have held on to his coveted portfolio in 2004: it was fairly well known in Delhi when he was chosen as prime minister eight years ago that he also wished to present another budget to Parliament reliving his biggest legacy yet that goes back to the 1990s. He was not allowed to do so then. Additionally, there is nothing to suggest that what could have been a public relations fiasco following his re-election as head of government in 2009 will not repeat itself while choosing Mukherjees successor. The messy spectacle of Singhs man of choice for North Block, the economist, C. Rangarajan, quitting the Rajya Sabha a mere three months after the Congress turned down the prime ministers choice as finance minister did not cause a media frenzy then because it was overshadowed by the unexpected UPA victory in the elections. At that time, UPA II was still in its honeymoon period and basking in the reflected glory of UPA I. The truth is that, as a rule, of all the appointments that a prime minister makes, the most difficult one is the choice of a finance minister. Even in 1996, although it was clear from the start that Atal Bihari Vajpayees 13-day government would not survive, the longest and the most tortuous negotiations were over the choice of Jaswant Singh for North Block. Sonia Gandhi could not have forgotten that her late husband made a cardinal error of political judgment when he made V.P. Singh his finance minister in 1984. With Lok Sabha polls only two years away, she cannot now overlook how the finance ministry-centric income tax raids on the daughter and son-in-law of the Congress leader, Chiranjeevi, in mid-May played a part in the partys humiliating loss of the Tirupati assembly seat which the former actor had held before he was catapulted to the Rajya Sabha. The ghost of that defeat will haunt the party well into the next elections to the state legislature and the Lok Sabha in Andhra Pradesh, a state that is critical for the Congress. In the 1990s, when P.V. Narasimha Raos dispensation was vigorously implementing economic reforms under the direction of the present prime minister, Rajesh Pilot and Salman Khursheed together appeared at one campaign stop in a state election, both stumping for the same Congress candidate. Pilot was then minister of state in the home ministry in charge of internal security and Khursheed had the same rank in the external affairs ministry. At this campaign stop, Khursheed spoke in praise of economic reforms, his address replete with the discredited India-shining phraseology. Pilot, on the other hand, spoke of the need to rein in the Tatas, the Birlas and their ilk, recalling how the Congress had wrested control of the commanding heights of the economy from corporate families with the welfare of the people in mind. What is more, Pilot, a much more astute politician than Khursheed with a finger on the pulse of the electorate, remonstrated with the latter for adopting a campaign line that was sure to cost their candidate the election. Not much has changed within the Congress since then to warrant the belief that now that Singh is in charge of North Block, he will have a free hand to make changes to economic policy of the kind that champions of liberalization are demanding of UPA II. Why then are men from New Delhi now descending on Washington, men who are by no means lacking in intelligence or insight, telling the Americans that the worst is over and that a hundred flowers are going to blossom on the Indian economic scene, to borrow Mao Zedongs famous 1957 phrase about Chinas short-lived overall liberalization? In part, it is because, sadly, many Indians want to tell Americans what they wish to hear. This is not necessarily because these people hope to benefit by doing so although in some instances that may well be true. Some interlocutors do this because it stops the Americans from carping and relieves US pressure, at least temporarily, on India to act. They calculate that such false promises get the Americans off their backs in the sanguine knowledge that once they are out of Washington and back in Delhi what they said or predicted does not matter anymore. For that reason, the visit of the Bengal finance minister, Amit Mitra, to Washington next week will be closely watched for signals that would give an idea of the course Indias politics and economics will take in the coming months. Mitra, Americans believe, will offer an unvarnished picture of what can truly be expected from India at his meetings, most of which are either closed door or off-the-record. It defeats common sense why more Indians interacting with Americans do not berate them for their actions, especially regarding Iran, which raise the global price of oil. Instead, more often than not, many Indians are being apologetic about their governments tardiness in reforming itself. New Delhi has a very good case to carp in return in Washington about how high oil prices are wreaking havoc on Indias economy to the point where petrol subsidies became a political hot potato recently. At a time when the rupee is depreciating, it is especially necessary to exercise great caution in raising Americas expectations about India since a high dollar vis-a-vis the Indian currency can only result in a drive to cut imports out of necessity. That goes against US interests at a time when only exports and more job creation can save Barack Obama in the November election and the US economy in the long run. In any case, the next chapter in India's growth story can only be partially written at home. The country is more exposed to the inter-nation financial system now than ever before. That means Singh is no longer in a position to do many of the things he did when he was finance minister under Rao. His success now, unlike in 1991-96, will depend on what Angela Merkel of Germany or David Cameron of Britain do, which can have an impact on India as well."
211,HOT POTATO,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120705/jsp/opinion/story_15689945.jsp,2012-07-05,Telegraph,"Even Bengalis need reassurances. For that, theatre is the thing and a great director provides spectacle whatever the provocation: a cricket victory or the price of chilli. It does not take great imagination to see why Mamata Banerjee succeeds as the great director. The people of West Bengal must have been reassured to see their chief minister paying her characteristic whirlwind visit to the markets in response to the spiralling prices of chilli  and of almost all other everyday vegetables together with the ubiquitous potato. The speed with which Ms Banerjee formed a task force to monitor and rein in prices must have assured one and all that the runaway prices of chilli would be seized by the scruff of the neck in no time at all. If wishes were horses, a great director would have easily ridden high prices down. But prices have a habit of rising for complicated reasons. The supply-demand wobble caused by the global shortage in agricultural produce is exacerbated in India, particularly in West Bengal, by structural problems, such as the fragmentation of land and lack of transparency in distribution. The householder might be paying huge amounts for his handful of chilli, but little of that is going to the producer. Yet the politician is busy trying to bring the price down; it is important that the buyer goes home happy. If politics could work this magic, potato prices should not have climbed all over again; the former government had forced its price down for a phase. But ignoring the logic of demand and supply does not pay. Administered prices in the former Soviet Union led to empty shelves and endless queues of waiting customers. If prices could be fixed by governments with only political and ideological goals in mind, the Soviet empire would not have crashed. Policing prices can hardly be the solution the chief minister is looking for. There have to be ways of increasing agricultural production, of course, together with a review of ways of land use. And while it is important to crack down on possible hoarders and on traders and middlemen who are jacking up prices artificiallly  the police will be helping Ms Banerjees price-monitoring task force by doing that  these must also be seen as systemic problems that would be smoothed out with systemic changes. While being reassured, maybe the people of West Bengal should look forward to that."

They feel too little has been done and too late to address the situation.Septuagenarian Ranjit Sinha went out to the Gariahat market early on Wednesday, believing prices would reduce appreciably following chief minister Mamata Banerjee's strong words on Monday. He was in for a shock. Only chillies were cheaper. Though brinjal, bitter gourd, capsicum and French bean were cheaper by 20-50%, the price of potato, tomato, carrot, papaya, striped gourd and ridged gourd remained firm.""It was a relief to see the chief minister take note of the escalating price of vegetables. But I wonder why it took the government so long to step in when the matter affects the common man. Once price of vegetables are allowed to rise to a certain level, they hold firm unless there is a glut in the market. Rarely do prices reduce to the original level after a series of steady hikes,"" he remarked.While the skyrocketing price of vegetables is hurting everyone, those who shop at Gariahat are still buying what they need because they can afford to do so. It is those hailing from middle and lower middle-class households like Minati Das of Peyarabagan bustee who are feeling the pinch the most.""For over a month, we have been living on rice, pulses and mashed potato with an occasional fish for variety. To buy vegetables at the current prices, we have to forgo something else and right now, there aren't many corners to cut,"" she said.At Manicktala market, too, there was only a slight difference in the price of most vegetables between Monday and Wednesday. ""Where has the price got down? I do not see much difference,"" remarked homemaker Sandhya Sarkar, who went out to shop for the entire week but could buy enough for only two days.Veggie retailers too have become smart. Realizing that the buyers are shocked and put off when any vegetable costs more than Rs 100 a kilio, they are now quoting the price in smaller quantities. ""I tell customers that chillies are Rs 12 for 100 gm, capsicum Rs 15 for 100 gram and so on. Earlier, we would quote the price of half a dozen green bananas but now we tell the price of a pair,"" said Haridas Ghosh, a vegetable seller at Gariahat market.At Baisakhi market in Salt Lake, too, the scenario was no different with prices marginally lower than the previous days but not enough to bring smiles to customers. ""There is need for more stringent monitoring and control. Why is it that there is a huge outcry when petrol gets costlier, although it affects only car owners, but there is no reaction to an abnormal rise in vegetable prices, which affects every kitchen,"" wondered homemaker Swagata Das.Baisakhi resident Ranjan Dutta blamed the administration for failing to regulate prices. ""Vegetables do get costlier when there is too much rain and fields get flooded. But prices have never soared like this in the past. If the government thinks middlemen are responsible, why doesn't it act?"" asked Dutta.With the Trinamool Congress holding complete sway in the districts where vegetables are grown, not many are willing to buy the argument that the Opposition is engineering the crisis. Even retailers dismiss the notion and say that the only way prices would remain reasonable would be to ensure adequate supply of vegetables and streamlining of the farm-to-table distribution chain. ""Farmers don't have time to leave the farm and come to the city to sell vegetables to us. Someone has to do the job of procuring vegetables and transporting them to various wholesale markets,"" retailer Sushil Mondal pointed out."
213,State veggie sale plan in rot,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120706/jsp/calcutta/story_15695664.jsp,2012-07-06,Telegraph,"The plan to set up fair-price shops for vegetables to keep rates in check has been put into cold storage after several officials of the agriculture marketing department cited how a similar plan for potatoes had turned out to be a rotten one a few years ago. The officials explained to the 11-member task force for price control how they had a tough time trying to sell potatoes back in 2010. The plan of selling potatoes or other vegetables through state-run outlets is a faulty one. In 2010, some of the stock was found to have rotted and consumers started abusing us, a senior official said in the second meeting of the task force. Some officials had been suspended for no fault of theirs. We dont want a repeat of that. Rajesh Sinha, the additional secretary of the agriculture marketing department, reportedly tried persuading the officials but in vain. The task force finally decided to put on hold the decision to sell vegetables from fair-price shops and instead focus on distribution of vegetables, specially potatoes, from the cold storage to retail markets. Sinha, however, refused to elaborate. I wouldnt like to say anything. Please ask the secretary, Subrata Biswas. I can only say that the price of vegetables has dropped in the retail markets. Biswas was not available for comment. With the focus shifting to distribution, some task force members fanned out to retail markets at Taltala and Janbazar while others went to Tarakeswar to take stock of the potatoes lying in cold storage. There were discussions on whether we can introduce bills quoting the price of potatoes in the cold storage, at the wholesale market on a given day and the retail markets, said a member of the task force. From the cold storage to the truck, potatoes get hotter by about Rs 3."

The only thing chief minister Mamata Banerjee told me was to procure chilies from Haldibari,"" Roy said. The mayor, however, said the agriculture marketing department was supposed to sell vegetables at a fair price at eight KMC markets located across the cityfrom Thursday. Chatterjee said the space would be reserved for the department, and it could use the space whenever it wants. The civic body will provide the state agriculture department with 10 mobile vans to be stationed at these municipal markets for selling vegetables at fair price, he added.It was decided at Thursday's meeting that the state agriculture marketing department officials will visit places in Hooghly district for procurement of potato at a fair price which will be sold in the city's market at a subsidized rate. The team of officials will take up the issue with the district magistrate, a member of the task force said.Apart from selling vegetables from the eight municipal markets, the state government also wants the KMC to reserve space in the prominent KMC markets for sale of rice. State food minister Jyotipriya Mullick on Thursday said his department had planned to sell rice at a fair price from municipal markets. ""I need space in the KMC markets to enable us sell rice at a fair price,"" Mullick told reporters. However, mayor said the food minister had not communicated his decision to him. However, giving space in the municipal markets will be no major issue, the mayor said."
215,Dada-tax squeeze on market,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Dada-tax-squeeze-on-market/articleshow/14740781.cms,2012-07-08,The Times Of India,"SEORAPHULI (HOOGHLY): It's 3.30am in Tarakeswar market . Filament bulbs cast dull patches of glow here and there. Middleman Shankar Das starts his 'vano '  a Tata Magic that locals have named so to rhyme with Nano  loaded with vegetables. Through the darkness a hand suddenly stretches out before him. Shankar pushes a Rs 100 note mechanically into the palm. But it refuses to go. The man in the shadows knows the profit the vanload will make in Kolkata. Shankar grumbles and presses Rs 20 more . The hand disappears into the chaos of the market.There are outstretched hands in every vehicle in the market. The same scene is repeated in Seoraphuly bazaar, the next stop for vegetable-laden vans on the way to Kolkata. And this is why the jhinge and begun you buy in your para market still singes your pocket despite the government's crackdown.TOI followed a consignment of vegetables from a farmer in Madpur to Kolkata and witnessed firsthand how the ""dada tax ""  extortion  jacks up prices to unprecedented levels in the city.The extortion has not stopped. It has simply moved from the highways to the markets. With the government under pressure , policemen no longer stop lorries and stretch out their palms. Goons, patronized by local netas, do the deduction at source.TOI saw a band of ruffians lurking about Seoraphuly haat , one of the biggest wholesale vegetable markets of the state, as early as 4.45am. They are neither buyers, nor sellers. They are the tolabaaj (local extortionists ), backed solidly by the trinity of police, politicians and phoreys (middlemen ). The guro (booty ) is shared equally.There is such enthusiasm for the guro that the rowdies man-mark almost every wholesale trader and every truck or van that enters or leaves the market . Buyers and sellers from five districts  North and South 24-P arganas, Burdwan , Hooghly and Nadia  flock to this 300-year-old bazaar on thousands of vanos and trucks daily. There are rich pickings here. Even a layman's estimate is that the annual dada-tax collection runs into crores. The tola (dada-tax ) is fixed depending on the commodity. There is some degree of flexibility in adjusting the tola to evade any laafra (trouble ). Even Seoraphuly Rajbari earns a share and the Seoraphuly Regulated Market Committee receives Rs 2, 3 or 5 from each trader according to the space allotted to them, say sources.""This is nothing new. Tolabaaji is an age-old practice in Seoraphuli market. They thrive when prices shoot up, and lie low when the market is down,"" said Congress leader and former MLA from neighbouring Chapdani Abdul Mannan. However , Baidyabati Municipality chairman Ajay Prasad Singh refuses to admit that extortion is leading to the high price of vegetables. ""The Kali Puja committee collects some chanda daily for Kali Puja so that traders don't have to pay a big amount at one go,"" he explains.The dada tax is all pervasive. At Tarakeswar wholesale market, which used to be an out-andout farmers' bazaar, rogues have the last word now. ""Aamra to loot hotei asi (We come here to get fleeced),"" sighed Sk Ekramul Ali, who was forced to sell ribbed gourd (jhinge ) at Rs 15 per palla (5 kg ). Thirty-five kilometers on , in Seoraphuly , his jhinge sold for Rs 40 per palla . And by 10am, in Kolkata , it was selling for Rs 30 a kilo  10 times higher than the price the farmer got for it.At Seoraphuly, Shankar was grumbling the same way as Ali, from whom he had bought the jhinge an hour ago. After selling his goods to a bigger phorey, Amiya Patra , and handing over his daily 'tola' , he put his van in gear and said : ""These people are thugs, but they do find me customers very quickly. Time is money, sir."" Amiya, meanwhile, coughed up another levy after loading his merchandise on a Matador . Another youth came , took Rs 200 from him , and disappeared without any bargaining . Amiya headed for JK Market in Uttarpara . ""This jhinge will sell for Rs 16 and 20 a kilo,"" said Arun Banik of Seoraphuli. About 3km away, in the Mahesh retail market , jhinge was selling for Rs 12 a kg. Retailers here hinted that the vegetable prices in Kolkata are the basis of the calculation of dada-tax even in rural market . ""Thanks to mobile phones , information runs at lightning speed ,"" said district horticulture officer Dr Dipak Ghosh.At the end of the day, it is the phoreys and tolabaaj , who go home smiling  not the farmer in a village , nor the buyer in Kolkata . ""In fact , now when the government is trying to bring down the price of vegetables with greater vigil , there is more arm-twisting by these phoreys . They are threatening not to pick up our produce , forcing us to make distress sale. If they don't buy it, my vegetables will rot in the sack and my children will go hungry ,"" said Gaurab Karar , a farmer from Madpur . Is there a way out, apart from a crackdown on the tolabaaj? ""My suggestion to farmers is to change the crop pattern. They are bleeding because of over-dependence on crops like potatoes which are giving them diminishing returns every year . I got some farmers to cultivate cauliflower, cabbage, garlic and onion and the result was very encouraging ,"" said Ghosh."

Sugar prices jumped Rs 2-2.5 per kg in the first week of July after the levy quota for July, August and September was announced. The wholesale price of S-30 sugar in the Vashi market near Mumbai increased from Rs 2,850/quintal a week ago to Rs 3,080/quintal on Friday.""We expect prices to remain stable at this level in July and then increase again from September. Expectations of lower sugar production in the next season are also likely to keep the market firm,"" said Ashok Jain, president of the Bombay Sugar Merchants' Association.The NCDEX agri commodities index on Saturday closed 1.11% higher at 2,590.91, with maximum gains coming from products such as mustard seed, pepper, chana, coriander, cotton, jeera and refined soya oil.ACREAGE IN SOME COPS STILL DOWNVandana Narvekar, senior research analyst (agri commodities) at Angel Comtrade, said: ""Monsoon in July is critical for prices to remain at the normal level as 70% of the kharif crop is sowed this month. If this does not happen, prices of agri commodities may go up. International prices will also have an impact on edible oil and sugar prices.""Though the monsoon has advanced in some parts of India, acreage in certain crops is still down. Sowing of soyabean is down 25% and paddy acreage has fallen 26.3% till the end of last week. However, the acreage in pulses has gone up to 13.04 lakh hectares from 12.38 lakh hectares last year. The rise is significant because the area under cultivation was only 3.99 lakh ha by June end as against 6.08 lakh ha in the same period last year.Prices of spices have surged 15-20%, with turmeric taking the lead. Vegetable prices are expected to remain high at least till August as sowing has been delayed due to lack of adequate rainfall, said All India Vegetable Growers' Association President Shriram Gadhve.Wholesale prices of onion, one of the most common vegetables in India, has increased marginally by Rs 1-2 per kg due to delay in sowing. Potato prices have risen 15-20% in the last six weeks. Tomato acreage has come down about 20% in the Narayangaon-Sangamner belt in western Maharashtra and wholesale prices are at about Rs 12-15 per kg. In Delhi's Azadpur mandi, the wholesale price on July 5 was Rs 10/kg while retail prices are in the range of Rs 40-50 per kg.Anis Chakravarty, director and senior economist at financial advisory firm Haskins, Deloitte & Sells, said the monsoon will play a crucial role in July inflation numbers. ""The June inflation numbers are not yet out, but going by the price trend, food inflation may go higher, affecting the headline inflation numbers,"" he said.In May, inflation inched up to 7.55% from 7.23% in April. Edible oil prices have firmed up Rs 4-5 per litre amid a depreciating rupee. ""If rains don't improve by July 15, there will be a spurt in prices leading to reduced consumption,"" said Adani Wilmar COO Angshu Mallick.Pulses prices have firmed up in the domestic market, with consumption drastically falling, according to traders and processors. ""There has been a 20% fall in consumption of tur and chana dal in the past few months with an increase in prices. The delay in monsoon may further aggravate the situation,"" said Indian Pulses and Grain Association President Pravin Dongre.But the monsoon has progressed now across the parched fields of eastern Rajasthan, most parts of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.Rains will help speed up sowing of paddy in Punjab and Haryana and coarse grains and oilseeds in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. ""Rains have been delayed by 7-12 days in these states. But if these states continue to get good spell of rains periodically, a recovery is imminent,"" said RS Sharma, senior scientist at Agriculture Policy Research Institute."
217,The growth model has come undone,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-growth-model-has-come-undone/article3622126.ece,2012-07-10,The Hindu,"What has been called the golden age of Indias economic growth was underpinned by global integration, high rates of investment and savings growth and low current account deficits. The slowdown is characterised by a sharp deceleration in investment growth on the demand side and in agriculture, manufacturing and construction on the supply side, alongside high and unprecedented current account deficits.The governments argument that this is the result of the global economic slowdown and related uncertainty is only partly true. The deeper reason, which the government is either unwilling or unable to come to grips with, is the unravelling of the underlying growth model  partly due to structural change engendered by globalisation and partly because the investment subsidy implicit in under-pricing assets is no longer feasible.ImportsThe speed and depth of global integration accelerated sharply in the first decade of the 21st century. The average international trade (exports+imports) ratio which for the period 1992/3-94/95 stood at 19 per cent rose to 27 per cent by 2000/01-02/03. However by 2008/9-2010/11 this ratio had shot up to 48 per cent. But in this phase of rapid integration import elasticities  of both total imports as well as non-oil imports  have more than doubled. As a result, even as GDP growth has decelerated, goods export growth has slowed faster than both total goods import and non-oil import growth, resulting in a widening current account deficit, given that service sector exports growth dropped off as well.This increasing import dependence has affected the three major sectors asymmetrically because their integration into the global economy is very different. Manufacturing is the economys most integrated sector, with an average trade ratio for the period 2008/9-2010/11 of 180 per cent. For agriculture and services this stood at less than 20 per cent. Even if we consider the sub-sector financial and business services, its trade ratio was only 58 per cent . For manufacturing, both the pace and nature of its integration changed significantly in the first decade of the 21st century.The manufacturing sectors trade ratio in 1994/95 was 92 per cent. By 2000/01-2002/03 the ratio had risen to 112 per cent with the import ratio slightly higher than exports. This increase pales into insignificance as compared with that of the next decade when the average manufacturing trade ratio had risen to 180 per cent, with export and import ratios at 68 and 112 per cent. Therefore not only has integration increased sharply for the manufacturing sector but it has also been asymmetric  import penetration has almost doubled whereas export integration has increased by 20 per cent.Of the three sectors, however, manufacturing is the only one that runs a trade deficit. The deficit is substantial, the average for the period 2008/09-2010/11amounting to 44 per cent of manufacturing GDP and rising  the average was only 9 per cent for the period 2000/01-2002/03. Little wonder then that, in the face of continuing import competition, manufacturing growth has witnessed a sustained slowdown. And, as one would therefore expect, capacity utilisation has declined significantly, well off its third-quarter 2009/10 peak, as Reserve Bank of India surveys indicate.Investment growthOne of the more remarkable aspects of the golden age was that demand growth was investment-led, both in absolute and relative terms. In constant terms, over the period 2003/4-2007/8 gross investment grew at 17 per cent per annum, more than twice the rate of private consumption expenditure. What is historically unprecedented was that gross investment accounted for more than 50 per cent of demand growth at the margin. If the high growth phase was investment-led, so is the slowdown. Investment (gross) growth slowed down to 10 per cent p.a. for the period 2009/10-2011/12. The slowdown in fixed investment was even sharper, to 7 per cent p.a. over the same period, less than 50 per cent of that in the high-growth phase. The depth of the deceleration is brought home by the fact that in 2011/12 gross and fixed investment grew only at 5.8 and 5.6 per cent respectively. And, more worryingly, consumption has decelerated much less and, as a result, over the last couple of years, it has grown faster than investment, resulting in the decline of the critical investment-to-consumption ratio.Some part of investment slowdown surely has to do with the asymmetric increase in the integration of the manufacturing sector where import levels have increased five times faster than export levels. In other words, manufacturing growth has become very import dependent. The adverse effects of this dependence have become apparent with the global slowdown. Increased import competition now slows down sales growth of domestic firms, reduces capacity utilisation, puts pressure on margins and adversely affects expected profitability of the sector. The pressure on expected profitability affects investment in manufacturing. This in turn drags down overall investment growth given the under-appreciated fact that the sector accounts for the largest proportion of investment in the economy.Under-priced assetsIf the nature and pattern of integration has affected investment growth, Keynesian animal spirits have been dampened due to a factor quite unrelated to globalisation.During both the NDA and UPA-I regimes, an important driver of investment growth has been access to undervalued assets, whether those of the public sector, mineral and forest resources, land or the ability to influence the allocation of scarce spectrum resources. During the NDA regime, privatisation of public sector assets at fire sale prices stalled in the face of widespread political and social opposition. With privatisation off table, the UPA-I chose to use all other modes listed above to ensure that animal spirits were kept in ruddy health. The investment boom of the golden age, which roughly coincides with the UPA-I term, therefore, was primed by access to a wide variety of undervalued assets, ranging from land (SEZs, PPP infrastructure, etc.) to spectrum.In UPA-II, however, this dynamic has largely run aground, hemmed in by protests from below and corruption scandals. Widespread and sustained protest against the public acquisition of land for private purposes  Singur, Nandigram, POSCO, Jaitapur, just to name an iconic few  has made it a political hot potato which is to be re-legislated and at least for the moment is off-limits. The implementation of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) and introduction of new legislation to govern the distribution of benefits from mining suggests that mining leases may not be as easy to get nor as lucrative as earlier. Add to this the Niira Radia revelations, the 2G scandal, the Anna Hazare movement, the CAGs observations and Supreme Court rulings and it is not easy (at least as of the moment) to use elite access to influence the underpricing of assets. Therefore, all mechanisms used during UPA-I to under-price assets and give animal spirits a sufficiently conducive environment have become infructuous, being caught up in unintended political economy consequences.Finally, there is one other aspect of the slowdown that has had an impact on market growth, expected profitability and investment. Construction is one of the three sectors that has borne the brunt of the slowdown. As we know from the last large sample survey of the NSS, over this phase of jobless growth, the two sectors that did produce jobs were construction and business services. The slowdown in construction will therefore have had consequences for employment growth, slowing down domestic demand growth just when external markets have dried up, again adversely affecting expected profitability and investment.The nub, therefore, is that the investment-led growth model of the golden age has come undone and like Humpty Dumpty, the PMs men and women cannot put it back together again. The undoing is only partly the result of the global financial crises and the related slowdown. There are two other important reasons which the government does not talk about: globalisation has led to unsustainable import competition in the manufacturing sector, leading to a slowdown in manufacturing growth and hence in investment; second, the investment subsidy implicit in the under-pricing of assets in high demand is no longer feasible due to political economy reasons. As C.P. Chandrasekhar has articulated in earlier columns, it is of course possible to chart an alternate path and revive growth and investment. For that we would need to stop genuflecting before the fallen gods of finance capital. But that was too much to expect of the former finance minister or of the incumbent. There is, then, little else to do but to wait for the monsoons, capricious foreign investment or other such manna from heaven.(The author teaches economics at IIM Calcutta.

""We found a gap of Rs 5 to Rs 6 between the price of potatoes in wholesale and retail markets. We have asked the vendors not to exceed the retail price of potato beyond Rs 15, so as to contain the maximum difference between wholesale and retail price of potato at Rs 2 to Rs 2.5,"" said a senior officer of food supplies and consumer welfare department. The government has also asked all vendors to display the price of potato in front of their shops. The government will take stringent action against those found violating the orders, an official source said.Rajdhani Haat Byabsayee Sangh secretary Gayadhar Swain said, ""The main reason for the rise in potato price is due to the increase in demand of potato in the past few weeks. As vegetables have become untouchable, the demand for potato increased a lot but the supply was limited. Rise in the price of potato is due to demand-supply deficit.""Though people welcomed the government initiative to check the price of potatoes, they continue to be disappointed by the state government's silence on the skyrocketing vegetables prices. ""Recently the West Bengal chief minister asked vendors to reduce the price of vegetables, which has had some impact there, but no such step is being taken by our government. I agree that potato is an important ingredient in the kitchen but how long can we survive by eating potatoes alone? The prices of all vegetables are above Rs 40 per kilo,"" said Prabhakar Nayak, a government employee.Green chilies here continue to scorch at Rs 200 per kg, while other kitchen staples like brinjal, ladies finger, bitter guard at Rs 40 a kilo, parval at Rs 50, drumsticks at Rs 60 and tomato Rs 25 a kilo remain out of reach for many."

The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) started the 50-day Onam-Ramzan Metro Peoples Bazaar at Putharikandam Maidan here on Tuesday.The bazaar sells sugar, rice, vegetables, pulses and other groceries at subsidised rates, wiping away worry lines over the burgeoning prices. It will be welcome festive cheer without anxiety over expenses.A. Chandrika, Regional Manager of Supplyco, said the bazaar had been organised within five days. All Supplyco workers involved put in a lot of effort to get it under way, she said after Chief Minister Oommen Chandy inaugurated the fair.Ms. Chandrika said more tents would be put up in the 20,000-sq.ft area the City Corporation had allotted for the bazaar, giving space to cooperatives such as Milma, Kepco and Hantex to open stalls.Despite it being a working day, long queues formed in front of the stalls, with the bags of the buyers growing bulkier after every stop. With shelves and baskets getting rapidly depleted and products placed one after another on the electronic scales, business took off instantly.White rice (Maveli Sortex ) costs Rs. 16 a kg, half the market price of Rs.32. Sugar costs Rs. 25 a kg, lower than the Rs. 35 at other shops.

220,SDO late on ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120711/jsp/siliguri/story_15714369.jsp,2012-07-11,Telegraph,"Raiganj, July 10: The subdivisional officer of Raiganj today went to check vegetable prices in a local market, but too late to catch any vendors or shoppers. The team of officials led by subdivisional officer Nandini Saraswati went to Mohanbati market at 11am. Saraswati, along with Raiganj block development officer Subrata Paul and the block agricultural marketing officer went to the market accompanied by several policemen. But the place was virtually empty. The fruitless exercise to check the sale of vegetables at inflated rates, a drive initiated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, was criticised by the local people, the shopowners association and the district magistrate. Saraswati, however, found a woman who was doing her shopping and asked about the prices she had paid today. When she was told that chillies were being sold at Rs 80 a kg, Saraswati checked a price list she was carrying and found that it should be selling at Rs 60. When she asked for an explanation from the seller, she was told that the quality of chillies being sold were the best. The subdivisional officer then went to some other shops inquiring about the prices and the team was told that potato was selling at Rs 12 a kg, potol or wax gourd for Rs 10, ribbed gourd for Rs 20, brinjal at Rs 24 and ladys finger for Rs 16 a kg. People who had finished doing their groceries earlier in the morning claimed that they had been charged far above the prices that the traders told the officials. Prasanta Das, a resident of the Rabindrapalli area of the town, said he had been buying vegetables from the Mohanbati market for the past 15 years and most of the customers finished their round of the market between 7am and 10am. Today I went to the market at 8. 30am and bought potato at Rs 16 a kg. I paid Rs 25 for potol, Rs 100 for chillies, Rs 30 for brinjal. The shopkeepers are lying to the district officials, he said. Saraswati, when asked about why she and the others arrived at the market well past the peak hours, said it took time for everyone to gather at her office and that caused the delay. We had taken the decision to visit the market late last evening and it took some time for all of us to gather and go for the inspection. It is true that we arrived at the market past the peak time, but we have found out that the prices of the vegetables are under control, she said."

In the past three days, the prices of tomato, potato, ladyfinger, brinjal and other vegetables have gone up tremendously. The tomato, which was being sold for Rs 30 three days back, is now available for Rs 55 a kg. Prices of other vegetables have gave up. Potato which was available for Rs 14 a kg a couple of days back, is now being sold for Rs 20 a kg. This has burnt a bigger hole in the pocket of the people, who are finding it tough to manage the kitchen expenses.This situation has arisen as the fields are wet. This is not giving the farmers a chance to cultivate the fields. Also, the water accumulated in the fields has been damaging the crop. The trucks that come to wholesale 'mandis' in the city are also unloading less quantity of vegetable stock.In Govind Nagar, Kidwai Nagar, Shastri Nagar vegetable markets, tomato is being sold between Rs 50 and 60 a kg. In the vegetables markets of posh areas like Swaroop Nagar, the cost of vegetables is even higher.'Shimla mirch' is being sold for Rs 100 a kg.

We have initiated steps over the past few weeks that have ensured that speculative transactions do not take place,"" FMC chairman Ramesh Abhishek told TOI over the phone. Sources said the regulator was following price movements in the five commodities and any unusual trend would attract action.Commodity futures trading is essentially meant to help farmers and traders hedge their risks on a commodity, say wheat or rice, with contracts maturing a few months away. On Monday, the regulator announced an increase in the special margin for RM seed and soyabean. Together with the mandatory delivery requirements for most agricultural commodities, FMC expects speculative transactions to come down.Market players said compared to the situation a few months ago when a handful of market players had built speculative position, the situation has changed, which is showing in lower open-interest positions and lower volumes. Open interest refers to contracts that are outstanding.A few months ago, FMC had changed the rules to club the positions taken by related entities to counter complaints of speculation. For long, commodities trading has been blamed for rise in price of farm goods and with monsoon being deficient, some increase has been witnessed.Government officials concede that there may be some pressure on pulses such as tur and moong but overall, the situation is not as grim. In addition, some food products such as potatoes and chana had witnessed lower production during the winter season and are witnessing an increase in prices.On Tuesday, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said rice and wheat stocks were comfortable although he is keeping his fingers crossed on the pulses and oilseeds front."

230,CM van plan to seal market-farmer gap,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120718/jsp/bengal/story_15741732.jsp,2012-07-18,Telegraph,"Calcutta, July 17: Mamata Banerjee today said the agriculture marketing department would buy 100 refrigerated vans to help farmers bring their produce to wholesale markets and phase out aggregators who jack up vegetable prices and deny the cultivators a fair price. After a meeting with the task force  set up to maintain a vigil on vegetable prices  the chief minister said these vans will reduce the farmers dependence on aggregators. Funds to buy these vans will be made available from the local area development fund of our Rajya Sabha MPs. A large portion of the farm produce gets damaged before it is brought to the markets. These vans will help the farmers get the right price for and this will also bridge the gap between demand and supply of vegetables, she said. Senior officials said the primary job of the agriculture marketing department was to provide the necessary supply chain to link the markets with farmers. But nothing was done so far. If the proposal is implemented properly, it will definitely help the farmers. If the state wants to implement the facility properly, the modalities have to be fixed first, a department official said. It was also discussed at the meeting that despite efforts, the aggregators or middlemen were still playing an important role in the supply chain of vegetables. It was found that jhinge (ribbed gourd) was sold at Rs 6 a kg in wholesale markets yesterday but the vegetable was being sold at Rs 40 a kg in retail markets. This clearly hinted at how the aggregators are still playing a crucial role, another official said. The chief minister said the state would ensure farmers can sell their produce directly in the markets. In all blocks of the state, kisan markets would be set up where the farmers will sell their produce directly. This year, 95 such markets would be set up. Mamata claimed the task force had brought down prices of vegetables significantly, but the prices of potato could not be brought down because of forward trading and hoarding. Some people are manipulating the price of potato through forward trading and hoarding. The task force will work against such hoarders. But it is true that farmers have got proper price for potato this year, Mamata said."

Not just that, a 320 ml bottle of juice with it is all yours for free. This, at a noted supermarket near Rajajinagar Entrance. You may be excused for thinking it is a steal. Unfortunately, as always, theres a catch. The cheese balls are fast approaching their expiry date. Worse, you could have missed seeing the fine print and gone home congratulating yourself.So too a box of wheat malt with an MRP of Rs. 170, available for a mere Rs. 69. But then, you have to forcefully consume it within two days, as that is its expiry date.The Hindu, on a visit to random supermarkets, saw the various strategies, some bordering on the devious, to somehow push stuff which are about to cross the sell-by date.Two for the price of oneDespite recent raids by the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials on supermarkets, consumers continue to be short-changed.Some outlets in Indiranagar were found to be selling products that had already expired on a buy one get one free offer.At the supermarket near Rajajinagar Entrance, which belongs to a chain and was raided by the BBMP, a separate table had been set up to display products that were either to expire in a day or two or in the next few weeks. A salesperson was specially deputed to sell the old products.From packets of sambar powder and pickle bottles to sauces and jams besides snacks (such as puffed rice, potato chips) and even aerated beverages whose expiry dates were nearing were being sold at a 70 per cent discount along with an added offer of loyalty points. (Supermarkets tempt consumers with loyalty cards that enable them to win points for purchases and which can be used to get discounts for future buys.)Back in businessThe recent raids have not affected the functioning of the supermarkets. All the three outlets under the BBMPs scanner were back in business the next day after managers from these outlets met Commissioner M.K. Shankarlinge Gowda, BMMP sources said.Asked for an explanation, BBMP Joint Commissioner (Health) Salma Fahim told The Hindu the supermarkets were allowed to reopen as they had paid the penalty and had removed the expired stocks.Admitting that the BBMP was responsible for keeping a tab on implementing the Food Safety and Standards Act within the city limits, Ms. Fahim said the Palike would launch a drive to crack down on violations from July 20. Before that we have a two-day training workshop for our 108 health inspectors from July 18. The health inspectors will get all establishments dealing with food products registered under the Food Safety Act, she said.Buyer beware!Y.G. Muralidharan of Consumer Rights Education and Awareness Trust (CREAT) advised consumers to be alert.They should make it a habit to check the manufacturing and expiry dates before buying a product, especially food. With all the supermarkets being run by influential businessmen, it is a surprise if they are punished for violations. But consumers should not forget to register their complaints with the BBMP and consumer courts if they are being cheated, he added."
232,Low rainfall pushes prices of veggies in city,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/Low-rainfall-pushes-prices-of-veggies-in-city/articleshow/15036364.cms,2012-07-19,The Times Of India,"JAIPUR: The soaring food prices are burning a hole in the common man's pocket in the city. The low rainfall in key crop growing regions has spurred the talk of another food crisis.In the past one week, the wholesale prices of veggies have increased by nearly three times while the retail prices jumped to 100% in some cases.Tomatoes, which till a few days ago, was available for Rs 12-15 per kg is now priced at Rs 32-35 per kg in the wholesale market and Rs 45 per kg in the retail market.Similarly, coriander which was selling at Rs 30 per kg on July 13 is now available at double the rate at Rs 60 in wholesale markets.Rajasthan, which doesn't boast of high production of vegetables, is facing the brunt. The potato crop in South India has failed miserably and this has affected the supply in the state. The supply of onions and tomatoes from Nashik too has gone down.""During this time of the year, potatoes come from the southern parts of the country. However, due to the unpredictable monsoon, the production has dipped to 20%. Same is the case with most other vegetables. If ongoing condition prevails for another few days, the food supply situation is going to get worse,"" said Radheyshyam Pathak, president, Rajasthan Fruits and Vegetable Traders Association.It's not just vegetables, fruits too have become dearer. The pomegranate is selling at a whopping price of Rs 120 in retail against Rs 95 around 10 days ago. Mango, the seasonal fruit, is also getting out of the middle class' reach. A kg of mangoes is selling at Rs 45 in wholesale, highest in five years, and Rs 60 in retail.""In case of a drought-like situation, the rural population will be hit the hardest. The cost of vegetables and fruits is likely to hit the roof exclusive of the transportation charges,"" said Nagendra Khangarot, agriculture expert.The impact of scanty rainfall has started showing in terms of sowing of oilseeds and pulses. In Madhya Pradesh, the major producer of soybean, farmers have delayed the sowing process. The cardamom plantation is also likely to be hit in the South. Fearing a worse scenario, the price of commodities has surged.The price of moong which was Rs 60 per kg has now gone up to Rs 72 in retail. Urad has moved from Rs 62 to Rs. 74, while arhar has seen the steepest price rise from Rs 54 to Rs 75 per kg.""The price of pulses and oilseeds in India may rise further higher in next two weeks if the ongoing weather condition prevails and the sowing is delayed,"" said Babulal Gupta of Rajasthan Khadya Padarth Vyapar Sangh,As per consumer price index (CPI) released on Wednesday, the vegetables have become costlier by 27.60%, followed by edible oils (16.58%) and milk products (12.75%) in June compared to prices during June 2011. Prices of egg, fish and meat shot up by 11.65%, while pulses have become costlier by 9.34%."

They are all Trinamool Congress flag-bearers who have come all the way from rural Bengal to attend the party's July 21 martyrs day rally at Esplanade on Saturday. ""The government needs to address the poor field prices of potato and jute that are afflicting growers despite a good yield. And if the state government can't, there should be some definite reasons for it. Those need to be told to people clearly. We can't keep on blaming the Centre for it."" Dharani Roy said.Hailing from three north Bengal districts of Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar and North Dinajpur, Dharani is a Trinamool supporter since the party's inception, Sushandhu was with CPM till he switched flanks to Trinamool and Joydeb, by his own admission, was with Congress even a couple of years back. In their early sixties, the three have been trying hard to take the party to the ""grassroots"". So, as you speak to them at their makeshift ""home"" at the covered Salt Lake stadium galleries, their assessment of the party's requirements appears somewhere disconcerting to what their party leaders state in Kolkata. They'd love their leader to touch on their issues which confront them daily at their homes, while they extend the party footprints ""home by home.""""The 100-days work scheme and Kisan Credit Card are fine. But this is not enough. Even in a lower middle-class family, each member needs at least Rs 100 per day. That makes it Rs 6,000 or more per family every month at least for a two-member family. What purpose does Rs 1,200-1,500 serve them? Yes, it helps mending the village roads and ponds. But who is getting the work? Who is preparing the work roster? The gram panchayat pradhan - who in most cases still - is a CPM member or from the Congress,"" said Sudhangshu.Sudhanshu, a former CPM gram panchayat pradhan, said, ""Kisan Credit Card is a good step, but none from my village got it. Also, the government has to resolve an earlier mess for which many farmers are unable to get bank loans or credits. In the UPA tenure, the Centre had decided to waive off farm loans. That is a good seven-eight years back. Now, the rural co-oepartive banks from where we availed the loans are not giving us NOC for the loans. Without the NOC, a large section of farmers whose loans were waived then, haven't been able to get a single penny as fresh loan. Everyone says we've got a bad credit history. Will the Kisan Credit Card help us tide over the problem?""Joydeb's plea to Didi is more simple. ""The suspicion and infighting among ranks has to stop immediately. Aren't we from the same party? Don't we believe that Didi is our supreme leader? So, why this discontent among leaders, or have they become too greedy? The problem has started with the state ministers evolving as power centres in the districts they represent. They've become a parallel power structure, which already has a party hierarchy which ends with the district president. They end up taking conflicting stands on issue and the supporters are getting disillusioned. Some vested interests, who till the other day were with CPM, are actively cashing in on it. And we party workers are cutting a sorry figure,"" he said. ""Didi should be very strict with all these. A lot of pain and sacrifice - many by Didi herself - has led to this day and it can't be allowed to go waste only for the interest of a few people,"" he said.Dharani fears that the CPM and the Congress will reach at an understanding in the 2013 panchayat polls. ""They will not fight together but leave space wherever the other is strong. They've already started trumpeting that the winds of change are in the air. Didi has to take a strong step, if we fight the panchayat elections alone a decision has to be taken now. It leaves us with six-seven months to prepare. Didi should also expose this nexus. For people believe her.""Meanwhile, Mamata, on Facebook, wrote: ""On 21st July, we salute the Martyrs of different democratic movements. Let us bow our heads down, pay obeisance and remember their invaluable sacrifice and also take a pledge to rededicate ourselves to continue to fight for the cause of 'Maa Mati Manush' and build a harmonious, peaceful and prosperous Bengal, where the head is held high and the mind is without fear."""
234,2 chairs for UPA 2,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Masquerader/2-chairs-for-upa-2/,2012-07-24,The Times Of India,"No doubt there is a significant difference in the size of the chair required by His Excellency Pranabda, Mr Antony, and that for the Maratha strongman Mr Sharad Pawar. The discrepancy may not just be in physical dimensions, there may be a subtle political indication based on what is generally termed as ones standing and ability to throw ones weight around. For that matter, his own strong clout apart, Mr Pawar has been an old congressman, having left the Congress for reasons well spelt out at a particular time, but the issue never came up again. His NCP is perhaps the most consistent supporter of the UPA coalition. Astute, experienced, supremely diplomatic, and ambitious as he is, such a man is likely to be stalled at crucial step, particularly in a world of power and politics.Politicians score on various skills. Some win hearts by being polite, defensive and conceding at the cost of survival. Other win on manipulating vote bank politics, and promising more than can be delivered. These also know at first hand how to throw the blame on the rival for his continued indifference. Some play the game more comprehensively using divisive tactics, voter incentives, and keep smoldering fires well fanned.Mr Pawar willingly joined the UPA, though one cannot deny that he still continues to interact at a personal level with the Shiv Sena, BJP, and other regional parties. Years of experience has taught him to adopt just the stance where a slight tilt can allow him to join the rightists, leftists, the backwards, the regional forces, and the now the extremely influential India Inc. lobby. The man speaks less, chooses his words, and people generally get fearfully jittery when he reserves his comments when it is expected that he shall retort for an insulting denial.As the word goes, the great Yashwant Rao Chavan, Nehrus perpetual confidant considered Mr Pawar his Manas Putra, seeing his political potential. Much changes over time in a man, for better or worse if I may say so. As chief minister of Maharashtra, he finally bagged the seat from an equally capable Mr A R Antulay, who had to step down after the Indira Gandhi Pratisthan, a sort of a historical preamble and comparison to the present Adarsh, the only difference perhaps being that there was no such grand Mantralay to catch fire in due course, if certain rumors are still around.As agricultural minister in the UPA 2, though a man like Mr Pawar must have added adequate inputs, with his experience and knowledge of the capitalist as well as the farmer, his working style was not expected to change to the codes and principles on which UPA 2 operates, some of which might have been foreseen as the reasons why he left the party. That of course is not to blame anyone, just a style of functioning and internal equations.What comes to the fore is that food commodity items, including staple vegetables as onions and potatoes have seen an unprecedented inflation. The inability of the government to absorb and compensate the farmer during times of bumper crops remains a big question mark. It is not yet clear why a seasoned agricultural minister and a world class economist from an agricultural country did not act even in the line of sheer common sense. In response to a Supreme Court order that rotting food grains be distributed to the poor, the court was taken in confidence that such would cause a fall in the market prices and traders and wholesalers would suffer. I believe constitutionally the government is under obligation to protect every citizens interest, more so for the deprived segments. This was the time to revamp the rotting Public Distribution System. Put a regulatory body in place and enough checks and measures in place, in order to put this national lifeline of the poor in place. The PDS system was neither restored nor replaced by a more viable body. A free market economy idea is for a different turf. It does not waive away the basic responsibility that we would not have achieved much as long exercises to protect market forces are done at the cost of starving human lives.I do not know whether such governmental policies arose out of a single departments projection, or was it a sum total of the intransigence within the components of the coalition. No public explanation was offered, and there was less the press or publicity agencies did on this. The impending drought situation today shows that nothing beyond software, scams, and surreptitious deals was the main pre-occupation of those entrusted with primary responsibility of caring for every citizen usurped the minds of recent governments.Without siding with anyone the chair incidence, was rather petty at the highest level of politics in the nation. No-one becomes an unchallenged hero or a successor by which side or how many spaces he sits beside the PM. Perhaps what matters is who stands behind. But may be this is an excuse for non performance.Politics in this country has changed. The farmer is aware of what he invests, what he gets, and what is the price his product sells finally. The student is aware of the financial burden of just getting a certification, forget true education. The ageing government servant is aware of the petty pension against the rising inflation and the huge medical bills.I do not know if alternative governments perceived or predicted would be any better. People who have reached the pinnacle of power and position need to deal with each other more maturely. The country cannot wait for them to sign their personal treaties, and even if that be so, it should not hamper systems and programs running, and more on the anvil.The chair incidence may be used to highlight that executive performance is much beyond a governments pecking order. Have two chairs if that solves the problem, but stick to the common purpose of development.Much has been deprived to the common on the basis of compulsions of a co-alition or is it the lack of maturity to work together as one people for a vast nation. The talent is there, the co-ordiantion misses out.Finally, putting the blame on time and circumstances, do we have, or did we ever have an agricultural policy? Let future aspirants spell it out succinctly. It shall be a winner!"
235,'Government favouring fertilizer companies not farmers',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Government-favouring-fertilizer-companies-not-farmers/articleshow/15151129.cms,2012-07-26,The Times Of India,"NAGPUR: Organic farming experts launched a scathing attack on central and state governments for promoting the fertilizer and pesticide companies at the cost of farmers. The five experts said that even though there was clear evidence that use of pesticides was the basic cause of agrarian crisis, government was encouraging farmers to use more of it.G V Ramanjaneyulu, executive director of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA), told media that 10 lakh farmers living in 10,000 villages are doing organic farming in 35 lakh acres without using chemical pesticides and fertilizers with the help of Andhra Pradesh government. ""These farmers are earning far more than what they used to when they were using chemical fertilizers. In last fiscal year, Bihar had a record production of rice and potato using organic farming. This is a clear evidence that organic farming does not reduce production.""Interacting with mediapersons in 'Meet the Press' organized by Nagpur Union of Working Journalists (NUWJ), Ramanjaneyulu further said that several studies had pointed out that the use of chemicals have poisoned food and groundwater. ""There are 67 pesticides that are banned in all countries except India.""The expert further pointed out that while use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers increased the cost of production, the price of crops was not increasing. ""As a result farming is no longer a sustainable occupation.""Ramanjeyulu pointed out that the price of fertilizers was increasing every year. ""In 2008 a bag of phosphate costed Rs200 but now it is Rs1,200. But the government has not increased the subsidy.""M S Kairon, ex-chairman of Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR) said that Indian government was promoting US pattern of agriculture without giving a thought. ""The total cost of cotton produced by US last year was $3 billion. Against this US government gave a subsidy of $4 billion to farmers. What more evidence does our government need,"" he asked.Agricultural expert Ramesh Thakre said that there was an acute shortage of fertilizers in the country. The government was simply not considering this fact. Manohar Parchure, member of Organic Farmers' Association, said that world would run out of Phosphorus and Potash in another twenty years. ""Unless we start planning from now, a switchover at the last moment won't be possible."" Datta Patil, director of social organization YUVA and farm activist Kishor Tiwari also highlighted the plight of farmers caused as a result of excessive use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers."

In some cases, the rise is so sharp that it borders on alarm.As the man in the street grapples with the growing burden, the government claims to have put in place a contingency plan to deal with the consequences of a deficient southwest monsoon.Though it has been more than seven weeks since the monsoon set in , official statistics show that rainfall remains deficient by 22 per cent in parts of the country. Kharif sowing is 14 per cent lower than last year, owing to the lesser coverage of coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds, largely in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat.The Centre is considering steps to augment the availability of essentials in the open market, especially of coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds, and enhance grain allocation through the Public Distribution System. Besides vegetables and fruits, these commodities are showing a steep hike in prices.According to official data, the retail price of groundnut oil, for instance, has shot up to Rs.167 a kg in Delhi markets, from Rs.128 in the corresponding period last year. Mustard oil has gone up to Rs.103 a kg from Rs. 78. Soyabean oil is selling at Rs. 95 a kg and sunflower Rs.107, up from Rs. 83 and 93 last year. Vanaspati has shot up to Rs. 88 a kg from Rs.77.Sugar price has escalated to Rs. 38 a kg and is likely to go up further. It was Rs. 33 a year ago on July 25. Jaggery has gone up to Rs. 42 a kg from Rs. 35. All pulses prices are showing a rising trend. Gram dal has jumped to a whopping Rs. 65 a kg from Rs. 38, while tur is up to Rs. 74 a kg from Rs. 69. Masoor dal is priced at Rs. 60 a kg, as against Rs. 53 last year. Even loose tea has spiralled to Rs. 174 a kg from Rs. 154. Potato is selling at Rs. 21 a kg, against Rs. 11 a year ago.Experts reckon that unless the government moves in quickly to augment supplies and check hoarding, the prices will hit the roof."

This year,however,it has been delayed. The vegetable prices have increased by 20 per cent over the last one month. If Himachal Pradesh,Haryana and UP receive good rainfall in the next few days,the prices will hopefully come down by August 15, said Mahinder Kumar,a member of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) at Azadpur.The supplies of tomatoes and peas mostly come from Himachal Pradesh whereas other vegetables such as potatoes,onions and cauliflower come from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.While the wholesale prices of vegetables like brinjal and ladys finger have increased by Rs 2-4 since June,the prices of tomato and potato have seen a substantial hike.At the Azadpur wholesale market,potatoes cost Rs 12 per kg on June 1. The price has increased to Rs 21.25 on July 23. Potato prices increased from around Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg within a month.Similarly,the price of tomatoes has shot up to Rs 26 from Rs 9 per kg the previous month. The retail prices of tomatoes have seen a rise of more than Rs 20 per kg in the past month  from Rs 25 in June to Rs 40 in July.The cost of cauliflower on July 23 stood at Rs 25 per kg as opposed to Rs 17.50 on June 1. The retail rates for the vegetable has gone up from Rs 50 per kg in June to Rs 65 in July.APMC chairman Rajendra Kumar Sharma said the vegetable prices have been on the higher side this year.The delay in monsoon had caused the hike in prices but the rates will come down in approximately 15-20 days. The prices of some vegetables have already seen a slight fall, he said.Among the vegetables that have seen a marginal drop of Rs 1-2 are cauliflower and tomatoes.Delhi received only five days of rainfall in June against an average of seven days for the month,said Met department officials. Average rainfall for the the month was way below at 15.5 mm against an expected of average of 65.5 mm.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Tiruchi district is home to a number of vegetables. While banana is raised in 9,000 hectares, onion covers about 3,000 hectares, tapioca 6,000 hectares, and other vegetables, including brinjal, tomato, chillies, snake gourd, drumstick, and lemon are raised in total in about 2,000 hectares.On Thursday, even at the retail level, tomato was quoted around Rs.14 a kg (Rs.20 for 1.5 kg), drumstick Rs.20 a kg, brinjal Rs.10 to 12 a kg, ladies finger Rs.10 a kg, onion Rs.12 a kg, green chillies Rs.12 a kg, ribbed gourd Rs.15 a kg, cauliflower Rs.15 a piece, cabbage Rs.10 a kg, potato Rs.23 a kg, banana Rs.10 for six pieces, and coriander Rs.5 a bundle.Except onion, the price of other vegetables are said to be far lower than what it was a few days ago.Official sources, who do not want to be identified, attribute this to a number of farmers switching over to vegetables from paddy as water has become a serious issue in the region. It is quite possible that they might feel that they would be able to manage with the ground water if they were to raise only vegetables, they added. In addition, there could have been substantial arrivals from various other places too.N.Selvaraj, a vegetable farmer from Devanoor in Thathaiyengarpet block, says the first reason is that there are no Hindu marriages during the entire month of Aadi (which commenced during the third week of July) and there would be hardly any major function during this period.He points out that apart from a number of farmers switching over to vegetable crops, the major reason for the current trend is that quite a few have gone in for drip irrigation which has been quite successful.Whoever has opted for drip irrigation is virtually able to get double the yield, he asserts.According to him, farmers who could harvest hardly 10 tonnes per acre of tapioca under conventional irrigation method are now able to get as much as 20 tonnes.In Thathaiyengarpet block of Musiri taluk alone, at least 500 to 600 acres, usually well-irrigated areas, have already been selected to go in for drip irrigation with the help of the agriculture department. In addition, almost an equal area would come under drip irrigation using the private sources of the farmers. This is used for raising turmeric and onion also. The price of onion touched even Rs.2 a kg during the third week of July, he says.Mr.Selvaraj, who is also a seed farmer, says that water scarcity has already forced a substantial number of farmers to switch over from paddy. In our depot at Thathaiyenagarpet, we used to sell 25 tonnes of paddy seeds this time every year. This year we have not been able to sell even 10 tonnes which is a clear indication of the hesitation of the agriculturists to go in for paddy.He says farmers are extremely grateful to Prof. Vadivel of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University for encouraging them to take up cultivation of onion and banana instead of sticking to the traditional paddy. He has definitely played a crucial role in our prosperity, he adds.The unexpected boon to the farmers of the district this year is the cultivation of coleus, which has medicinal properties. Against the cultivation cost of about Rs.50, 000 per acre, it is able to fetch as much as Rs.2.5 lakh as private companies have entered into a contract promising Rs.25,000 per tonne. These companies are exporting the same as powder. Already coleus has been raised in 60 acres and contract has been signed for 300 more acres, Mr.Selvaraj adds."

""This is because of poor rainfall in areas producing vegetables and there is possibility of a further hike in their prices,"" an official of Goa state horticultural corporation said.The price of tomatoes has shot up to Rs 30 per kg from Rs 20 per kg a few days back, while potatoes are being sold at Rs 22 to Rs 25 per kg, up from Rs 20 per kg a few days back.The price of carrot has witnessed sharp fluctuations, as the vegetable is being sold between Rs 80 and Rs 90 per kg, up from Rs 70 to Rs 80, just a few days back. ""The difference in price is as much as Rs 20,"" the official said. ""We would buy carrots, but cannot afford them anymore,"" housewife Bianca Dias said.Cluster beans have also become dearer and are being sold at Rs 30 per kg. ""A week back, they were being sold for Rs 25 per kg,"" a source said. French beans have gone beyond the reach of the common man with prices shooting up to around Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg, as against Rs 25 to Rs 32 per kg. But prices may fall, sources said.Cabbages are being sold at Rs 22 kg, up from Rs 18 per kg some days back while lady fingers have risen to Rs 32 per kg from Rs 20 per kg last week. A piece of cauliflower is selling at Rs 24 whereas one could fetch it for Rs 18 just some days back.The prices of spring onions, cucumber and other vegetables have risen up, but coriander, spinach, lemons are a few of the items which are stagnant or shown a downward trend.Though fish prices should not have hit the roof, as demand usually drops during the Shravan month, portions of the much-sought after side dish as a fried item or to season the curry are selling at high prices. ""With one portion of prawns, there was enough quantity to cook for two separate meals, but the quantity has now shrunk so much that only one meal is possible,"" housewife Shruti Desai said.Agreed Shivnath Naik, who does the shopping for his family in the city. ""We used to balance out rice plate with fish and vegetables, but there is not much we buy now with the buying capacity of the rupee shrinking so much,"" he said.The prices of other fish items are quickly edging out of the harried common man's reach. Only four to five small mackerels can be bagged for Rs 100, while small portions of sardines and silver fish cost upwards of Rs 50, and shrimps are commanding Rs 100 for a very meager portion.The prices of beef and mutton have, however, remained stagnant at Rs 160 per kg and Rs 350 per kg, but chicken prices have soared from Rs 90 per kg to Rs 120 per kg.If that's not enough to spoil your meal, the dessert too is leaving a bad taste in the mouth. Prices of the common man's fruit, the banana, have also shot up. A dozen of the local variety cost Rs 50, while the Moira bananas are being sold at Rs 50 per kg (6 pieces).Elaichi bananas are not available at some of the Goa horticulture outlets. ""If available they are being sold at Rs 50 per dozen,"" a housewife said."
240,"Vegetables, fruits cost 25% more this fasting season",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Vegetables-fruits-cost-25-more-this-fasting-season/articleshow/15221397.cms,2012-07-28,The Times Of India,"After a few months of having hit a comfortable plateau , prices of vegetables and fruits have risen substantially by 20-25 % on an average this week, owing to the onset of Shravan and Ramzan on July 20 and 22, respectively.As before, there is no shortage of produce despite the higher demand. Yet, in the absence of a regulatory mechanism to stem artificial price rise, vendors have increased their profit margin on all food items, say market observers. In fact, sellers had been cautioning customers for a while that prices would rise during Shravan and Ramzan.On Friday, sugar rose by Rs 3 from Rs 36 to Rs 39 per kg. This, at the start of the fasting season when both Hindus and Muslims tend to eat but one meal a day, and sweets are an essential part of the menu.The most expensive item in percentage terms is the staple tomato, which for weeks has remained at giddying heights of Rs 32-40 per kg, three times more than the average of Rs 10-12 . Potato costs Rs 18-20 , up from an average of Rs 10-12.""Devout Hindu families stop consuming meat during Shravan and eat one vegetarian meal a day. Naturally, this repast is a little more elaborate than usual and comprises two or three different vegetables . But the fact that we are now buying staple items like tomato for Rs 40 and potato for Rs 20 compels us to consume less. After all, these are an unavoidable part of every recipe. We are forced to restrict the menu for this reason or frequently repeat items that are less expensive,"" says Anju Mhatre, who shops at the Four Bungalows market in Andheri.Few escape routes are available, though. Since the holy month of Shravan began July 20, even the common cabbage , bottle gourd and bitter gourd come for nothing less than Rs 40 per kg, up from the Rs 30 average. Popular items like cauliflower and cluster bean (gavar) have hit the Rs 50-60 mark once more after selling for Rs 40 in the pre-festival season. Green peas are back to their exalted pedestal of Rs 100 after a welcome interval where they cost Rs 40 per kg.""The surprise relief is lady finger, which has returned to its normal average of Rs 40 per kg for the first time in two years almost. It had scaled abnormal levels of Rs 80-100 earlier this year and sold for Rs 60 for the most part of 2010-11 ,"" says Goregaon resident Sunita Gavankar.Fruits, which form an integral part of the fasting ritual for both communities, have risen arbitrarily as well. Common varieties of mango such as langda, payri and dussehri that sold for Rs 50-60 per kg around July 15 suddenly shot up by Rs 20 to Rs 70-80 per kg. Watermelon, which is a must-item on the iftar menu owing to its high water content , is selling for Rs 30 per kg versus Rs 20 earlier. An average sized melon weighs around 2.5 kg. Every variety of apple, pear and pomegranate also costs marginally higher, and is likely to remain so until August 20.Bella JaisinghaniMumbai: The market for non-vegetarian food seesaws each time the fasting festivals of both communities fall simultaneously. Typically, Hindus forego meat and eggs during Shravan and Ganeshotsav while Muslims gravitate towards these after the arduous fast of Ramzan.Over the past week, eggs rose then fell by Rs 6-8 per dozen. ""The retail price of eggs had risen to Rs 48-50 before July 20. However, the advent of Shravan has seen prices fall to the average rate of Rs 40-44 ,'' says Nasir Ahmed of Nazeer Eggs.However, mutton and chicken prices remain stable at Rs 300 and Rs 80-110 per kg. Roadside shops selling broiler chicken start at Rs 80-90 per kg while the packaged variety sells for Rs 110, on an average. The price of mutton remains most stable and seldom fluctuates during festival time.While the supply of meat remains steady, the rainy season that ushers in several Hindu festivals does not bring an abundance of choice for fish lovers. ""There is little stock in the market owing to the monsoon ban on fishing so certain varieties do command a premium. Only frozen fish from Gujarat is being sold right now. Many of our regular buyers are fasting so sales will remain abysmal for the next three weeks,"" said a vendor at the Andheri municipal market.On Sunday, small piles of red prawns were available for Rs 100 while the regular mackerel and pomfret were hardly visible. ""There are times during Shravan when one gets fish really cheap because vendors opt for distress sales on days when there are no customers ,'' said Anshul Bhatia who came shopping with his wife. ""This time, there is little variety to choose from.''The Kolis as well as their customers are waiting for Nariyal Purnima when fishing will resume and the market will regain footfalls."
241,Samosas for every palate and wallet,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Samosas-for-every-palate-and-wallet/articleshow/15219194.cms,2012-07-28,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Your Lahore visit will cost just a bit more now. The city's samosas, price shackled by a three-year-old government order, are now free to fly on the wings of demand and supply.Till Tuesday morning, you could have bought a samosa anywhere in the city for the equivalent of Rs 3.5  30% less than the cheapest Delhi samosa but level with those at Kolkata's SN Banerjee Road. That was before the Pak supreme court struck down the Punjab government's 2009 order to fix the price of a samosa at six Pakistani rupees.Now, as members of Pakistan's Punjab Bakers and Sweets Federation draw up their pricing strategy, they can draw useful lessons from halwais in Delhi. Here, samosas are available for Rs 5-50, indicative of their status as not only the aam aadmi's snack but also a comfort food in the corridors of business and power.The fried triangle has even aided Bollywood romances. In the 1997 David Dhawan film Mr and Mrs Khiladi, Akshay Kumar romps about declaring his love to be as eternal as the potato-stuffed snack (jab tak rahega samose mein aloo/ Tera rahunga, o meri Shaalu).During Bihar elections in the same decade, sloganeers found the rhyming potential of Lalu and ""samose mein aalu"" too delicious to resist.Is it possible, then, to regulate a snack as versatile as the samosa? At roadside tea stalls, samosas are usually priced at Rs 5. In Old Delhi's Matia Mahal market, Ameer Sweet House sells juicy keema samosas for Rs 5 and khoya-stuffed, sweet ones for Rs 7. Not very far away, Delite Cinema has a massive 200g 'maha samosa' priced at Rs 40. Bangla Sweet House in Gole Market has a regular potato samosa priced at Rs 10 and a matar-paneer one at Rs 14. In the same market, Kaleva sells the very same aloo samosa at Rs 12 per piece.At central Delhi's Bengali Sweet House, bite-sized cocktail samosas are sold by the kilo  there is the regular matar samosa at Rs 240/kg and Allahabadi samosa with dry masala stuffing at Rs 190/kg.Chandni Chowk's Manohar Dhaba, known for its ""japani samosa""  famous for being neither Japanese nor a samosa  serves the classic version of the snack at Rs 10 with a side dish of chhole.Satish Agrawal of Bengali Sweet House says the noodles-stuffed 'Chinese samosa' they briefly introduced last year was priced at Rs 16.Samosa economics is serious business and Agrawal puts it in perspective. ""The price varies with the kind of samosa. But the location of a shop and the services it offers also go into deciding the price point. A roadside shop can sell cheaper. In a sit-down place, they have to incorporate the price of the additional chutneys, paper napkins, paper plates and even VAT,"" he says.A popular cafe chain with a large youth following has introduced a new ""combo offer"" that will make traditionalists happy  the samosa and chai combo.Of course, since you will be served in china plates by a staff that will take your order in English, you need to shell out Rs 49 for the ""experience"".Chhotu, who brings you your daily cutting chai in a wire stand, carefully balancing samosas wrapped in an oil-soaked newspaper in the other hand, will surely have a good laugh over this.Chances are, somebody will be served a samosa on this very article."

But now she does not get enough to last for three days. The skyrocketing prices of vegetables have come as yet another blow for the people already reeling under high inflation rate, mainly due to hike in the prices of the foodgrains and fuel. However, what has left people puzzled is the difference between the wholesale and retailer prices.Two weeks back, tomato was available in the local mandis at around Rs 20 per kg but now the price has hit Rs 50. However, the wholesale price of tomato at present is Rs 30-32 per kg. In super markets, the same tomato is available for Rs 45 per kg. Similarly, potato prices have also doubled in the past 15 days. At present, the potato rate in mandis is Rs 20 per kg, wholesale Rs 12-14 per kg and in super market Rs 16-17 per kg.The price of lady finger in local mandis is Rs 25 per kg and super market Rs 27-30 per kg, whereas in wholesale it is available for Rs 12 per kg. Coriander is selling at Rs 200 per kg in retail -- double the the wholesale price of Rs 100 per kg. In super markets, however, the price is Rs 120 per kg. Same is the case with onion.""Earlier, Rs 50-60 was enough to spend at a sabzi mandi. But today even with Rs 150- 200 in hand you will not be able to buy same quantity of vegetables,"" said Beena Verma, a housewife, shopping at Nishatganj mandi. Ruchika, a college student, who had come to buy vegetables at Narhi, said that the surprising part is that even the seasonal vegetables were costly. Anupma Khattri said ""Earlier, rates of vegetables at super market were reasonable earlier, but have shot up in the past few days.However, I still prefer super market because it saves time."" On the other hand, Rita Singh, said that she has started going to wholesale market once a week. But, she added, in wholesale one doesn't get a choice to select. ""One has to buy the whole lot piled in front of you,"" she said.Many people who supply tiffin to hostels are also facing tough time due to hike in the price of vegetables. Maya, who runs a tiffin service for working girls and students at Gomtinagar, said, ""My customers complain that I am not providing them variety of vegetables. I charge Rs 20 per meal and it is not possible to meet the cost. I try to balance the demand through rajma, curries, kachhauri and other things instead of regular meals. ""Many families have cut down on their outings to keep expenses under control. ""The prices of all the items are going up and it is increasingly becoming difficult for the salaried class to stick to the family budget,"" said Ramesh Srivastava, an executive in a telecom company.President of vegetable and fruits grower association Satish Sonker, when contacted, said, ""prices have shot up recently in the retail because of increase in the transportation cost. Also, the shelf life of some vegetables in rainy season is less. However, vegetable vendors complained that lot of money is pocketed by the middlemen who buy from the wholesale and supply to the retailers.""The network of middlemen in wholesale market is so strong that without their consent, farmers cannot unload their produce in the mandis and vendors cannot buy directly from the wholesalers. These middlemen fix the purchase and sales price,"" said Raju Sonkar, a vegetable vendor in Nishatganj. ""Many vendors buy from the suppliers, who are also middlemen,"" he added."

Sriramulu, MLA and founder of BSR Congress, has appealed to the public to support his party stating that if his party came to power, it would ensure remunerative prices for all agricultural produce.The price of the crops would be fixed during sowing itself and his government would purchase the crops if the prices in the market were less than what was fixed by the government.Mr. Sriramulu was addressing the public at a meeting in Hassan, held as part of his Sankalpa Yatra, on Tuesday. He also addressed the public in Arsikere, Hassan and Belur on Tuesday.He was received by party followers in Hassan at Dairy Circle, from where he was taken in a procession on B.M Road. He garlanded the statues of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Hemavati and also visited the Hasanamba temple before addressing a gathering.All these years the government had failed to provide remunerative prices for agricultural produce. The BSR Congress will provide remunerative prices. We will do what no government has been able to provide in the country so far, he said. Free education for poor children and 12-hour power supply in rural areas were among the other promises he made.Mr. Sriramulu also raised issues particular to Hassan. He said he was aware of the problems faced by coconut and areca growers in the district.The support price of Rs. 6,000 per quintal of copra fixed by the government was insufficient. The potato growers in the district were facing huge losses owing to the governments negligence, he alleged.Partys womens wing president and actor Rakshita said that the people of Hassan had been facing many problems, including bad roads, despite electing political bigwigs. She appealed to the public to support BSR Congress so that their living conditions would improve."
245,Task force to probe fruit prices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Task-force-to-probe-fruit-prices/articleshow/15321438.cms,2012-08-02,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday asked agricultural marketing officials and police authorities to inquire the reason behind the sudden rise in prices of fruits. the and find out what had led to the huge increase in price of fruits in the market.Prices of fruits have shot up enormously, especially for apple, papaya, mangoes and cucumber. Even as the mango season is almost over and price hike may be justifiable to some extent, for the other fruits, the hike has been exorbitant.The CM asked the task force, formed last month, - formed to keep a tab on the price of fruits and vegetables -to check why there was a gap between the wholesale and retail market prices of fruits, a senior official said. Besides fruit prices, Mamata is also worried about the cost of potatoes that continues to be steep.TNNEfforts have to be strengthened to get all fruits uninterrupted from north Bengal, the CM instructed officials. The CM expressed worry about the prices of fruits going up and there being no signs of the price of potato coming down.The government has hence decided not to send potatoes outside Bengal for the time being due to fears of a further price increase.The CM wants to make sure that local demands are first met. if local demands could not be met with.The decision was taken at the meeting of the task force, chaired by the CM. The agricultural marketing minister Arup Roy, the department secretary Subrata Biswas and city police commissioner RK Pachnanda were also present at the meet.The task force was formed afresh last month after prices of vegetables kept increasing. The vegetable prices have since then come down relatively, but potato continues to be Rs 15-16 per kg.Therefore, it was decided that the domestic demand of potatoes would first have to be catered to from the 32 lakh tonne potato that are in store in the state.Potatoes are sold from Bengal to many states like Odhisa, Bihar, Jharkhand, and other northeastern states like Assam and so on.West Bengal requires 5.5 lakh tonne of potato per month, and the new potato will be ready only in November.

Prices of fruits have shot up enormously, especially for apple, papaya, mangoes and cucumber. Even as the mango season is almost over and price hike may be justifiable to some extent, for the other fruits, the hike has been exorbitant.The CM asked the task force -- formed to keep a tab on the price of fruits and vegetables -- to check why there is a gap between the wholesale and retail market prices of fruits, a senior official said. Efforts have to be strengthened to get all fruits uninterrupted from north Bengal, the CM instructed officials. Mamata Banerjee has expressed worry about the prices of fruits going up and there being no signs of the price of potato coming down.The state government, meanwhile, has also decided not to send potatoes outside Bengal for the time being due to fears of a further price increase if local demands could not be met with. The decision was also taken at a meeting of the task force.The task force was formed afresh last month after prices of vegetables kept increasing. The vegetable prices have since then come down relatively, but potato continues to be Rs 15-16 per kg. Therefore, it was decided that the domestic demand of potatoes would first have to be catered to from the 32 lakh tonne potato that are in store in the state.Potatoes are sold from Bengal to many states like Odhisa, Bihar, Jharkhand, and other northeastern states like Assam and so on.West Bengal requires 5.5 lakh tonne of potato per month, and the new potato crop will be ready only in November. Therefore, there will be 22 lakh tonne potato required for the Bengal market till then. Another 5 lakh tonne is required for seeds. According to an official, there is enough supply of potato for people in the state till November, when the cold storages have to be vacated. Apart from the CM, agricultural marketing minister Arup Roy, the department secretary Subrata Biswas, city police commissioner RK Pachnanda were also present at the meeting.Later, Roy said that if the local demand can be fulfilled, and there is no pressure, then there are possibilities that the price of potatoes at the local markets may see a fall. If the situation improves, then the decision not to send potato outside the state may be reviewed again, said an official."

Impressing upon the farmers to keep the track of the prevailing market prices of potato along with maintaining balanced supply,AMIC In-Charge Dr Jagrup Singh Sidhu suggested that all the cold stored potatoes should be released before the arrival of the fresh potato crop in the markets during December.Dr Sidhu said that during 2011-12,potato production declined by 15 to 20 per cent in the major potato producing states,due to inclement weather near harvesting during the months of January and February. Consequently,the potato prices started escalating every month since April 2012 due to dwindling potato stocks in the cold stores,he said,adding that this trend may continue till November.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Police and task force members have been asked to take action in this regard.Rabindranath Koley,general secretary,Forum of Traders Organsiation of West Bengal and a member of the task force,said the CM has taken this step as the price of potatoes is still in the range of Rs 15 per kilo.According to the latest figures from Garihata,Manicktala and Hatibagan markets,the price of potato es is between Rs 14 and Rs 16 per kilo.Officials of the agriculture department,however,added that as of now around 32-33 lakh metric tonnes of potatoes are kept in cold storages to meet the demand of the next four months and till new varieties of potatoes reach the market in November.

They will not bring out nearly 15 lakh tonne potatoes from 469 cold storages during this period. The Samiti demands withdrawal of the government's decision to ban potato export to other states.State agricultural marketing minister Arup Roy, however, assured the government will do all it takes to keep down potato prices. ""I'll hold a meeting with the Samiti on Monday. We will try to address their concerns. But the government will not tolerate any further hike of prices. Potato price should be around Rs 12 per kg, it is still higher by Rs 2-3.""Explaining the government's stand, Roy said, ""For farmers' benefit, we've allowed the cold storage owners to keep potatoes for a month more than the November, 2011, deadline. And we'd also provided them Rs 8 per quintal subsidy to make up for the increased costs due to it. Moreover, the chief minister has already announced an export subsidy and instructed these potatoes to be used for the mid-day meal scheme. We are also conscious that the stocked potatoes should not go waste.""The problem, however, is elsewhere. The Samiti's state president Lalu Mukhopadhyay claims, ""For example, in West Midnapore, nearly 500 truckloads of potato move out of the 73 cold storages everyday. Of these only 30 trucks head for Kolkata, the rest go to other states. Police are stopping these trucks at checkposts and sending them back, but not before slapping cases of overloading etc. This year, there is 51 lakh tonne of potatoes in the cold storages. The state has to withdraw its decision to ban export of potatoes to other states, else we will start a ceasework. On the final day, we will also take to the streets in protest.""West Bengal Cold Storage Association (WBCSA)'s former president Patit Pawan De explains, ""This year Bengal had a lesser potato harvest. Against the one crore-lakh metric ton (MT), the potato production this year was only 85 lakh crore MT. The problem also arose with the high-potato producing states Punjab and Uttar Pradesh having reduced harvest - and therefore high potato prices themselves - so the influx of these to Kolkata was very low."" De also says it isn't only traders who stock potatoes in cold storages but also cultivators. ""Their share, however, is very little,"" he said. The minister expressed hope the impasse would be resolved."
250,A dosa by any other taste,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/a-dosa-by-any-other-taste/,2012-08-06,Indian Express,"The humble breakfast staple is evolving,with new Bangalore outlets offering twists on the traditional recipeThere is a new buzz around a humble staple that is a ubiquitous fixture on the breakfast and evening tiffin in many south Indian homes and restaurants. Chefs at haute dining destinations are giving it a new spin. Street food vendors are experimenting with it. The allure of the thin rice-and-lentil pancake has traversed the Vindhyas,making it one of the few dishes with pan-Indian appeal.The dosa and its dressed up cousin,the masala dosa,are even showing up on quirky lists such as the Huffington Posts Ten Foods From Around the World to Try Before you Die. There,it is the only Indian dish listed alongside Greek moussaka,French escargot and Peking Duck. A subcontinental meal that could persuade a committed carnivore to order vegetarian,it raves. The masala dosa was on last years list of the worlds 50 most delicious foods compiled by CNNGo.The masala dosa is a stand out,it is a delicacy India can be proud of, says Bangalore-based dosa diehard Pavandeep Singh. Singh and his two friends,George Seemon and Mario Jerome,recently launched Love Sex Aur Dosa,a group dedicated to weekly restaurant outings themed around the dosa. These outings are then documented on Facebook and Twitter where the weeks-old group has amassed hundreds of followers.Ours is not a protest against corruption,it is not a morcha to save the environment, says Geroge Seemon,an architect and co-founder of Love Sex Aur Dosa. Who would not want to be part of a dosa adventure? The groups open-to-all Sunday morning meet ups at dosa eateries attract an eclectic bunch of people. When it comes to a dosa tasting,the group will balk at nothing  a hospital canteen is good and so is a roadside dhaba.The dosa has endless possibilities. When food celebrity and Masterchef Australia host Matt Preston was in Bangalore recently,Chef Manu Chandra of Olive Beach served him a 12-course tasting menu. It included a funky dish inspired by the masala dosa: super-thin,chutney-smeared pancakes rolled into tight cigarettes and served with drumstick-seed veloute and potato foam.The masala dosa was born in the kitchens of Udupi in coastal Karnataka,claims Subramanya Holla,who runs the three-outlet Udupi Sri Krishna Bhavan chain in Bangalore. The masala dosa is the chains bestseller and sells in the thousands daily. Holla points to the differences between the Mysore masala dosa and the Madras masala dosa,only obvious to the discerning. The Mysore version is thicker yet crispier,more orange-brown than yellow,and is typically served with green coconut chutney,says Holla. He swears that Bangalore is the true home of the classic version. If you close your eyes and picture the masala dosa,it will be a Bangalore special, he says. South Indian dosa aficionados will eat masala dosa only with chutney on the side,just as they will eat the idli only with the sweet-spicy sambar,never the other way round.Hollas Balepet outlet makes it to Bangalores must-eat masala dosa places. Also included in that list are the venerable Vidyarthi Bhavan in Basavanagudi and CTR in Malleswaram,as well as the more recent Janardhan in Kumara Park. All are no-frills hangouts where the masala dosa costs under Rs 50 . But just as every city has its own spin on the masala dosa,each Bangalore neighbourhood has its share of popular dosa outlets with their own legions of fans.Dosa purists may shudder but change is coming fast. Love Sex Aur Dosa members say they are game to try anything that comes in the shape of a dosa. They will not get technical or puritanical. Neighbourhood outlets roll out dozens of variations. Koramangalas 99dosa,for instance,has paneer,mushroom and chocolate variations. Jayanagars Dosa Plaza offers 104 variations including Schezwan,Mexi-roll and American Delight. An outlet called Rajbhog in Malleswaram claims the title of the countrys most expensive dosa with its Rs 1,011 concoction cooked in olive oil and covered in thin gold foil.Having eaten dosa everywhere in India and overseas,Bangalore businessman Niren Mehta considers himself a connoisseur of sorts. He delights in sniffing out the citys best offerings,whether in air-conditioned eateries or roadside carts that open for business only past midnight. He is convinced that the pilgrimage for the perfect masala dosa ends in Bangalore. This is the real thing, he says.saritha.rai@expressindia.comFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Parrikar, who is also minister for agriculture, proposed horticulture hubs in the state.Around one hectare of land would be given for cultivation which he said will also provide employment. Referring to a point raised by opposition leader Pratapsing Rane, the chief minister said that the government will promote contract farming. He said agriculture will get the necessary boost but no Chinese-manufactured machinery will be bought.He also stated that the rates of five vegetables including onions, potatoes and tomatoes will be controlled at the outlets of the horticulture corporation.The cut-off rate will be declared soon, he said, adding that even if the market rate goes up, the rate at the outlets will be maintained. On the issue of stray cattle, Parrikar said that a special cell would be formed to tackle the stray animal menace."

The loss of horticultural crops has been estimated at Rs. 2,332.50 crore on account of 38 per cent deficient rainfall.Horticultural crops account for 41 per cent of the total agricultural income while its share to the State GDP is 7.35 per cent (Rs. 25,000 crore).Dry spellOfficials in the State Secretariat told The Hindu that due to prolonged dry spell in June and July, plantation of horticultural crops declined. The acreage under onion was just 5 per cent of the estimated area for sowing (99,506 hectares). The onion crop was sown on 4,928 hectares against last years coverage of 17,984 hectares.During the normal monsoon, the State has the potential to produce 27.21 lakh tonnes of onion, according to official sources.Chilli covered only seven per cent (2,731 hectares) of the normal grown area (41,096 hectares). The crop is grown in almost all districts. Tomato crop covered 17 per cent (3,716 hectares) of the estimated grown area of 22,067 hectares. Acreage under potato declined in major crop growing districts of Hassan, Kolar Chickballapur, Belgaum and Bangalore Rural. Area under the crop was 14,192 hectares, constituting only 50 per cent of the normal sown area of 28,225 hectares.Hassan contributes 50 per cent of the total output. In the wake of drought, legislators from Hassan district have urged the government to announce a special package for potato growers.Deficient rainfall has severely affected seasonal flowers such as marigold, aster, chrysanthemum and fruit crops  grapes, pomegranate, lime, orange and banana. Prices of banana touched Rs. 60 a kg due to shortfall in supply, a trader said.Officials noted that deficient rain resulted in reduced sowing/planting and the prolonged dry spell has resulted in drying of germinated crop. The loss estimated due to deficit sowing/planting has been estimated at Rs. 413 crore while loss due to yield loss/drying of seasonal crops has been put at Rs. 4.5 crore. Yield loss in perennial crops and drying of perennial crops has been estimated at Rs. 1,240 crore and Rs. 675 crore respectively.The government has urged the Centre to enhance the National Horticultural Mission funds from Rs. 140 crore to Rs. 300 crore in 2012-13 and increase micro-irrigation scheme funds from Rs. 105 crore to Rs. 300 crore."

The price of onion, a must-have in most cuisines, has shot up by Rs. 10 a kilo in a month, selling in retail at an eye-watering Rs. 34 a kg.The poor mans condiment, which was being sold at just Rs. 20 to Rs. 22 a kg a month ago in Bangalore, is now hovering at Rs. 32 to Rs. 34, according to Nagaraj, a grocer on Ullal Main Road.Mr. Nagaraj said when he sourced his stock from the wholesale market last week, it was Rs. 28 a kg, compared to Rs. 16 a month ago.This increase in price has affected individual households and hotel owners as well since onion is an integral part of daily food.Raghavendra Karanth, who runs a hotel, said he has had to cut back on the use of onions in the dishes to ride the price rise. There is also talk of hotel owners preparing to increase prices. Shakuntala Shetty, a homemaker in Jayanagar 5th Block, said that her family requires at least five kg onion a month as she uses the aromatic bulb for every other dish.Its difficult to prepare food without onion and now I am making up using tomato and capsicum.Onion merchants, however, expect the price should come down in the coming days.S. Balakrishna, vice-president, Bangalore Potato and Onion Merchants Association, told The Hindu the wholesale price of fine quality onion in Bangalore market has dropped by about Rs. 2 over the weekend (from Rs. 24 to Rs. 22 a kg). Its effect should be visible in the retail market in about three days since retailers have to sell their existing stock.He, however, ruled out a repeat of 2008-09 when the price of onion touched a vertiginous Rs. 80 to Rs. 85 a kg. With the new crop in north Karnataka almost ready for harvest and produce from Maharashtra arriving in good quantity, the price is set to decrease, Mr. Balakrishna said.The demand for a ban on onion export too could exert pressure in price reduction in the local market, he felt.The Bangalore Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee receives an average of 10,000 quintals of onion every working day. But at least half the produce gets distributed to neighbouring districts and States."

Pushed to the brink by crop failure, poor returns and debt, they have come to the capital in large numbers to add muscle to Ramdev's war on graft. They are not small bands of disaffected farmers but belong to pan-India groups such as Bharat Kisan Union (BKU), Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, Tamil Nadu Farmers' Association, Kheti Virasat Mission, Shetkari Sangathan and others.At Ramlila Maidan on Friday, they expressed their angst over their plight and pledged to turn up in lakhs if needed to make the government listen to them. ""An event of this kind in the capital gives the farming community the chance to ask for their dues. If I start talking about our issues, it will take an entire day. Right now, farmers need financial relief from this year's drought. Wheat, potato and most other crops are failing. We also need a minimum wages programme for farmers as more and more of us are falling under debt,"" said Naresh Singh Tikait, president of BKU, and son of prominent farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait.National coordinator of BKU, Yudhvir Singh, said: ""We should have a Farmer's Income Commission. If our agricultural policies mimic the US and European policies, then the status of the farmer should also be raised accordingly,"" he said.Rajkumar Baliya, a farmer leader from Muzaffarnagar, said if the farmers get fair prices for their crops, it will reduce their worries to a great extent.Chella Muttu, heading Tamil Nadu Farmers' Association, lamented, ""The southern monsoon has completely failed. There is no Cauvery water for paddy. We need drought relief immediately. Now, only 10 of us have come; but if required, we can come in lakhs.""Some other leaders claimed that even while the minimum support price for their produce was low, what they received was almost 25% lesser than that. They also claimed land acquisition has become a major problem along with a drop in the number of people giving up agriculture.Farmer groups and Ramdev's team endorsed the idea of a farmer's income commission, abolition of the Land Acquisition Act in its present form, promotion of bio-fertilizers and organic agriculture, and a stop on FDI in retail.Later, Ramdev was gifted a plough and a farmer's turban by the groups."

For weeks it was selling at Rs 18, and we thought this was as expensive as this basic root can get. Onions have also become costlier by Rs 2-4 to reach Rs 14 per kg this past week. Tomato is already pinching the pocket at Rs 28-30 per kg. How is the common man expected to cook a basic meal,"" asks Tardeo resident Shreeja Mazumdar whose double-income household is also forced to tighten its belt.Trader Sudhir Sanas of Om Sai Enterprises says around 155-170 trucks carrying potato arrive at the APMC market in Vashi daily. ""Over the past few days we have been only receiving around 130 trucks leading to a shortfall in supply. Onions are also selling for Rs 10 in the wholesale market, and naturally retailers mark up their margin by three to four rupees per kg,"" he says.Vasant Zunghare of Rakhi Traders points out that costs go up because both wholesalers and retailers lose some amount of produce in transportation due to spoilage in the monsoon. He says, ""Potato is grown mainly in regions of Uttar Pradesh. The lack of rainfall this season has caused the crop in these places to fail, leading to slow arrivals. Moreover, our trucks cover an average of 1,300 km from UP to Mumbai. At least 15 kg of every 50 kg goes to waste because the root becomes soggy due to rain. Traders mark up prices to cover this loss as well.""On Saturday, however, prices of potato dipped just a little in the wholesale market, sending a signal that some relief might be around the corner. ""Still, by and large, potato will continue to remain costly over the next five to six months until the new crop is safely through,"" says Zunghare.The one bulb that has brought some solace is garlic. ""Last year, the crop failed across Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and retail prices shot up to Rs 250-350 per kg, up from Rs 50-60. As a result, farmers sowed more than the required quantity. This year, the resultant harvest has caused rates to fall to an unprecedented Rs 10-20 per kg in the wholesale market, and Rs 40-50 in the retail bazar,"" says Sanas.Ashok Walunj, the director of the onion-potato market at Vashi's APMC, says, ""Potato is not an essential item so whether it touches Rs 22 or Rs 30 per kg makes no difference to the consumer. The housewife will find a range of vegetables, like cabbage and cauliflower, to choose from. Onion, on the other hand, you cannot do without. This year, the rains are late by two months so the onion crop has been delayed. Later this year, you will pay Rs 25-30 for onions."""
256,Inflation eases to 6.87 % in July,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/inflation-eases-to-687-in-july/article3773551.ece,2012-08-15,The Hindu,"Headline inflation eased by a larger-than-expected margin to 6.87 per cent in July from 7.25 per cent in the previous month but the welcome drop on account of a decline in vegetable prices does not provide enough comfort to prompt the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to tweak its key policy rates.The WPI (wholesale price index) data released here on Tuesday revealed that the overall inflation in July, 2012, though on a marked downtrend as compared to 9.36 per cent in the same month a year ago and at its lowest since November, 2009, still remains way above the RBIs comfort zone of 5-6 per cent mainly owing to prices of vegetables continuing to rule at elevated levels. As per the data, the price spiral in vegetables eased somewhat in July as compared to the previous month as the year-on-year inflation in greens stood pegged at 24 per cent during the month, down from 49 per cent in June. As a consequence, food inflation, which has a share of about 15 per cent in the WPI basket, slipped marginally to 10.06 per cent in July from 10.81 per cent in June this year.On the other hand, the rate of price rise in the manufacturing sector, or core inflation, inched up to 5.58 per cent in July from 5 per cent in June, mainly on account of higher prices of cotton textiles, paper and paper products, cement and lime.While food inflation in double digits has continued to remain a concern for both the government and the RBI, the rising trend in core inflation is expected to further dampen the prospects of any interest rate cut by the apex bank even in the wake of a discernible slowdown in the economy.Just a day ago, RBI Governor D. Subbarao had stated in Hyderabad that price pressures needed to be contained as headline inflation above 7 per cent was above the tolerance level.The RBI is scheduled to undertake its mid-quarter monetary policy review on September 17.Agreeing with Dr. Subbaraos views, Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, while commenting on the July numbers, said: The dip is welcome but inflation is still above the comfort level. Five-to-six per cent is tolerable level of inflation.Apart from the effect of a high base kicking in, the decline in inflation in July, according to analysts, is likely to be the last dip during the current calendar year, especially when the country is faced with the prospect of a drought-like situation, which is expected to add to the already prevailing supply constraints in the coming months. Despite the marginal decline in food inflation during the month, potatoes turned dearer by 73 per cent, rice by 10.12 per cent and cereals by 8.29 per centon a year-on-year basis."

Gangadharan, a paddy farmer in Palakkad, says that those who bought fertilizers for the first crop have not received any money so far though he feels that the new system will be of help in the long run.K. Krishnamurty, paddy farmer, fears that subsidies will come late this year. The new system is proving cumbersome for farmers and the mandatory registration of farmers, despite several deadlines, is not complete yet, he says.K. R. Jyotilal, Secretary, Agriculture, says that the new system is being streamlined though there are a few technical hitches. One of the problems, he says, is the treasury-bank link, which is being looked into. Otherwise the system is working perfectly, he says pointing out that farmers pension under Swabhiman scheme is being disbursed through the new system.Mr. Jyotilal says there are some vested interests spreading canards about the regime.Paddy cultivationPaddy cultivation has been the hardest hit by poor rains as exemplified by Palakkad, where yield is likely to be down by about 40 per cent. Besides, the harvest will be delayed because of the dry conditions. In Alappuzha, both Pokkali areas and Kuttanad have been hit by the monsoon shortfall.About 150 hectares of Purakkad Karinilam lies fallow for the ongoing Virippu season because of excess soil acidity, which traditionally used to be treated with rain water. Around 250 hectares of Pokkali fields are remaining fallow for want of rain. Forty hectares of Pokkali, which came under sowing, does not promise normal yield, according to sources in the Agriculture Department.A total of 12,000 hectares have come under the Virippu crop this season though the crop is at various stages between 30 and 60 days. Sources point out that the lack of rain threatened to hit the upcoming Puncha season, during which larger areas come under paddy in the district.VegetablesCool season vegetable production in the high ranges of Idukki district is down about 50 per cent because of unseasonal rain. Rains in May caused potato seed stocks waste and poor rains in early June created a drought-like situation in Vattavada and Kanthalloor areas.V.V. Pushpangadhan, chief executive officer of Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam, says that the present estimate is that potato production in the two areas will be down about 50 per cent this season.Production of other cool season vegetables like beans, carrot and cabbage as well as garlic has been hit by lack of rains in the high ranges this year.FertilizersDespite poor offtake this season, fertilizer prices continue to move up. Price of the popular fertilizer mixture Factamfos is hovering around Rs.19,000 a tonne this season compared to Rs.14,000 last year.

""Food is an integral part of the celebration; we need to have it in the morning, before or after the prayer. Usually, it's sewaiyan, kachoris, or milk with dates cooked in it,"" says Junaid Ali Khan, a marketing executive.The food for the rest of the day, however, is more elaborate. There's keema stew and biryani along with other sumptuous dishes, in quantities enough to feed their extended family members, who visit them during the day. ""Mutton plays a big role; even vegetables or potatoes have minced meat in them,"" he says.Rising prices have forced many families to stay within their budget and focus on a simpler menu, but for many non-Muslims it's still a meal fit for a king. ""I absolutely love dishes like korma, and when they're homemade, they're more authentic. Though I don't celebrate Eid, I wait for it every year just for the food,"" says Sahil Arora, whose colleague sends him home-cooked food on Eid.While rich food, family bonding and prayer form the common thread running through the festival, every family has its own way of celebrating the day. Tanzila Anis, a freelance copywriter, says, ""A Salman Khan movie has been releasing every year during Eid, so it's become a tradition for us to go for one in the evening.""For Amna Mirza Sayeed, a political science lecturer in Delhi University, celebrations this year were different, as this was her first Eid after marriage.""I had to wear a heavy brocade suit, and supervise everything at home. There was also more responsibility as I had to play host to so many different people, and ensure the preparations were done well. Last year I was pretty carefree,"" says Sayeed. While she bonded with friends and family during the day, in the evening she took sewaiyan, sweets and fruit for kids at an orphanage near India Gate. This year's Eid took on a new meaning for her as she also celebrated a new phase in her life.No festival is complete without gifts, and on Eid, too, it's customary for elders to give gifts to youngsters. At just 11 years, Salim is too young to observe the monthlong period of fasting, but he still looks forward to his Eidi (gifts). ""I got a remote-controlled helicopter from my parents this year,"" he sayshappily. Last year, it was just a token amount of Rs 100, so the excitement is understandable.Abstinence during Ramzan isn't limited to food and water. Those who observe it are encouraged to practise self-restraint. And for many people, it's the little things they've refrained from that matter a lot. ""It's great to finally gossip with friends on Eid!"" says Khan."

The prices of dals and other cereals have gone up.In last three days, the prices of tomato, potato, ladyfinger, brinjal have increased. Tomato, which was being sold for Rs 30 per kg a few days back, is now available for Rs 40 a kg. The prices of bittermelon have nearly doubled. It is being sold for Rs 55-60 a kg. Earlier, bittermelon was available for Rs 30-40 a kg. Prices of other vegetables have also shot up by atleast one-and-a-half times. The price of potato has also gone up.

Parwal is being sold for Rs 40 a kg in the retail market.Cauliflower, which is being pumped into vegetable markets from cold storage, is being sold for Rs 20 to 40.In markets of south Kanpur, potato which was available for Rs 14 a kg, is now being sold for Rs 20 a kg. This has burnt a bigger hole in the pocket of the denizens, who are finding it tough to manage the kitchen expenses.Blackmarketing and hoarding of vegetables in cold storages are the other reasons. This is not giving the farmers a chance to earn. Touts and cold storage owners are busy in minting money. Heavy rainfall has been damaging the crop. The trucks that come to wholesale 'mandis' in the city are also unloading less quantity of vegetable. In Govind Nagar, Kidwai Nagar and Shastri Nagar vegetable markets, tomato is being sold between Rs 50-60 a kg. In the vegetables markets of posh areas like Swaroop Nagar, the cost of vegetables is much higher. 'Shimla mirch' is being sold at Rs 100 a kg.The prices of ginger and 'dhaniya' have also gone up.The prices of various dals are nearly 5% more now in comparison to recent past. The prices of refined oil and castor oil have multiplied. Arhar dal, which was available for Rs 55 a kg a month back, is now being sold between Rs 61 and 65 a kg. The price of 'moong dal' is Rs 65 a kg these days. In June, it was being sold for Rs 50 a kg. Refined oil is being sold for Rs 92 a litre. It was sold last month for Rs 80 a litre. The price of cooking oil is more than Rs 100 a litre. At some markets, people are forced to buy cooking oil for Rs 110 a litre.The difference in prices of food items in wholesale and retail markets has further hit the common people. The wholesalers and retailers blame higher fuel cost to be reason for increase in the cost of the food items. .Gyanesh Mishra, general secretary, Akhil Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal said that blackmarketing and hoarding of the food items has led to further increase in the prices. Short supply has further aggravated the problem."

Many find it an additional burden to their monthly budget. S Krishnan, a retired government employee who lives in Peelamedu says that the rates of vegetables have skyrocketed. ""I generally buy vegetables every other day. I have to carry at least Rs 500 to ensure that I can buy everything I need to,"" he says.Many residents express similar sentiments. But traders say this is a common trend during the Onam season and prices will come down again after the festival. PV Badruddin, a resale trader at the TK Market near Town Hall says that this is a yearly occurrence. ""During the Onam season, veggies become dearer. This is because of the increased demand from Kerala,"" he says.They say that vegetables come to the city from Gobichettipalayam, Kinathukadavu, Chemmedu and neighbouring states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. N Muhamad Mubarak, a wholesale trader at Saibaba Colony says that business is flourishing. ""Hundreds of trucks carry vegetables to Kerala,"" he says.At the same time, the prices of some vegetables have decreased. For instance cabbage, potatoes and beans have become less expensive due to increase in supply to the local markets, says Badruddin.Onam is a 10-day celebration from August 21 to 29. Traders say that rates will continue to be high till the Onam season ends. Rates will come down soon after, unless the rains are inadequate, says Mubarak.The wholesale rates will come down after the Onam season says N Muhamam Mubarak, the owner of MS Traders near Saibaba Colony. He says that a week after Onam, business will be quite dull. ""The markets will be almost empty,"" he says."

Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, RBI, at a conference on Systemic Risk, organised by the Great Lakes Institute of Management in Chennai on Monday. Photo: Bijoy GhoshWork within the rules laid down by the regulator. If you cant, you better find a different avenue where you can do your business, says K. C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor of Reserve Bank of India.He was reacting to a question on the suggestion made by State Bank of India Chairman Pratip K. Chaudhuri to abolish CRR (cash reserve ratio). .From State Bank point of view, they can ask for abolition of CRR, SLR (statutory liquidity ratio). But, we have to function within the regulatory system in which you are in. If you are not able to do business in the regulatory system in which you are functioning you will have to find out something else  where you can do business, Dr. Chakrabarty said in an interaction with The Hindu here on Monday.Quizzed further, he said, No, I am not angry [with SBI chairman]. In this context, he cited the example of bargaining with a vendor of potatoes in the marketplace. While the vendor quoted Rs.10 a kg, the buyer quoted Rs.3 a kg. But the fellow [seller] does not agree. So, the deal does not take place.The RBI Deputy Governor asked: What is the regulatory system for? Whether to reduce it [CRR] to zero or increase it, the regulator had the right to decide.Asked if the Reserve Bank would seek the opinion of banks on this issue, he said, Why should I take others opinion. My regulatory system is not based on what the opinion of other people is. When pointed out that many countries did not have CRR, he said, several countries are not having. But several others are having.It is the job of Reserve Bank to decide. Anybody who has to do the business has to do it within the regulatory environment which has been provided.The SBI Chairman sought the abolition of CRR on the ground that it did not earn any interest for the banks.That is what CRR is meant for, Dr. Chakrabarty said, pointing out that is also what the law says. The RBI, he explained, had no role to play in this. The Banking Regulation Act says you cannot pay interest on the CRR. The matter is over. If law says certain things, it is like that.If you feel [that RBI decision is an irritant], then pay little bit less interest rate on deposit or charge more interest on loans. How much difference does it make? Regulatory things are your production cost. So, you have to accordingly adjust your pricing, he added."

It is now priced at Rs 60 per kg.While these are retail prices fixed by vendors in the Sector 26 vegetable market, vegetables sold by regular vendors in the city are more expensive.Deepak, a vendor from the Sector 26 market, said, Due to Navratri, there has been an increase in the prices of potato and sweet potato. Moreover, the irregular supply of vegetables led to the hike in prices.Some vendors are monopolising the supply of vegetables.On Saturday, a vendor in the vegetable market in Phase 4, SAS Nagar, was selling sweet potatoes for Rs 100 per kg as he was the only one who had the entire stock in the whole market. The prices of other items consumed during the festive season, including wheatbuck flour, fasting potato chips, have also witnessed an increase.One kg of wheatbuck flour (kuttu aata) is available at Rs 95, which is otherwise priced at Rs 60 per kg on regular days.

Our role is advisory.""He said IPL was interested in exporting both organic and inorganic types of potatoes and that BAU would assist the farmers to increase their production.The representatives of IPL were escorted by R K Sohane, director (extension), BAU, to Nalanda to meet the farmers and start the deliberations for the deal. Sohane said, ""The farmers here produce mainly 'Kufri Pokhraj' variety but the exporters demanded varieties like 'Kufri Surya', 'Kufri Jyoti' etc. The IPL officials have offered to either fix the cost of potatoes depending on its value for the last three years before the cultivation or after, whichever suits the farmers."""

Many farmers have switched to other forms of livelihood.Under the circumstances the constantly rising prices of fertilizers have subjected the farming community here to considerable hardship.Alleging that hoarding by manufacturers and dealers was one of the reasons for the shortage of fertilizers and consequent rise in prices, he urged the government to intervene and take steps on a war footing to bring down the prices."

Analysts said it is expected to keep the price pressure on essential commodities up in the months ahead.The diesel hike and the LPG dual pricing policy will kick in next month. The September index is thus likely to breach 8 per cent, since the primary effect of the diesel hike will be at least 0.6 per cent. As the price hike spreads through the economy, the spread effect will be more than 1 per cent, economists said.Official data said, a sharp increase in food items like pulses, wheat, potato and some other vegetables helped fan inflation in August.The overall food inflation is headed for double-digits, as it now hovers around 9.14 percent. Barring vegetable, milk, onion and fruit, all others remained is in double-digits, with pulses and potato rising by 34 per cent and 69 per cent in August.The government also revised upward June inflation figures. The WPI inflation for June is revised upward at 7.58 per cent from 7.25 per cent.Reacting to Fridays inflation numbers, Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, said, Inflation is a consequence of macroeconomic imbalances."

PeriasamyThe message from the wholesale and retail vegetable traders in the city is clear  expect a 10 to 15 per cent increase in vegetable prices soon. The traders also say that the impact will be more pronounced in big onion for other reasons as well.Coimbatore, on an average, gets around 1,000 to 1,300 tonnes vegetables a day from neighbouring districts, Salem, Krishnagiri, southern Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, northern Karnataka and Maharashtra as well. Fifty per cent of the vegetables go to Kerala, and the city and its surrounding areas consume the rest.It also gets a few vegetables from places within the district. But the impact of diesel price hike is likely to be negligible because of the relatively shorter distance.The city gets a majority of the English vegetables like carrot, beans, cabbage, etc. from southern Karnataka, particularly Chamaraja Nagar and Hassan. It gets chilli from areas around Hassan and also Andhra Pradesh. Given the distance and the Rs. 5-a-litre increase, there is bound to be an increase, says A. Subramani, secretary, Kovai Mavatta Anna Motha Kaikari Vyaparigal Sangam, MGR Market.The traders or sellers despatch the vegetables in small or big lorries based on the order. The small or mini lorries transport up to 15 tonnes and the big ones up to 20 tonnes. For the small lorries the transport cost is likely to increase by at least Rs. 5,000 to around Rs. 40,000. And for the big ones by the same amount to around Rs. 50,000, he says.The city is dependent on Karnataka for the vegetables because the vegetable supply from Ooty is way below the demand. And another reason is that over the years, the cultivation area has declined there and so has the produce, says M. Rajendra, a vegetable vendor at T.K. Market.Notwithstanding any other factor, the diesel price rise alone will increase the transport cost by at least 10 per cent, says S.F. Abdul Althaf, president, Kovai Mavatta Anna Motha Kaikari Vyaparigal Sangam, MGR Market. This will push up the wholesale price and consequently, vegetable prices.But the biggest impact will be on big onion as the sowing area in Karnataka and Maharashtra has come down because of poor monsoon, says C.N. Palanisamy, president of a wholesale traders association. At present, the price is around Rs. 10-a-kg. It will increase 100 per cent by Deepavali and go up further as the demand increases.This will have a cascading effect on small onion as well.Mr. Palanisamy says that there will be a similar impact on potato as well because the cultivation is again in the North and areas there have suffered not-so-good monsoon."

According to sources in Malgodown, the state's largest wholesale essential commodities market, prices of essential commodities are slated to soar by 10% to 20%.""As the freight charges will go up, subsequently the cost of essential commodities like rice, pulses, edible oil and sugar will also shoot up by 10-20%.

""Odisha is a deficit state and we depend on other states for essential commodities like edible oil, sugar, pulses and vegetables. So the hike in diesel price will obviously burn a hole in the pocket of the common man here,"" Sahoo said. ""Odisha imports sugar from states such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Pulses are procured from Maharastra and potato is imported from West Bengal. Hence the hike in freight rates will worsen the situation for the people of Odisha,"" he said.""With the hike in diesel price, we will now have to pay Re 1 extra per kilometre towards freight charges. So subsequently the prices of each sack of rice will rise by 10%. Our economics will change and we have no option but to push it on to the common man,"" said Madhusudan Rout, president of Odisha Rice Merchants' Association.According to traders, the common man will feel the price pinch from next week.

When the weight was checked, the sealed packet was found to weigh a mere 8g instead of the 30g mentioned on the packet - 72% less.Bajaj brought this to the notice of the Consumer Education and Research Society (CERS) which filed a case against PepsiCo at the consumer disputes redressal forum. In a judgment issued recently, the forum ordered PepsiCo India Holdings Ltd to deposit Rs 50,000 in the Consumer Welfare Fund of India within 90 days of receipt of the order. PepsiCo was also asked to pay Bajaj Rs 5,000 for mental agony and Rs 2,000 towards the cost of litigation.Before approaching the forum, Bajaj twice wrote to the manufacturer. The first letter got no response, in reply to the second, the company accepted that the packet was underweight but didn't take the complaint seriously. It offered Bajaj a gift-hamper from PepsiCo which he refused.Contrary to the commonly-held belief that well-known, leading brands live up to their name and refrain from duping consumers, Consumer Education & Research Society (CERS), Ahmedabad, has brought to light one case where the Indian subsidiary of international food & beverages giant PepsiCo was found selling under-weight packets of its popular potato chips brand 'Lay's'.A CERS press release said that while just one packet was randomly discovered to be underweight, a simple calculation indicates that the company can earn an extra profit of around Rs 2.75 lakh, if the entire production of 36,700 packets of the same batch were sold under-weight.""This holds significance since on CERS's query, the company could not totally rule out this possibility. CERS resorted to legal action in its attempt to compel PepsiCo to pay compensation and punitive damages, and uphold consumer rights,"" the release said.The release said that when CERS first wrote to the company their response was denial. ""There is practically no possibility of such a pack coming out of our plant,"" PepsiCo had replied.CERS officials said that Simi Mehta, a PepsiCo spokesperson, admitted on the phone that the company had been getting complaints about underweight packets from its Pune plant. This was, therefore, not an isolated incident.CERS had good reasons to believe that the sale of underweight packets to consumers was not a freak accident. This could happen with their various products in several batches from different PepsiCo plants. Even if such an instance/technical glitch occurs at PepsiCo on a given day, it has huge implications for the company and its consumers.Eventually, CERS took the issue to the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad (rural), alleging unfair trade practices.

The one week in the year when you can afford to eat at fine dining hot spots without it hurting your wallet too much is around the corner.Restaurant Week Bangalore, from September 24 to September 30, part of the pan-India culinary event, Restaurant Week India (RWI), will see 17 of the city's finest eateries come together to present a bespoke dining experience at a fraction of the cost that one would have otherwise spent. This is the first year wherein the event is being held on a large scale in Namma Bengaluru, after having done a pilot run last year around the same time.Participating restaurants in the city will offer a threecourse prix fixe (set) menu during lunch and dinner with an option of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes at a price of Rs 750 per head. This price, excludes taxes, service and items ordered outside the prix fixe menu. The prices in Mumbai and Delhi are Rs 1,000 plus taxes per head (for lunch) and Rs 1,200 plus taxes per head (for dinner). According to 30-year old Chef Nachiket Shetye, partner at 36 Oak & Barley restaurant, Mumbai, and co-founder of RWI, ""Pricing across restaurants in Bangalore is very competitive as compared prices of restaurants in Mumbai and Delhi. One can get to eat at any of the big restaurants in the city starting from Rs 1,200 per head. Hence, we needed to price it below that benchmark price.""Shetye and Mangal Dalal,29, co-founder RWI spent a week in the city sampling around two to three restaurants during lunch and dinner each day, before finalizing on the list of participating restaurants.""The chefs present us their signature dishes, we try them and if we like them we go ahead and include that restaurant. A lot of restaurants want to participate and get in touch with us, but we don't take all on board for the heck of it. We only choose those who's pricing, food and brand matches our selection criteria,"" explains Shetye.The 17-participating restaurants (listed in the table), will cumulatively have on offer close to 700 tables, which translates to around 2,400 covers (a cover being one seat), during the week long event. Last year RWI did 6,500 covers, and this time the event aims is to touch 10,000 covers across Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore. While Mumbai has 29 participating restaurants, Delhi has 24.""As a student in New York, Restaurant Week New York was the week to look forward too as you get the chance to dine at the best restaurants in the city at a price, which then was as low as $10 per head,"" recollects Manu Chandra , executive chef, Olive Beach and co-owner Monkey Bar and Likethatonly. According to Chandra, the concept of Restaurant Week India has had an impact among diners in Mumbai and Delhi, as participating restaurants do see a fare amount of new customers going back to dine at the restaurants post the event.Reservations for Restaurant Week Bangalore can only be made online through RWI's website www.restau rantweekindia.com starting September 16, 2012. It is to be noted that table reservations are restricted only to two, three and four, and people are discouraged from booking at the same restaurant more than once, in order to try out all the participating restaurants.""For us (restaurants) this is an excellent opportunity to reach out to customers, as it gives us an opportunity to create a special menu and offer it at a special price. When an event like this happens there is a lot of buzz, activity, and a lot of attention that it garners and hence restaurants are able to get a lot more footfalls from beyond regular customers,"" says chef Abhijit Saha of Avant Garde Hospitality, which runs fine dining restaurants Caperberry and Fava. Corroborating the point Virender Razdan, GM, ITC Windsor, says, ""Our participation in Restaurant Week Bangalore will definitely help us reach out to newer audiences in city."" To be held simultaneously in Mumbai and Delhi, the concept of RWI has been inspired by the internationally acclaimed concept Restaurant Week New York, which celebrates its 20th edition this year. Restaurant Week India took off with Restaurant Week Mumbai in September 2010 and since then the event is held twice a year in Mumbai and Delhi. Next year Bangalore too will play host to the event twice.""Restaurant Week is a concept we have borrowed from events that have happened across the globe. It started in 1992 in New York, and then spread across South America , Europe, and in Asia, Singapore was the first to do a Restaurant Week in 2010,"" Shetye. Elaborating on the concept, he says, ""RWI offers people the opportunity to dine at the city's most aspirational restaurants at more affordable prices."" Dalal adds, ""More importantly, it is a week-long celebration of the culinary scene in each city - a time for us to be proud of our finest restaurants.""Baluchi,The Lalit Ashok Bene,Sheraton Benjarong,Ulsoor Road Blue Ginger,The Taj West End Cafe Noir,UB City Caperberry,Dickenson Road Dakshin,ITC Windsor Dum Pukht,ITC Windsor Fava,UB City Graze, Taj Vivanta, MG Road Likethatonly,Whitefield Mynt,The Taj West End Olive Beach,Ashok Nagar The Pink Poppadom,Hotel Ista Shiro,UB City Sunny's ,Vittal Mallya Road Teppan,Ulsoor RoadSoy Glazed Pork Ribs (Braised & finished with Grape & Soy Glaze) - LIKETHATONLY Interpretation of Meen Moilee (turmeric grilled red snapper, tamrind rice, tomato chutney, savoury coconut milk panna cotta)- CAPERBERRY Kacche koyale ka khargosh (Char grilled rabbit Baluch style)- BALUCHI Crabmeat and Guacamole mix salad served with roasted slice of breads and homemade fried potato chips - CAFE NOIR Prawn with kaffir lime (Prawn stir fried with lemongrass, galangal, fresh red chilies and kaffir leaves) - SHIRO Coorg Chicken and Kasundi Fish with Ghee Bhath - THE PINK POPPADOM"

People who had been dilly-dallying with plans to put their vehicles up for sale and embrace walking for short-distance travel and rely on public transport for long distances, have finally made up their minds. They are now firm on implementing the long-pending decision thanks to a steep hike in diesel price announced recently.For all those who thought that hopping on a bus operated by the AP State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) would be the safest bet, heres the bad news. The RTC higher-ups are busy doing their arithmetic to effect a bus fare hike very soon. Most of their energies are spent in trying to do a balancing act to ensure that neither the Corporation nor the commuter is over-burdened.A bus fare hike is inevitable in these circumstances. The RTC higher-ups are studying all pros and cons to work on a viable proposal which will be forwarded for the Centres approval, K. Gopinatha Reddy, Regional Manager of the Corporation in Krishna region, told The Hindu on Sunday.Referring to the APSRTC Managing Director A.K. Khans statement that the hike had imposed an additional burden of Rs.350 crore on the Corporation, Mr. Reddy said in Krishna region, the RTC would suffer a revenue loss of Rs.6 lakh per day.We were desperate to improve the occupancy ratio and enhance the revenue even before the recent hike. The fresh move is a hard blow to the Corporation, he said.He said that in Krishna region, the RTC had managed to strike a balance as it neither garnered profits nor incurred losses. But the hike will disturb the equilibrium, he rued.Meanwhile, an additional Garuda Plus bus to Coimbatore has been inducted into the RTC fleet. This is in addition to another bus service to Jagdalpur in Chattisgarh besides plans to induct two new Indra buses which would travel towards Visakhapatnam.We have also introduced one service from Gudivada to Raichur and have plans to introduce one more bus from Vijayawada to Bhadrachalam, he said.We were desperate to improve the occupancy ratio and enhance the revenue: MDAn additional Garuda Plus bus to Coimbatore has been inducted into the RTC fleet"
275,Diesel rollback an option,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120917/jsp/business/story_15985373.jsp,2012-09-17,Telegraph,"Whiff of hope New Delhi, Sept. 16: The Congress-led government has made up its mind on not buckling under Mamata Banerjees pressure to roll back FDI in aviation or multi-brand retail. However, top finance ministry officials said the government might look at the possibility of rolling back the Rs 5-a-litre hike in diesel prices announced on Thursday by 50 paise to Re 1. A pointer to the possibility of a partial rollback is the little noticed demand made by Keralas Congress chief minister Oomen Chandy. But it can come as a face-saver for the Trinamul Congress as it can claim that the partial rollback is a result of its protests. On FDI in retail, Trinamul will maintain that it protected Bengals grocers by not approving the reform. The original cabinet note prepared by the petroleum ministry had recommended two scenarios of price increase  a hike of Rs 4 and an increase of Rs 5 along with the corresponding subsidy burden. A 50-paise rollback will involve a loss of Rs 2,100 crore for the rest of the year, while a Re 1 rollback will cost the government Rs 4,200 crore. However, officials made it clear that the decision on FDI in retail was not negotiable. The move to allow foreign retailers such as Walmart, Carrefour and Tesco to pick up to a 51 per cent stake in large format stores comes nine months after an earlier decision was put on hold. A second back-tracking could lead to a crisis of confidence in the India story and make foreign and Indian investors extremely jittery, officials pointed out. Officials also expect some of the larger agrarian states and parties with strong farmer support to come out in support of FDI. Studies have shown that direct purchase of farm produce by retail chains can help consumers save 5-20 per cent, while increasing the price recovery of farmers by about the same percentage. The Congress government is also hoping that Mamata will drop her hardline stance over time. Bengal is one of the biggest agricultural states. It is the largest producer of rice, vegetables, fish and pineapples and the second-largest producer of potatoes in India and accounts for about 10 per cent of the edible oil produced in the country. However, potatoes often sell as low as Rs 2 a kg in the farm markets in the state, while at the retail level they are sold at over Rs 20 a kg in most metro cities and at Rs 10 a kg in Calcutta. Farmers in Bengal as in other parts of the country can benefit from their huge surpluses if middlemen are eliminated from the supply chain and retailers buy directly. Commerce ministry officials hope that states such as Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh will be forced to change tack on foreign retailers once they see the direct benefit to their large farmer communities. The FDI in retail decision makes it mandatory for all foreign-controlled retailers to spend 50 per cent of their investment in building backroom infrastructure in rural areas such as cold storage and processing plants. This should act as an additional incentive for acceptance by the agrarian states."
276,Big mart dream spurs debate,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120917/jsp/bihar/story_15984385.jsp,2012-09-17,Telegraph,"HOW PRICES CHANGE Patna, Sept. 16: Farmers in Bihar have set their sights on foreign funds for a change in their fortune though economists have cast a doubt on it. Ask Nitish Kumar, a farmer of Darveshpura village in Nalanda district, who hogged the limelight a couple of months ago with record production of potatoes. Nitish had no one by his side when he was forced to go for distress sale of the same potato, which had earned him laurels, at Warsaliganj market in neighbouring Nawada district. I need capital for next round of harvest. I was also saddened to learn when the middleman who purchased my product sold the potatoes at double the price he had paid to me, Nitish told The Telegraph over phone  the jubilance in his voice has turned feeble in some months. Fridays FDI decision had a roller-coaster effect on Nitish, who stays some 100km southeast of Patna in a nondescript village. His hope of better future proved short-lived when he came to know about the Bihar governments stand. Coming of big players would have given us a chance to deal directly with the procurers as such stores buy stuff directly from farmers, he said. His answer lies with his famous namesake. The Nitish Kumar government has been opposing the FDI proposal in its present form, claiming that the new system would replace the existing supply chain in which neither consumers nor farmers would benefit. The governments stand, however, does not appear to be convincing for a group of farmers from Nayanagar village in Samastipur district, around 120 northeast of Patna. A group of litchi farmers from our area is supplying produces directly to firms. It has helped the group in two ways  freeing themselves from the clutches of middlemen and ensuring an assured market for the product, said Sudhanshu Kumar, a member of the group. The state government talks of agriculture roadmap and rainbow revolution but it is not allowing its farmers to avail the opportunity of having easy access to organised market players who deal with farmers transparently, he said. Sugarcane industry minister Awadhesh Kushwaha, who himself has been a progressive farmer, said: We hope the agriculture roadmap, to be released by President Pranab Mukherjee during his visit in October, would take care of all these aspects. But problems are plenty in Bihar. Yashwant Singh, a farmer of Rohtas district, said FDI in retail would help create back-end infrastructure like warehouse and cold storage. Agriculture department sources said the state, at present, has a capacity to store only about 9.5 lakh tonnes of foodgrain against a production of 170 lakh tonnes while it has a preservation capacity of around 13 lakh tonnes of fruits and vegetables in cold storages. On average, the state produces about 40 lakh tonnes of fruits and 140 lakh tonnes of vegetables. Admitting FDI in retail would help Bihar on the storage front, economist N.K. Choudhary said: But one cannot expose the farmers to monopolistic capitalists who would start weeding out small players and exploit farmers in the long run. Can anyone guarantee that the new system will not lead to exploitation of farmers? Choudharys apprehension finds roots in a Bhagalpur farmer, Niraj Sahu. He said banana growers in the region were supplying to one such chain of retail outlet in Jharkhand. But after giving good rate in the first few years, the chain started offering very low price. Some farmers have another question: will they ever be free from the local middlemen? It appears that we are destined to play in the hands of middlemen, said Sanjeev Kumar, a cauliflower grower of Hajipur. Being a farmer, I have every right to think about the interest of the farming community instead of bothering about the interests of others, he said."
277,Ushering in the retail revolution,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/talkingturkey/ushering-in-the-retail-revolution/,2012-09-18,The Times Of India,"Though cheered by industry, the governments decision to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail has raised hackles in several quarters. Political parties (both within and outside the government at the Centre) as well as several state governments have pledged to fight the move tooth and nail. As this goes to print, Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress is meeting to decide its future association with the UPA dispensation. But fears about foreign retail giants like Walmart and Tesco gobbling up small domestic retailers and monopolising the $450 billion Indian retail market are highly exaggerated. Nowhere in the world has this happened and there is no reason to believe that it will happen now in India. In that sense, the opposition to FDI in multi-brand retail is purely political with an eye on cultivating vote banks.In fact, there are several advantages domestic small-scale retailers have that foreign retailers like Walmart simply cant match. If one takes these into consideration, there is no reason to doubt that foreign and domestic retailers can indeed co-exist, compete and create efficient farm-to-fork supply chains. Such co-habitation would benefit both farmers and consumers, with the former realising better rates for their produce and the latter having access to a range of quality products at affordable prices.In the interest of a vibrant retail industry there are a few myths that need to be busted.Myth 1: FDI will squeeze out small retailersNothing could be further from the truth. Small retailers or neighbourhood kirana stores have a distinct advantage over large department stores in that they have a strong bond with their customers. In fact, anyone close to the retail business will tell you that forming such a relationship is half the battle. Retail giants such as Walmart spend millions of dollars trying to forge such a rapport, but their scale and size act as natural impediments. In contrast, the small mom-and-pop stores tend to know each and every customer in their neighbourhood. And it is this familiarity that allows customers to have a running tab with the local kirana shop, have things conveniently delivered home on short notices and haggle over prices. This is something that no Walmart can replicate. People might choose the large foreign retail outlets for their monthly bulk rations or to buy exotic items, but they would still go to the local kirana store for a loaf of bread or a jerrycan of drinking water.Myth 2: Local producers will be hurt as foreign goods will flood the domestic marketThis is the biggest myth of them all. Nothing prevents existing local retailers from importing foreign goods. Yet, we cant really say that we regularly feast on Belgian potatoes or South American chilies. If foreign retailers set up shop here, 90% of their goods will be procured and sold locally. On the other hand, farmers will get access to foreign markets through these retail giants and their vast global networks. And in case we happen to experience a bad agriculture year due to the vagaries of nature, leading to shortages and rising prices, the foreign retailers can use their multi-national reach to readily import essential goods and cool prices.Myth 3: Farmers will be forced to sell to foreign retailers at lower pricesThose who buy this argument grossly underestimate the farmers lobby and kisan politics in India. There are several government policies that favour farmers  subsidised electricity and minimum support prices (MSPs) being some of them. Farmers can either choose to sell their produce such as wheat, maize, paddy, jowar, bajra, etc under the governments price support schemes or sell to a private dealer if they stand to realise better profits. Hence, farmers already have a safety net and will only sell to foreign retailers if they get a better deal. Besides, if companies such as Reliance  who have been in the retail business for sometime now  havent been able to corner the retail market or change basic farm production relations, I dont see how Walmart and Tesco can.But foreign retailers will force everyone to compete and raise their standards. By implementing best practices, investing in cold storage chains and cutting out the middlemen, foreign retailers will help reduce wastage and benefit farmers and consumers alike.Meanwhile, I see local kirana shops evolving into multi-service convenient stores to realise new revenue streams. We can already see this happening with those mom-and-pop shops that sell mobile recharge facilities in addition to general goods. But the best examples can be found in the neighbourhood convenient stores in Taiwan. Such Taiwanese stores not only sell the freshest of produce  thanks to the Taiwanese obsession for freshness  but also offer a variety of services such as booking railway and movie tickets, renewing cable and magazine subscriptions, paying utility bills and even couriering personal goods. This Taiwanese retail model is definitely worth replicating in India.Taken together, the entry of foreign retail giants will kickstart a much-needed retail revolution in the country that will see large department stores and variety mom-and-pop shops compete and co-exist to the benefit of all."

We had stocked the produce at our agricultural fields and at storage facilities in the taluk waiting for a good price. We brought the produce to Yeshwantpur in the City, as we heard that a quintal of onions was being sold at Rs 1,000. Sadly, now the prices have been slashed to Rs 400 in the wake of the Bharat bandh and Gowri-Ganesha festival. The prices will be reduced further by the weekend, as the produce brought to the yard is more, said Gurappa Yaranal, a farmer from Bijapur.M S Khori, a 55-year-old farmer from Kakandaki village in Basavana Bagewadi taluk in Bijapur district, was sitting with 200 bags (each having 50 kg) of onions at the yard.Only a few tonnesI came from Bijapur to the City to sell onions to traders on Wednesday morning. I was able to sell only a few tonnes on the festival day and Thursday being the bandh day, there were no takers. Since onions perish fast, I will have to incur a huge loss as there is no business on Friday, he said.Jayaprakash, a member of Onion and Potato Traders Association at the APMC said 400 lorry loads of onions and potatoes have arrived at the market, which includes yields from Maharashtra and 300 more lorries are expected on Friday. Sharanappa from Chitradurga said he hoped that there were no more bandhs in the future. There are rumours that a few associations were calling for a bandh in a few days over the Cauvery water sharing issue. If that happened we will be forced to distribute our produce for free and go home empty handed, he said.Since the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) has extended full support to the bandh, there was no supply of vegetables and other essentials to markets in the City. There used to be at least 400 vehicles taking rice, pulses and vegetables to KR Market, KR Puram and other areas. The bandh has badly hit movement of vehicles, said a member of AIMTC.Rail rokoMembers of the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (T A Narayan Gowda faction) blocked the Chennai Express at the City railway station and Yeshwantpur railway station to protest against the Prime Minister directing the State government to release 9,000 cusecs of water from Cauvery river.Another group of activists stopped Samparka Kranthi Express at Yeshwantpur around 12.30 pm. KRV faction has convened a meeting of pro-Kannada organisations, farmers and thinkers at a hotel in Majestic at 2 pm on Friday to decide the future course of action regarding sharing of Cauvery water.Vidhana Soudha, Vikas Soudha and MS Building wore a deserted look on Thursday due to the bandh call. None of the ministers, including Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar, turned up at their offices. The m ajority of employees could not reach their work place in the absence public transport.Remain closedSchools, colleges and offices remained closed and most Bangaloreans preferred to stay home. Travellers to the City and local commuters were, however, stranded because public transport vehicles stayed off the roads. By 8 am, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) stopped plying buses as a precaution. The services resumed only by around 6 pm.Long-distance commuters who arrived in the City by train also found themselves with no means of reaching other towns. Abdul Jabbar, who arrived at the City Railway Station with a 14-member team of construction workers from Assam, was unaware that buses had stopped operating in the City. We want to go to Attibele and from there to our workplace. But there are no buses or private vehicles, he said.Passengers strandedRamesh Kumar, who arrived from Chitradurga on Thursday, was unable to find a government bus to take him to Madanapalli in Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh.When Deccan Herald caught up with him at 3 pm at the KSRTC bus station in Majestic, he expressed disgust at waiting for transport which never seemed to come. Passengers seeking to travel around the City were equally inconvenienced. Sudarshini R, a private bank employee, explained that apart from buses, even autorickshaws seemed to be observing bandh.I wanted to get a bus to Banashankari. I have waited since 9 am but there have been no buses. The pre-paid autorickshaw stand was shut down. The few autorickshaws available were overcharging. By late afternoon, I managed to call a friend who dropped me home. It was 3 pm by then, she said.Bowing to public pressure by 3 pm, BMTC officials finally allowed several buses to ply along main routes such as Koramangala, ITPL, KR Puram and Vijayanagar. By 6 pm, City and KSRTC bus services had been largely restored.Few takers for MetroTrains of Namma Metro, especially those operating between MG Road and Baiyappanahalli, largely escaped the bandh. However, few commuters used the Metro on Thursday. BMRCL spokesperson B L Yashwant Chauhan said that the number of passengers on Thursday was 50 per cent less than on normal days."

While KR Market decided to remain closed to support the bandh, Russel Market was shut because there was no supply of fruits and vegetables because of truckers' strike.According to Mohd Idrees Choudhury, general secretary, Russel Market Traders Association: ""The stockyard is empty and there has been no supply of fruits and vegetables today. We were falling short on supply and thus decided to remain closed for the day. The bandh added to it.""Although the market will be open on Friday, it'll be short of supply by around 50%. ""Supply will start from Thursday midnight and thus we'll working on Friday. But it will affect the price of vegetables and fruits for the next two to three days.

Rajya Sabha member and television star Smriti Irani was seen leading crowds in Maninagar,downing shutters of even medical stores and petrol pumps,which are generally spared.Chief Minister Narendra Modi represents the Maninagar assembly constituency.Most of the shops remained closed abiding by an overnight advisory that was sent out to traders about observing the bandh.Minor skirmishes were reported from Paldi and Naroda areas where police detained Sabarmati BJP MLA Geeta Patel and 24 others when they forcibly stopped BRTS buses near the Pallav crossroads. The MLA and her supporters were let off after a warning.In Naroda,supporters of Samajwadi Party halted BRTS buses and forced shops to close down,leading to a ruckus. The SP members got into an argument with policemen on bandobast duty when they were asked to move from the area.A complaint of stone-pelting on BRTS buses by unidentified persons was registered with the Ghatlodia police station.While the city Congress termed the bandh as partial or a forced one,shops in minority dominated Teen Darwaja and Jamalpur areas closed down for the first time during a BJP-led agitation.Meanwhile,at the state secretariat in Gandhinagar,Chief Minister Narendra Modi,cabinet ministers and top brass in the state government functioned as usual. Most of the government offices at the secretariat were at full-strength. Even those employees coming from Ahmedabad and nearby areas attended office.In Ahmedabad,the elected wing of the BJP and its senior central leaders came out on the streets to convince people of observing a bandh. The public transport was completely paralysed after AMC withdrew AMTS and BRTS buses early in the morning saying it was precautionary steps to avoid damage to public property.OPD units of all major hospitals suffered as the patient flow was restricted due to lack of transport and for those admitted in hospital,it was a nightmare for relatives to locate open drugs stores.SaurashtraMarkets,educational institutes,banks and business establishments remained closed in different parts of the region while it was business as usual for various industries in Rajkot.In Rajkot city,shops,shopping malls and other markets remained closed following a strong appeal made by the BJP,whose workers were seen on the streets since morning to ensure bandhs success.The Chamber of Commerce and Industry,which is led by a Congress-backed body,did not support the bandh while industries maintained that after a weekly off on Wednesday,they could not afford another days off.SuratThe bandh evoked good response in the city as markets and business establishments remained closed even as strict police arrangements were in place throughout the day.While textile,diamond and embroidery units downed their shutters voluntarily and suffered heavy losses,city BJP president Purnesh Modi and his supporters took a rally requesting retail shopkeepers and other business establishments on the Raj Marg to shut down.BJP MP C R Patil led party workers to the Udhna railway station in the morning where they stopped a goods train for 15 minutes.We did not want to trouble train passengers,so we stopped a goods train coming from Mumbai and going towards Ahmedabad. We have not disturbed emergency services, Patil said.VadodaraThe bandh evoked mixed response. While it was business as usual in several areas,cancellation of city bus services affected daily commuters.Most schools were closed.BJP MLA from Vadodara city constituency,Bhupendra Lakhawala,was seen appealing shop owners in areas such as Mandvi,Champaner Gate,Nyaymandir and Nava Bazar to shut their shops.BJP MP Balkrishna Shukla and partys BJP national spokesperson Nirmala Seetharaman marched to collectors office along with supporters and submitted a memorandum.Juhapura defies call,shops,schools remain openWhile the bandh was near total in Ahmedabad,it was business as usual in Juhapura,states biggest Muslim locality with a population of over three lakh,where all shops and schools were open.Ammar Sindhi,who runs a medical store,said there was no point in closing shops as both the ruling and Opposition parties were playing politics. Why are BJP and other Opposition parties raising a hue and cry now? When the prices of diesel and petrol were raised a year ago,what were these political parties doing? he asked,adding it was all because the elections were drawing nearer.Another shopkeeper Anjum Sheikh said if the Opposition parties were really interested in bringing down the prices of the petroleum products,they could begin from Gujarat. Why is VAT highest on petroleum products in Gujarat only? asked Sheikh.Umar Sheikh,an autorickshaw driver,complained about the steep hike in CNG prices and costly power in Gujarat. Why are Smriti Irani and other central BJP leaders who have landed in Gujarat for ensuring bandh in the state not asking Modi to take measures to check hike in electricity tariff, Sheikh said,adding that power tariff had been raised at least 22 times during the 11 years of Modis rule.Rajab Mansuri,a pan shop owner too dismissed the bandh as a politics. Have prices of petroleum products been raised for the first time that they are agitating against it now? asked Mansuri.When pointed out that FDI in retail could be against the national interests,he shot back,Dont we have Pepsi and other companies selling aerated drinks,sauce and potato chips and transferring nations wealth outside the country.Shopkeepers said that no volunteers from BJP or any other party visited Juhapura market area seeking closure of the shops.F D School,the biggest school in the Juhapura locality,was also open. Its principal Mohammed Hussain Gena said there was no impact of the bandh on the functioning of his school as all the students as well as teachers had turned up. Other schools like New Age High School and Crescent High School also remained open.Haji Asrar Mirza,a Congress corporator from the area,said he was happy that shopkeepers of his ward had not joined the BJP-sponsored bandh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
282,"Exit, followed by bull",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cursor/exit-followed-by-bull/,2012-09-22,The Times Of India,"The stock markets have expressed their joy at Mamata Banerjees exit from the Union government. It signals significant rise in the ruling coaltions internal cohesion and a chance to reform the railways under a non-Trinamool minister.In a welcome move to communicate directly with the people, rather than engage only with dissenting allies or a disruptive Opposition, the prime minister broadcast a speech explaining the logic for the reform measures that have evoked so much ire, increasing the price of diesel by Rs 5 a litre and opening up organised retail to foreign direct investment (FDI).Dr Manmohan Singh is no Bill Clinton, when it comes to clear, forceful communication of ecomomic complexity to ordinary people. But he did a fair job. The petroleum subsidies this year would add up to Rs 200,000 crore, he said and with the prise adjustment in diesel, this would come down but still be Rs 160,000 crore. Money, he explained, cannot be plucked from trees. It has to be diverted from other expenditure priorities and through borrowing. Expenditure cuts hurt welfare, excessive government borrowings raise interest costs for the rest of the economy and worry investors, who, once they take fright about macroeconomic sustainability, tend to flee. The result would be slower growth and fewer jobs and an even larger fiscal deficit, as slow growth eats into tax revenues.In other words, just by pretending that nothing has changed even when crude oil prices rise sharply, you cannot make the impact of that price rise disappear. By refusing to increase retail prices of petroleum products, all you do is to transmute the impact of global oil price changes into higher interest costs, lower growth and a generalised rise in prices. Inflation goes up in general because the subsidies that are required to hold down retail prices even as crude prices rise bloat the fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit generates excess demand in the economy, putting upward pressure on prices. It is far preferable to let petroleum price changes at the level of crude to feed through to the fuel pump, as compared to distorting all other prices and depressing growth.A theme that the PM did not touch upon is energy efficiency. Repressed energy prices act against energy efficiency. The Japanese economy is one of the most energy efficient economies of the world precisely because they repress no energy prices. Seeing the narrowing of difference in overall competitiveness between China and Japan, because rising energy efficiency has been offsetting the wage advantage the Chinese have had over the Japanese, the Chinese have started subsidising energy efficiency, instead of energy itself.India needs to decontrol diesel prices, instead of raising them every now and then. It simultaneously needs to open up fuel retailing to anyone who wants to enter the business. Right now, only those who have invested thousands of crore rupees in oil and gas infrastructure can retail fuel. This restriction must go. Competition from independent retailers would serve to remove the layers of padding that the public sector oil companies maintain in their present cost structure to claim exaggerated under-recoveries. As a result of such competition, rise in prices at the fuel pump would be muted.Dr Singh also explained the logic behind opening up organised retail to foreign investment. The biggest expected benefit is investment in rural supply chains, so that the present inefficient, costly supply chain with a multitude of intermediaries and wastage would be replaced with a modern, technology-intensive, short supply chain. This would increase farm production as well as rural incomes while also reducing prices for the consumers in towns.But for this to work, the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act must be either scrapped or amended to exempt perishables from its ambit. You also need good, motorable rural roads and availability of power in rural areas to run cold storages. If these three things are put in place, the ground would, indeed, be ready for modern logistics to be deployed in fruits and vegetables. Power can be made available running diesel generators but roads and farmers freedom to sell to whoever offers the best price rather than to those selected by the Marketing Committee are imperative.This is an area where chief ministers have to take the lead. APMC laws are state level laws. It is amazing that a state like Delhi where the only crop farmers grow on their fields is real estate still has an APMC Act. Thanks to this outdated law, the traders at Delhis subzi mandi (wholesale vegetable market) could shoo away Nafed, an agricultural cooperative federation, which had a huge stock of potatoes to sell at a time when potato prices were soaring in the retail market.Combating food inflation cannot be the job only of the central government."
283,'State won't allow FDI  in retail',http://www.deccanherald.com/content/280489/state-wont-allow-fdi-retail.html,2012-09-22,Deccan Herald,"'State won't allow FDI in retail'Bangalore, Sep 22, 2012, DHNS : 0:39 ISTThe State government has decided not to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail as it may hurt the interest of farmers and small traders in the State.Addressing reporters here on Saturday, Agriculture Marketing Minister S K Bellubi compared FDI to the entry of erstwhile East India Company which eventually led to colonisation of the country by the British.He said the State government has now realised the adverse consequences of allowing the German trade and retail giant Metro to open its cash and carry wholesale centre in Bangalore by amending the APMC Act a few years ago.FDI in retail may benefit a small section of people, but it doesnt serve the interest of a vast majority. We have decided that we do not need it, he said.The minister said the government has decided to adopt electronic tendering system of National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange Limited in 50 APMC markets in the State to sell 11 important produces: tur, copra, turmeric, dry chillies, raisin, rice, arecanut, maize, groundnut, cotton and sunflower.The first phase of work has already been completed in Gulbarga, Tiptur, Tumkur, Arsikere and Bijapur APMC markets. The system will ensure that farmers get a competitive price for their produce, said Bellubi.In addition, a maize technology park in Ranebennur, integrated rice technology park at Karatagi in Gangavati taluk of Koppal district, tur technology park in Gulbarga and coconut technology park, including coconut products research and development unit will be established at Tiptur in Tumkur district.He said that an onion and potato wholesale market development project at a cost ofRs 102 crore is being implemented on 67 acres of land at Dasanapura near Bangalore.

284,Promises to keep,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Promises-to-keep/articleshow/16552049.cms,2012-09-26,The Times Of India,"Drumfuls of dolesAkhilesh's announcement to restart the unemployment allowance spread much cheer among the state's youth. A similar announcement of Kanya Vidya Dhan - scholarship to help girls from poor families get higher education -- was also received well.Envisaged as a scheme that would allow beneficiaries to use the dole amount of Rs 1,000 per month to purchase forms or to travel to seek employment, the scheme has fast degenerated into an opportunity for many to make a quick buck at the government's expense. The scheme was not always meant to benefit those who were looking for a chance to make some easy money. There were murmurs of protest from within the bureaucratic circles as well, but all dissent was silenced following a clear diktat.Systematic amendments to the dole scheme, since its inception in March 2012, were introduced in order to attract more beneficiaries. First, the government dropped a clause, which made it mandatory that all applicants for unemployment allowance turn in their asset details. This was followed by two more amendments that said the beneficiaries would no longer have to work if the government asked them to. It also relaxed the age limit for beneficiaries by bringing it down from 30 to 25.A total of 1.48 lakh applications were received out of which 88, 962 were found eligible. Of these, 10,000-odd applicants from Lucknow and six adjoining districts have received the dole for August and September. The remaining 78,000-odd eligible applicants will receive the amount in next phases.Laptops booting upDistributing free laptops and tablets to meritorious students of High School and Intermediate was one promise in the SP's poll manifesto which attracted maximum interest. Naturally, after coming to power it was on top priority of the party. The first major step towards the implementation of the scheme was taken in April, barely a month after Akhilesh Yadav was sworn in as the chief minister on March 15, 2012. The Uttar Pradesh Electronic Corporation Limited (UPECL) was appointed as the nodal agency for the scheme on June 4, 2012. The UPECL introduced e-tendering to maintain transparency for appointment of consultants for the scheme the same day. In the meantime, the government struggled to appoint a technical committee to decide upon the production of computers and laptops to be distributed and also the agency from which it could be procured. It was only after the CM himself suggested constitution of a committee comprising experts in computer technology from the faculties of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur and other institution of equal stature. Even government sources admit that the actual distribution of laptops and tablets will start somewhere around January 2013.Sari, no blanketsSamajwadi Party government's poll promise to the below poverty line (BPL) population of two saris each to women and blankets to the elderly persons is also yet to take off. Sources concede that it will not be possible for the government to give away the sarees and blankets January 2013.This when the chief minister himself constituted a group of ministers headed by minister for panchyati raj Balram Yadav way back in April to plan and implement the scheme. The GoM nominated a core committee comprising chief secretary and principal secretaries from three departments to formulate the eligibility criteria, finalize the specifications for the sari and blanket and to place orders for bulk supply.The core committee submitted its recommendations on June 18, but the GoM could meet only on September 10 only to recommend the formation of a technical committee to finalise the specifications for the dole. The technical committee has yet to be formed. ""Recommendations and criteria given by the technical committee will be placed before the GoM for a final call,"" said Director Panchyati Raj VP Singh.Algebra of compensationIn the run-up to the 2012 state polls, the Samajwadi Party promised that the state's existing land acquisition policy, enacted by the Mayawati government, would be trashed and a new one brought in. According to their projections, the SP was hoping to cash in on the farmers' vote bank, which was largely unhappy after their land was wrested out of their hands without adequate compensation in return.To mark the completion of the government's six months in power, the chief minister, at a press conference said that the government had done plenty to protect the interests of farmers. He also announced that water from government-run canals and tubewells would be supplied to farmers free of cost. However, the chief minister was mum on the fate of the land acquisition policy.The party has promised in its manifesto that the new land acquisition policy would ensure no land was acquired without the express consent of the owners; it also mandated that only barren and waste land would be acquired. Most significantly-what bureaucratic circles read as a 'foolhardy' decision- SP promises that they would acquire land at six times the circle rates.At the time of implementing the decision, sources in the government openly said the move was economically unviable and would result in all other development schemes coming to a standstill. In June, though, Akhilesh in an exclusive interview to TOI, insisted that his government would indeed give compensation equivalent to six times the market rates to farmers. Three months later, there is still no word on the policy document. Sources in the government said the chief minister had to drop plans to effect the changes after senior members from his own family (Uncle Shivpal) wrote to the chief minister seconding the bureaucratic opinion.Subsequently, land has acquired in the western parts of the state, but the government has only paid the farmers up to three times the circle rates for the land acquired. Later, when questioned about the government's changed stance, Akhilesh said it was still a win-win for all concerned, considering that the farmers would be unable to extract any more out of private developers.Delayed minority reportFor the Samajwadi Party, frequently seen walking the tight rope between SP Muslim leader Azam Khan and Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the minority quota is a political hot potato that the party would like to forget. Though the SP has now sworn to lend its support to the UPA government, the SP was among the biggest critics of the Congress party when it spoke of 4.5% quota for Muslim. In fact, SP ventured to promise that 18% reservations would be given to minority communities in UP if the party was voted to power. Six months into the power, though, Akhilesh and his father Mulayam have both maintained a stoic silence on the issue.According to political analysts, there's reason why the SP can never effect any concrete changes in minority reservations. To begin with, reservation on religious grounds at present is unconstitutional. For it to be effected, an amendment to the constitution would be mandatory. Secondly, the SP is also caught in a bind, doing the balancing act between the Yadavs, its traditional vote bank and the Muslims.In UP, Yadavs constitute approximately 7% of the population. In contrast, Muslims account for about 20% and 70% of the Muslims belong to the backward category. If the state government really wants, it can, under the existing 27% minority quota reservation modify the quota within quota policy. As a result, the benefits of reservation under the existing policy would be passed down in preferential order to Yadavs, Kurmis, Jats and Gujjars. Interestingly, a majority of the SP's Muslim MLAs belong to the upper caste - Sheikh, Syed, Pathan and Shia, who are untouched by any reservation policy and therefore not really representatives of most of the Muslims in UP. In other words this means that both backward Muslims and the most backward classes, among all categories, fail to reap the benefits of the reservation policy, something that the Samajwadi Party chooses to remain silent about.Long wait for waiverFor the most part, people are still confused about what the government wants to do with the loan waiver scheme. The first time the chief minister spoke of it after the budget session, the mandate was clear-the government would waive up to Rs 50,000 worth of farm loans for all small and marginal farmers who took loans from any government-run bank.Then came the realization that the largesse would cost the state government a whopping Rs 14,000 crore. So, it first announced that the loan waiver scheme would only apply to those farmers who had mortgaged their lands for loans. That ensured only those farmers who had taken loans for the Land Development Bank would benefit, considering it is the only one that loans up to Rs 50,000 to farmers against agricultural land.Then, to further reduce the number of beneficiaries, waiver will be effective to those farmers who have paid back at least 10% of the principal amount. Now, with beneficiaries cut down to 3.5 lakh farmers - at a cost of approximately Rs 1,500 crore, the scheme is expected to be announced soon."
285,Look who all are supporting FDI and reforms now……,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-real-truth/look-who-all-are-supporting-fdi-and-reforms-now/,2012-09-26,The Times Of India,"Ten days after the big bang reforms announcement by the government, and ten days after big bang protests by the opposition, the real picture on who stands where is starting to become clear. The bad politics is separating from the good economics. The support for the governments economic reforms agenda is growing, most of all for FDI in retail. Save and except for the whining of a sulking BJP, most others are coming around to accepting the truth about reforms.Arun Shourie, senior BJP leader, and a gutsy ex-minister himself, was the first to come out openly and strongly in support of the governments decisions to increase diesel prices and introduce FDI in several sectors including retail. By saying that the PM had taken tough decisions, he showed himself to be a statesman  abandoning petty politics for the national good.Then there is the Akali Dal  the party which initially wrote to the government expressing support for FDI in retail. Later under pressure, they joined the NDA in opposing the reforms. The Indian Express today reports that the party would be happy to allow FDI in retail in Punjab, provided the Center addresses the fears of the stakeholders and provides a sense of security to them. This is nothing but a face saver. The Badals realize the impact contract farming has had on the farmers and their preference for it. Having worked in Pepsi in the past, I fully understand how potato farmers in Punjab gained from the association with the company. The farmers of Punjab want FDI in retail  not because they like FDI per se  but because they want more facilities to be created.And that is the crux of the FDI matter. It is not as if FDI in retail is the solution to all our problems. It is not as if we cannot create our own cold storage chains. It doesnt matter whether Walmart is welcome in New York or not (Advani was misinformed as was made obvious by the statement of the Asia CEO of Walmart yesterday). What matters is that we need all the investment we can get. We need a trillion dollars for our infrastructure buildup and we should be keen to grab with both hands whatever is available wherever in the world. The days of swadeshi are over. The days of being global and being smart are here.Not surprising then that the Punjab Farmers commission  a government advisory  is likely to meet Badal to ask him to allow FDI in retail. This could help small and marginal farmers move away from Paddy into other high-yielding cash crops likes fruits and vegetables. But this can only happen if the farmers are given marketing and pricing support, which FDI would help in. Not surprising also that Chengal Reddy, Secretary General of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association (CIFA) has been crying hoarse in support of FDI in retail. Not surprising also that Rahul Gandhi had the gumption to support FDI in retail in front of a farmers gathering in UP back in Nov-Dec 2011 when the government had first announced the FDI decision.There is also an informed view that Naveen Patnaik is not opposed to the reforms and specifically to FDI in retail. Thats why he didnt support the bandh called by the Left and the BJP. Again, and very significantly, Raj Thackeray in Maharashtra has supported both the diesel price hike and the FDI in retail saying he understood the economic compulsions behind the moves. His only caveat: recruit more marathi manoos, a compromise the Walmarts will be happy to make! (Even today, most shop floor workers in modern format retail come from the state itself).Likewise, in spite of the rhetoric of Mulayam Singh Yadav, son Akhilesh appears to be in favor of allowing FDI in retail into his state. I have a feeling that he may strike some sort of a compromise on the issue  restricting the Walmarts of the world to the NCR but leaving the rest of the state out of reach for the first few years. Akhilesh knows that NOIDA and Ghaziabad and even cities farther away like Agra and Meerut are dependent on Delhi for their economy. Having a Walmart there to attract the crowds from Delhi would make good economic sense. After all, if UP can have a Formula 1 racing track, why not a Walmart?!Then of course the Chief Justice of India has given a backhand support for reforms, recognizing that it is only fast economic growth that can bring out the best in a democracy.So support for reforms and support in particular for FDI in retail is becoming widespread. The only serious opposition is from the Left  which is a party with 18th century ideology. So its completely understandable. The BJPs opposition is mere opportunism just as so much of its politics is. There is a strong feeling that Narendra Modi will be the first one to welcome Walmart into Gujarat. With the economic progress that one sees in Gujarat (no thanks to Modi!) and with the wide roads in the state (thx to the NHAI  a Central government undertaking!), and the generally progressive mindset of the Gujaratis, there will be pressure on Modi to allow FDI in retail. Let the Gujarat elections get over; and Modi will be scurrying to be the first to inaugurate a global retail biggie in Ahmedabad! I wonder where Advani will hide for cover at that time!The real truth is that once we remove the opportunistic opposition to reforms, we find a very encouraging picture. The people of India are pro-reforms; some of the major parties are not. Ultimately, it is the will of the people that counts in a democracy. The BJP lost the 2009 elections because it made the mistake of opposing the Indo-US nuclear deal. The BJP had now better be careful in opposing the reforms."
286,Spain's hungry seek food in trash bins,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/281518/spains-hungry-seek-food-trash.html,2012-09-28,Deccan Herald,"Spain's hungry seek food in trash binsSuzanne Daley,September 28, 2012, NYT: 22:06 ISTA recent report found that 22 per cent of Spanish households are living in povertyOn a recent evening, a hip-looking young woman was sorting through a stack of crates outside a fruit and vegetable store here in the working-class neighbourhood of Vallecas as it shut down for the night.At first glance, she looked like she might be a store employee. But no. The young woman was looking through the days trash for her next meal. Already, she had found a dozen aging potatoes she deemed edible and had loaded them onto the luggage cart parked nearby. When you dont have enough money, she said, declining to give her name, this is what there is.The woman, 33, said that she had once worked at the post office but that her unemployment benefits had run out and she was living now on 400 euros a month, about $520. She was squatting with some friends in a building that still had water and electricity, while collecting a little of everything from the garbage after stores closed and the streets were dark and quiet.Such survival tactics are becoming increasingly commonplace here, with an unemployment rate more than 50 per cent among young people and more and more households having adults without jobs. So pervasive is the problem of scavenging that one Spanish city has resorted to installing locks on supermarket trash bins as a public health precaution.A report by a Catholic charity, Caritas, this year said that it had fed nearly 1 million hungry Spaniards in 2010, more than twice as many as in 2007.That number rose again in 2011 by 65,000. As Spain tries desperately to meet its budget targets, it has been forced to embark on the same path as Greece, introducing one austerity measure after another, cutting jobs, salaries, pensions and benefits, even as the economy continues to shrink.Most recently, the government raised the value-added tax 3 percentage points, to 21 per cent, on most goods, and 2 percentage points on many food items, making life just that much harder for those on the edge. Little relief is in sight as the countrys regional governments, facing their own budget crisis, are chipping away at a range of previously free services, including school lunches for low-income families.For a growing number, the food in garbage bins helps make ends meet. At the huge wholesale fruit and vegetable market on the outskirts of this city recently, workers bustled, loading crates onto trucks. But in virtually every bay, there were men and women furtively collecting items that had rolled into the gutter.Its against the dignity of these people to have to look for food in this manner, said Eduardo Berloso, an official in Girona, the city that padlocked its supermarket trash bins. Berloso proposed the measure last month after hearing from social workers and seeing for himself one evening the humiliating gesture of a mother with children looking around before digging into the bins.The Caritas report also found that 22 per cent of Spanish households were living in poverty and that about 600,000 had no income whatsoever. All these numbers are expected to continue to get worse in the coming months. About a third of those seeking help, the Caritas report said, had never used a food pantry or a soup kitchen before the economic crisis hit. For many of them, the need to ask for help is deeply embarrassing. In some cases, families go to food pantries in neighbouring towns so their friends and acquaintances will not see them.Angry reactionsIn Madrid recently, as a supermarket prepared to close for the day in the Entrevias district of Vallecas, a small crowd gathered, ready to pounce on the garbage bins that would shortly be brought out to the curb. Most reacted angrily to the presence of journalists. In the end, few managed to get anything as the trucks whisked the garbage away within minutes.Others admitted to foraging through the trash. Victor Victorio, 67, an immigrant from Peru, said he came here regularly to find fruits and vegetables tossed in the garbage. Victorio, who lost his job in construction in 2008, said he lived with his daughter and contributed whatever he found  on this day, peppers, tomatoes and carrots  to the household. This is my pension, he said.For the wholesalers who have businesses here, the sight of people going through the scraps is hard. It is not nice to see what is happening to these people, said Manu Gallego, the manager of Canniad Fruit. It shouldnt be like this.In Girona, Berloso said his aim in locking down the bins was to keep people healthy and push them to get food at licensed pantries and soup kitchens. As the locks are installed on the bins, the town is posting civilian agents nearby with vouchers instructing people to register for social services and food aid. He said 80-100 people had been regularly sorting through the bins before he took action, with a strong likelihood that many more were relying on thrown-away food to get by.But Berlosos locks created something of an uproar across Spain, where the economic crisis is fueling more and more protests highlighting hunger.A group of mayors and unionists in southern Spain, where unemployment rates are far above the average, recently staged Robin Hood raids on two supermarkets, loading carts with basic foods and pressing them to donate more food to the needy. More than a dozen are facing prosecution for theft over the stunt. But they are unrepentant and appear to have huge local support.Taking some food and giving it to families who are having a really hard time, if this is stealing, I am guilty, one of the men, Francisco Molero of the farmworkers SAT union, told the local news media afterwards.Some politicians say Gironas locks are really all about protecting Gironas image. Dominated by medieval buildings and the picturesque cobblestone streets of a beautifully preserved former Jewish quarter, the city of about 100,000 derives most of its income from tourism.The unemployment rate is still relatively low in Girona  14 per cent overall, compared with 25 per cent for the country as a whole. But more and more families have no income. Of the 7,700 unemployed in Girona, Berloso said, 40 per cent have now run out of benefits. Many, he said, were people who never expected find themselves in this position.Ramon Barnera, who runs the Caritas programmes in Girona, said the organisation realized early on that shame was a factor preventing people from coming forward to ask for food. So three years ago, it helped create food distribution sites that looked more like supermarkets, and removed the charitys name from the outside of the building.We looked for a system that would give dignity, Barnera said. This is not easy for people.On a recent morning, Juan Javier, 29, who had come to collect milk, pasta, vegetables and eggs from one of the distribution centres, was one of the few clients who would discuss his circumstances. A former printer, he has been out of work for two years. I would like to have a job, he said, and not be here."
287,Retail farming: The ground truth from Bengal,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Retail-farming-The-ground-truth-from-Bengal/articleshow/16582434.cms,2012-09-28,The Times Of India,"BARASAT: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee wants to go to the ""people"" to decide the multi-retail FDI issue. She only has to travel 45km, to Amdanga in Barasat, to see the other side of the retail story  where farmers have disposable incomes, and can afford luxuries like an LCD TV, a motorbike or marble flooring.Domestic multi-retail trade that touched base in Bengal about two and a half years ago has changed the lives of farmers who embraced the new model of farm-marketing, cutting out middlemen and selling their produce directly to retail giants like Metro Cash & Carry, Big Bazar, Reliance and Keventer. On the other hand, if you drive down to Nagar Ukhra in Nadia, you would see piles of pumpkins rotting by the roadside.The same crop that often goes for peanuts in distress sale in other parts of the state fetches big bucks for the Amdanga farmers who supply to the organized retail industry. It is a truth that the chief minister cannot ignore.While the picture in the traditional mundi/haats of Bengal has not changed in half a century  there is still the chaos, the cut-throat bargaining to cut farmers' profits, and extortion  the six multi-retail collection centres in Amdanga are all about cellophane packaging, laptops, palmtops and the orderliness that is a feature of any business chain.When TOI went to meet Subhas Ghosh, a farmer in Bodai, about 7km from Barasat town, he was relaxing with his grandkids in front of a Samsung LCD TV. He seemed content. There was no worry of the next morning  no chasing after vans to carry his produce, no hectic phone calls to know the retail price in Kolkata. He could sit back and watch a Bengali soap.As he took off his earphones and flashed a smile, the oft-exploited image of the impoverished, battered Bengal farmer seemed to crumble.""Vegetable farming isn't a losing game. In two years I have bought an LCD, renovated my house and bought a computer. I did all this by selling kundri, sheem and beans,"" laughed Ghosh, proudly pointing at the marble tiles under his feet. It's significant to note that he had at least Rs 1 lakh in disposable income to indulge in his little luxuries  something unthinkable for the average Bengal farmer who cannot even afford decent fertilizer.In Amdanga, there are plenty of examples where a middle-level farmer with guidance from corporate houses has made it big through organised retail. Ghosh led TOI to the collection centre  a two-storied house next to the agricultural fields. The ground floor has been taken on rent by 'aggregator' Asiful Hossain, who supplies the fresh produce to Metro Cash & Carry, Big Bazar and Keventer.Rather than the cacophony of a mundi, the godown is a picture of system and order. An electronic weighing machine sits to one side. Vegetables are kept in colourful crates. Asiful, a commerce graduate from Barasat College, records everything on Excel sheets on his laptop. The handlers are careful with every piece of vegetable as they haul the crates into a mini-truck or wrap them in transparent plastic. Disfigured or damaged vegetables won't make it to the shelves.Ghosh and his ilk don't have to wait for the money. ""The rate is fixed in advance  Rs 13 for each kilo of ladies finger. It is always above the local mundi rates. Only, the produce has to meet the quality parameters,"" Ghosh said.Compare this with the hurly burly in the nearby Kamdevpur Haat, where farmers in rickshaw vans are kept waiting for hours with their produce dumped on the ground. Everyone seems to get a different price. The first lot of ladies fingers sold for Rs 12 a kg on Thursday. The next ones fetched hardly Rs 8 or Rs 9 a kilo. The touts call the shots here. Farmers are at their mercy.Tomato grower Samar Senapati is glad that he is no longer part of this chaos. He does not know the difference between Keventer  who he sells to  and Walmart. All he knows is that he has made enough money in the last two years to buy a motorbike. ""I have heard about FMDI (read FDI) but I do not know how it operates. Left to myself I would always prefer this advanced system that has helped me go a long way when many of my fellow farmers have given up and sold off their land to builders,"" Senapati said.He wants more ""bideshi companies"" to come in. ""If there were more such chains, I could sell my entire produce,"" Senapati said.Mahiuddin Mondal and Bablu Gazi of Bagda in North 24-Parganas agree. ""Middlemen dominate the traditional marketing routes. Our produce goes through at least four to five hands before it reaches Kolkata. We have no control over the price. We are left at the mercy of the touts, who work in cartels and manipulate the price on a daily basis. For instance, the mundi rate for 50 kg potato is around Rs 600, while the rate at Metro Cash & Carry is Rs 625,"" Gazi said. Mondal pointed out another bonus: ""We also get advice on the right use of fertiliser and pesticides from companies like Bayer. This has reduced our cost of production."""
288,"Vicious spiral of big crops, bigger losses",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Vicious-spiral-of-big-crops-bigger-losses/articleshow/16597104.cms,2012-09-29,The Times Of India,"PURSURAH (HOOGHLY): Every time there is a bumper crop in his field, Kashinath Maity of Uttarpara feels jittery. To him, a bumper crop only means distress sale and huge input losses. ""Last year, the price plunged to such a low that I sold off my harvest at Rs 25 per 50-kilo 'packet' (50 paise per kilo). I know many of my fellow potato growers threw their year's labour into the ponds,"" said Kashinath.This year production is balanced and the price seems to be stabilized. The production this year is 85 lakh metric tonnes against 1.05 crore metric tonnes in 2011. By the time prices were jacked up last year, the distress sale was over and thousands of farmers ruined. ""Only big farmers, who could overcome the fear of distress sale, got Rs 180 per packet. But even they could not recover input costs,"" said Kesab Ghosh, Tarakeswar Krishi Samabai Samity chairman.The state government may be rooting for the traditional marketing chain, but it has not been able to control the fluctuation of prices, the manipulation by middlemen, and the hoarding by mahajans that have tormented farmers for decades. The potato market is still controlled by a section of very influential middlemen. They are the ones that make or break a potato-grower. ""The fear of distress sale is so ingrained in us that I sold high quality Chandramukhi potatoes at Rs 320 a packet (50-kg sack), which makes it Rs 6.40 a kg,"" says Nitai Mondal, who has to do odd-jobs so that his family does not go hungry.Mondal knows that the potato he sold to the foreys (middlemen) at Rs 6.40 per kg is now being sold in Kolkata at Rs 18 per kg. Wonder why the price rises by 300% by the time it reaches your para market in Kolkata? It's due to a long chain of foreys (middlemen) who thrive at the expense of farmers.The farmer sells part of his produce to middlemen. The rest goes into cold-storages, which issue bonds against the stored potatoes. When the stocks are 'released', another brand of intermediaries - unemployed youths of the village - comes into the picture. They collect the bonds against the prevailing market price and usually get a margin of Rs 5 per packet when they sell the bonds to mahajans (big intermediaries). However, in the fluctuating market, these bond-sellers also incur losses if the mahajan's price plunges below the farmer's bond-price.The mahajan is the biggest fish in the food chain. He has a big role in determining the price of potatoes to maximise his profit. It is here that potatoes are hoarded and deliberately coated in ela soil and brick dust to cheat on weight. ""When the potato comes from the fields it is very clean. Dust is added to it later. The ela-clay makes the potato harder and worsens the taste,"" said Kesab Ghosh.TOI met one such mahajan, Haripada De, in his sprawling gaddi. He was reluctant to divulge his trade secrets and only said that he invests Rs 6 lakh at harvest time and takes home a neat 200% profit. He insisted he was small fry. ""There are much bigger mahajans who deal in crores,"" he said.Once the potatoes reach the urban wholesale markets, there is another chain of intermediaries - dala-party, which keeps a margin of Rs 10 per packet, haat palla, which keeps another Rs 10-20, and finally Khaoke party (retailer). By the time, you stand before your friendly neighbourhood potato seller, the long chain has inflated the price to Rs 18 a kilo. Yet the likes of Kashinath Maity stare at another year of selling potatoes at Rs 6.4 a kilo - if they are lucky."

Morigoan is the worst hit district in Lower Assam with 371 villages comprising over five lakh people affected.After arrival from Japan on Thursday, chief minister Tarun Gogoi visited flood-affected areas in Morigaon and other Upper Assam districts. He also did an aerial survey of flood-hit Kaziranga. Gogoi visited two relief camps in Morigaon district's Mayong revenue circle accompanied by food and civil supplies minister Nazrul Islam, minister for fisheries Basanta Das and other ministers and officialsGogoi directed the Morigaon district administration to reach out to the flood-affected people with relief materials and asked the ministers to closely monitor the situation. Later, the chief minister undertook a one-and-a-half-hour-long aerial survey of flood hit Darrang, Sonitpur, Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Kazaringa National Park and Majuli. Gogoi also reviewed the flood situation with water resources minister Rajib Lochan Pegu and the district administration in Jorhat on Thursday. Gogoi will make an aerial survey of flood hit areas of Sivasagar, Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts on Saturday.Agriculture minister Nilomoni Sen Deka said 3, 28, 516 hectares of agricultural land has been affected in the second wave of floods that hit the state in the middle of this month. Twenty districts have been affected and 19 people killed. Ten people are still missing in the second wave of deluge.Deka said once the flood situation improves, the agriculture department will undertake free distribution of seeds and free tractor services for 4,10,309 hectare of agricultural lands. He added that about Rs 200 crore will be spent to help flood-affected farmers with free seeds and other agricultural services.""We are going to distribute hybrid paddy, along with mustard, potato and other crop seeds, to the flood-hit farmers free of cost so that they can make up for the loss. We have also decided to support the farmers in Majuli for double cropping,"" said Deka."

A broken man, he decided to sell off his land and move to the city as a manual labourer. Just then, Pepsico came up to him with a proposal for contract farming. He accepted it with a lot of doubt and suspicion. But today, his eyes light up when he recalls the day he told himself 'I've got nothing left to lose'.""It was a godsend,"" he says. All five brothers of Kesh family are now engaged in 'Pepsi-aloo' farming. A tractor stands in front of Taraknath's sprawling house. And he easily makes Rs 6 lakh a year.""Aaj amader sokh puran korte parchi (we can now fulfill our desires). My children study in good schools. We can undertake pilgrimage a couple of times a year. My wife is happy, so are my children,"" said Taraknath, proudly giving TOI a tour of his house.Earlier, he used to farm Jyoti, a local variety of potato. ""Every alternative year, there would be a fungal attack (known here as Dhasha rog). Moreover, I suffered losses because the price crashed frequently in the highly fluctuating market,"" said Taraknath. Pepsi aloo changed his life. He and his brothers grow two varieties - Atlanta and Chipsona potato (chip-grade, low on sugar and water content). Pepsico supplies the seeds and give them farming tips.""I have twice won awards for productivity,"" said Taraknath's brother Lakshman, who was the first in Goghra village to start contract farming. The Kesh success story has inspired others.Harikrishna Sain has also tasted prosperity within a short span of switching to Pepsi-aloo. You cannot miss his newly built two-storey house in the village. The least bothered about the hullabaloo over multi-retail FDI, Sain did some straight-talking. ""We went for it because it is profitable. We will stop it the day it isn't. They (Pepsico) cannot force us. Since the choice is ours, what is the harm in taking the help of big companies like Pepsico,"" he asks.""We have learnt a lot from Pepsico. We have learnt scientific farming with judicious use of fertilizer and pesticides. The soil is tested first. On the basis of the report, Pepsico appoints agriculture experts to advise us on the quantity of fertilizer and pesticides within the Pepsico policy of use of pesticides. The fertility of our land has increased dramatically. Now, we realise how we used to destroy the fertility of our land with overdoses of chemical fertilizer hoping it would increase productivity,"" said Lakshman.Kesh and Sain make a profit of Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per bigha. Last, year Pepsico bought their potatoes for Rs 5.70 to Rs 6.10 per kg. This year, it has gone up to Rs 6.4 per kg. In contrast, the Jyoti variety is selling for Rs 3.40 to Rs 4.5 per kilo in the mundi when the market is on the upswing.Pepsico buys the crop through vendors at a fixed price. The farmers get the money instantly and don't have to haggle with middlemen.Encouraged by its own success, Pepsico has targeted 8,000 acres of potato farming this year, up from 5,000 acres last year. ""There is a marked change in the attitude of the farmers towards us. Initially, they used to look at us with suspicion. But now they have realized that there is stability and assured profits,"" said a Pepsico official."

The quality is degraded and the prices are expected to be higher till the local harvest from Punjab arrives, he adds.Cauliflower has seen decreased exports of 2,969 bags from 4,681 in August,with an average daily supply of 10,000 kg,reducing to 1,200 kg on some days.As a result,the prices of the vegetables have increased exponentially over the same period. Peas have been selling for Rs 130 per kg this week and cauliflower is priced at Rs 100 in retail markets.However,some villages have not been affected by the rainfall in Himachal Pradesh. Onion and tomato,both of which are being imported from Maharashtra,have remained relatively unaffected,while potato imports are picking up.A vegetable that has registered a reverse trend,exhibiting an arrival of double over the last month with the price reducing from Rs 70 to 15 per kg in the mandis is cucumber,September- October being the season for its cultivation, says Amit.

Vegetable traders attributed the price rise to lax supply of local vegetables.A vendor, Amit Kumar said, ""Large portions of fields under local vegetables have rotted, while seasonal varieties have got exhausted. Vegetables are now being brought from neighboring states.""A housewife, Aarti Negi, said that whatever she cooks in her kitchen now depends on its price, not on her family's tastes.

295,Presi ‘privatisation’ storm in coffee cup,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1121011/jsp/calcutta/story_16077769.jsp,2012-10-11,Telegraph,"Presidency University might want to be world-class. Its students might aspire to study abroad and work with global business giants. But they wont sip coffee served by a multinational chain. A Barista Lavazza caf on Presidencys College Street campus was forced shut on Wednesday after a two-day siege by students inspired by the legacy of disruptive opposition in Bengal. Boys and girls in jeans and T-shirts proclaimed they couldnt bear an MNCs presence. Nobody in authority dared tell them that their clothes represented possibly the most popular western export to this part of the world. By allowing an MNC to do business from our campus, the authorities are promoting privatisation. We cant allow this, said Debarshi Chakraborty, a spokesperson for the student outfit Independent Consolidation. This state is familiar with such protests and their outcome. Students at Presidency behaved like their older political cousins and prevented Barista staff from entering the outlet on Tuesday. A leaflet distributed by them said: If MNCs like Barista start their business in a government institution like Presidency University, Walmart will come to the campus tomorrow to sell potato and wax gourd; ITC will want to sell cigarettes together with exercise books and then we will see a physics department sponsored by someone and an English department sponsored by someone. Student leaders in this city are apparently blinkered from the reality of how some of the worlds more reputable universities function, institutions where endowments provided by private companies or individuals are used to fund teacher posts. The posts are named after the sponsor. This is something the Presidency mentor group wants to do for the 194-year-old institution as well so that it is freed from state control. I have heard about the protest but dont know what their complaint is, vice-chancellor Malabika Sarkar said. Some Independent Consolidation leaders said they were angry because the university was subsidising the caf. The money being spent on the private entity could have been used differently, said Bibaswan Basu, a postgraduate student. We have been asking for a journal library, computer room, cheap stores and a cheap canteen. We think Barista, which is very expensive, is not what the college should be investing in. In a memorandum to registrar Prabir Dasgupta, the students cited a space crunch on the College Street campus for their agitation. Presidency denied subsidising the caf. A senior official said the institution had only provided space to Barista, owned by the Italian coffee chain Lavazza. A source in the company, which runs 225 outlets across India, said its relationship with Presidency was the same as that of other corporate clients. They provide the space and we run the outlet at lower rates than normal, he said. The company declined to comment on the protest. It is Presidencys internal issue, regional manager Chetan Kumar Agarwalla said. So would Barista pull out of Presidency? There are no such plans. We are very happy with our presence there, Agarwalla said. Registrar Dasgupta said a Barista official had called him on Tuesday to inform him about the resistance from students. The company official said some students were not letting the staff enter the ground-floor caf in the main building. I suggested that they should not confront the students, Dasgupta told Metro. The Barista employees did not turn up on Wednesday. The university authorities locked the room housing the caf. The scene outside the locked door would resemble any locked-out factory gate. Its not about Barista. Its all about privatisation of Presidency, one poster read. Only in this case, seated in front were students who want MNCs to come to their campus to recruit them. Dyuti Roy, a second-year postgraduate student of English, said she had a fight with the protesters on Tuesday. I told them that if they were so cut up with MNCs, they should come to the university in dhuti-panjabi. Many students who preferred Promodedas canteen to Barista said the forced shutdown was unnecessary. I may not like Barista but that doesnt mean I will force a shutdown. The canteen and the caf could have happily co-existed on the campus, said one. A teacher disgusted at the protest pointed out the irony of these same students running after MNCs for sponsorship ahead of their fest."

With storm water drains clogged at several parts of the city, rain water had gushed into residential areas and school compounds. Roads where the city corporation is carrying out underground drainage work looked like mud wrestling pits.Incidents of people falling into pits dug for laying storm water drains were reported from many places. Fortunately, none suffered any major injury. Traffic flow was affected after three pits were formed on Mettupalayam road near Sivananda Colony. Normalcy was restored in most of these localities by late afternoon and corporation workers began to level the roads and remove the mud from the main roads in some of these areas.At some places like Saibaba Koil, public anger against the shoddy work of the corporation spilled out into the streets. ""None of the drains have been properly cleaned and there is no way for water to flow out. It was impossible to walk out of the house,"" said KB Sreeram, a resident of Palanisamy II Street near Saibaba Koil.Residents of this street staged a demonstration on the main street near Saibaba Koil forcing corporation officials and police to rush to the spot. A bulldozer and few civic workers were dispatched immediately to clear the mess. Residents claimed that a class 9 student lost her footing and fell into one of the pits dug for laying storm water drains. ""The work has been going on for a long time now. Due to water logging, it was extremely dangerous even to walk through the street since we can't locate the drainage lines,"" said G Muthu, a grocery shop owner on the street.Similar situation prevailed in numerous areas including Satya Nagar, Chinna Subbannan Gounder Street and some parts of NSR Street where stagnant water created major issues for residents and motorists. ""I was constantly trying to get in touch with the UGD contractors to get the mud lying on the street cleared, but they did not turn up until people came out and protested,"" said K Nagaraj, councillor, ward no 10, Coimbatore Municipal Corporation.Traffic movement was suspended through Avinashi Bridge underpass after it got blocked with garbage and slush washed in with the gushing rain water. The heavy rain also affected low lying areas on Lanka Corner, Ukkadam, Gandhipuram, Sanganoor Road and Rathinapuri.Traders in MGR wholesale market claimed that they will have to lower the price of goods especially onions, potatoes and cabbages that were stacked outside their stalls due to the damage caused by the showers and the standing water. More than 10,000 loads of onion are sent from this wholesale market to other states and also to various parts of the city on a regular basis. ""There are no proper roofing and storage facilities in the market. The drains are blocked with garbage. When it rains, the mud and slush from outside also flow into the market complex,"" said A Mohammed Ali, a wholesale onion dealer."

Besides diesel, aviation turbine fuel and kerosene also turned dearer. As for diesel alone, inflation for the segment went up by 8.94 per cent.As per the WPI data, the fresh spurt in inflation in September, 2012, is despite a high base of 10 per cent in the same month a year ago and economic analysts view that the rising price trend is likely to limit the headroom available to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to tweak its key policy rates later this month as a measure to kick-start the investment cycle and boost growth.Commenting on the inflation numbers, Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) Chairman C. Rangarajan noted that although he expected the inflation level to decline going forward, the current situation was not favourable for the RBI to go in for a rate cut. When inflation continues to rise, it becomes a very difficult situation...I am only saying that the circumstances are not too favourable [for easing policy rates], he said.Although food inflation declined to 7.86 per cent in September from 9.14 per cent in August, wheat was costlier by 18.63 per cent and cereals by 14.18 per cent on a year-on-year basis.

Prices of eggs, meat and fish were also higher by 12.44 per cent while milk and fruits were dearer by 6.25 per cent and 6.96 per cent, respectively on an annual basis. Inflation in the manufactured products category also inched up to 6.26 per cent in September from 6.14 per cent in August with items such as cotton textiles, paper and paper products, rubber and plastic products costing more.India Inc., however, sought to argue in favour of a rate cut by the RBI. Apex chamber CII noted that the headline inflation had increased marginally in spite of increase in fuel prices, especially that of diesel and the impact has been lower than expected. In a statement, the chambers Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee pointed to the good news that food prices had witnessed a decline in prices in September 2012 as compared to the previous month and manufacturing prices remain reasonably stable. The declining trajectory of inflation should spur the RBI to revisit its monetary policy stance and cut its policy rates to rejuvenate growth in the industry, he said."

A Bengali food festival in a nook of Bhangagarh is brewing up something special, something very Calcutta. Stealing the show at Natures Cuisine, the fine dining restaurant at MPS Food Hub, which is offering a sumptuous slice of Calcutta, is the buffet. People can choose from mishti pulao (sweetened pulao), chingri macher malai curry (prawn in coconut milk), doi mach (curd fish), murgir jhol (chicken curry in thin gravy), potoler dorma (pointed gourd stuffed with cottage cheese and mashed potato), narkel diye cholar dal (Bengal gram with grated coconut), Radha ballabhi (puri stuffed with dal), jhurjhure aloo bhaja (thin, crispy potato fry) and shukto (mild mixed vegetable) for the main course. The dessert includes mishti doi and kesar phirni. The dishes, to be served on earthen plates and glasses, can take on the best of Bengali thaalis. Thats for a cool Rs 400 per person. The objective of the two-week festival that got under way on Monday is to satiate the taste buds of all those who miss the flavour of Bengal during Puja. We have set up four counters for the festival on the ground floor. The sweet counter is inside our coffee shop, Blend N Brew, while the other three have been set up outside the shop. It remains chock-a-block in the evenings. While the footfall for the buffet (lunch and dinner) has been average so far, we expect a full house of 65 from Sashthi, Sumit Sengupta, the food & beverages manager at MPS Food Hub, told The Telegraph. Five chefs are doing what they do best to make the buffet special. One more chef from Calcutta will join us in a day or two. Thats to make sure that we have enough hands to meet the demands of a full house, Sengupta said, adding, Theres an a la carte option for people who may prefer particular dishes from the menu. Says executive chef Jitu Nath, who has had brief stints in Dubai and Mumbai, The dishes in the buffet have been prepared in authentic Bengali style, albeit the ones such as murgir jhol has been kept mild. Thats to make sure that those who like it a little less spicy can whet their appetite as well. The Puja ambience has already been created. The restaurant has been decorated with lal parer sari (symbolic of the Goddess), the sound of dhak reverberates from the sound system, and, of course, there is chandmala to welcome the guests. The value-for-money buffet apart, the prices tagged to the other delicacies are rock bottom, very much Calcutta-like. For instance, at the Kolkata roll counter, the chicken tikka roll comes for Rs 40, lamb sheekh roll for Rs 50 and egg roll for Rs 25. Then again, theres a full plate of chicken biryani for just Rs 90, mutton biryani for Rs 110, chicken chaap for Rs 50 and mutton rezala for Rs 65. At the snacks counter, a chicken pakora (large) comes for a pocket-friendly Rs 12, a decent sized chicken cutlet is priced Rs 28 while golden fried prawns comes for Rs 20 a piece. If thats not enough, those with a sweet tooth can have every reason to feel mishti. We will serve a special sandesh on Vijaya Dashami. Besides, at Blend N Brew, there is an array of Bengali sweets on offer. These are reasonably priced between Rs 5 and Rs 30. The one to look out for is the two-in-one rosogolla, which has chocolate on one side, for Rs 8 only. Then theres kheer kodom for Rs 5, mango rosogolla for Rs 6 and malai chom chom for Rs 10, the F&B manager said, adding. We are planning similar festivals ahead of Diwali, Bhai Phota and New Years Day as well."
303,Potato cultivatio​n dwindles this season in Nilgiris,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/Potato-cultivation-dwindles-this-season-in-Nilgiris/articleshow/16908754.cms,2012-10-22,The Times Of India,"UDHAGAMANDALAM: A recent study showing that potato cultivation has been dwindling in Nilgiris has prompted officials from the Horticulture Research Centre and Directorate of Marketing Intelligence Centre to initiate steps to encourage farmers to cultivate potato in the hill district.Potato is cultivated in the Nilgiris in about 1500 acres, every three months. However, farmers generally switch to other vegetables once the potato crop is harvested to maintain the soil standard. According to a survey conducted by the horticulture department, farmers preferred other crops like carrot which is an ideal cash crop. This is because of the risks involved in cultivating potato in the rainy season as it is vulnerable to changes in weather. The cost involved in cultivating carrot is less than that of potato. While it costs around Rs 65,000 to cultivate an acre with potato, it is only Rs 25,000 for cultivating carrot in an acre.N Selvaraj, President, Horticulture Research Centre said, ""This time the area of cultivation of potato has declined as farmers seem to prefer cash crops like carrot where the investment is low. Also, potato is vulnerable to climatic changes where excess rains and high humidity, expected this season, may affect yield"". Carrot seed are cheaply available. This is not the case with potato. Besides, seedlings sometimes need to be shipped from North India, which adds to the cost.The potato research centre in Ooty and the Horticulture Research centre produce potato seedling in their farms which are sold to farmers at a nominal price which is at least 30 percent less than the open market price. Currently, they have 10 tonnes of four varieties of seeds. Potato varieties like 'Kufrigiridari', 'Kufrijothi',' Kufrigiriraj' and 'Kufriswarna' are recommended by the horticulture research centre for cultivation as this autumn crop. ""This 'Kadai bogum' is a very important cultivation as its yield is the source of seedlings for the main crop in April and May,"" said Selvaraj. According to him, seeds procured from North India contain Aphids, a kind of virus, which affects yield.The Directorate of Marketing Intelligence Centre in TNAU has come out with a forecast for procurement price for potato this season. According to their analysis, the yield in December - January would fetch farmers Rs.20-22 per kg. This forecast is based on analysis of the selling price of potato in the Nilgiris Cooperative Marketing Society for the past 22 years.According to records, potato, an important food staple and the number one vegetable crop in the world, was cultivated in 18.10 lakh hectares in India during 2011-12 and the production amounted to 413 lakh tonnes. According to National Horticulture Research and Development Commission, in Tamil Nadu, about 62,940 tonnes of potato was produced in an area of 2,950 hectares during 2011-12."

The price of vegetables have also gone up considerably, putting up additional financial burden on the people.Fine variety rice per kilo costs around costs around Rs.35 in the open market. Super fine variety is priced at Rs.40. Black gram is sold at Rs.80 per kilo and same is the case with Bengal gram which is mostly used for the preparation of sweets. Yellow lentils, popularly known as toor dal is being sold at Rs.86. Prices of almost all varieties have gone up 15 to 20 per cent compared to last year.There is no respite with the oil prices. Sun flower oil is costing around Rs.88 per litre. Rates of vegetables which came down during rainy season are also again skyrocketing.Rate of potatoes has increased from Rs.15 to Rs.18 per kilo with the heavy demand in Dasara season. All vegetables including brinjal, cabbage, carrot and others are available only above Rs.20 per kilo.People blamed the government for the current scenario. Traders also raised their voice against the government for the skyrocketing of prices after the upward revision of diesel prices. Transportation of essential goods has become very expensive after the government enhanced the diesel rates. But the consumers blame the traders for the skyrocketing of prices in the market said M. Kameswara Rao, a trader of Potti Sriramulu market.Women consumers are up in arms against the government policies. Supply of only six LPG refills on subsidy rate has caused uproar among them.We are scared to invite even close family members for Dasara celebrations. It is very difficult to lead the life with the upward revision of electricity, gas bills. The government should take steps to stabilise rates of essential commodities, K. Pavani, a consumer."
305,Did tough stance against RIL lead to Jaipal Reddy’s exit from petroleum ministry?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Did-tough-stance-against-RIL-lead-to-Jaipal-Reddys-exit-from-petroleum-ministry/articleshow/17011502.cms,2012-10-30,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Former petroleum minister Jaipal Reddy's ouster was possibly set in motion by a tough note he wrote stating that if demands put forward by Reliance Industries Ltd were accepted, the loss to government would amount to $6.2 billion.Reddy's note, sent to attorney general Goolam Vahanvati, is believed to have set the cat among the pigeons in government with some viewing the communication as politically explosive. The minister was repeatedly advised to reconsider his view on the matter, sources close to him said.The minister's differences with RIL are widely seen to be the reason for his being moved to the science and technology portfolio although other arguments put forward include Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's concern over disputes locking gas supplies to industry.In his clash with the petrochemical giant, Reddy took the view that RIL was ""hoarding"" gas by slowing production in its offshore fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin. This, the oil ministry felt, caused a loss of Rs 40,000 crore to companies in the current year while it was Rs 20,000 crore last year.Reddy did not buy the ""geological"" reasons put forward by RIL to explain the slow extraction of gas and read these arguments as part of tactics to force the government to accept a revision in the price of gas. He made it clear that he would not favour any revision till 2014.The minister's critics argued that Reddy's showdown with RIL was bottling up gas supplies at a time when UPA desperately needs the wheels of the economy to spin faster. As the power sector became a political hot potato in the wake of a massive national shutdown in July and Coalgate added to the public fury, RIL's case began to gain traction.Sources said Reddy's note elicited a ""wishy-washy"" response from the attorney general as the government sought to resolve the standoff. The minister was, however, in no mood to relent and felt the government should not accept the tab for what amounted to a bailout for RIL.The ministry calculated an increase in the price of gas would cost the government billions of dollars and raise uncomfortable questions about selective action. This at a time when transparency activists and opposition parties were going hammer and tongs against the corruption scandals ranging from 2G to Coalgate.The minister is understood to have reasoned that his views could always be overturned or amended, keeping in mind any larger interest the government felt was relevant. However, the government's cause was unlikely to be served by suitably compliant notings, he felt.Having rubbed influential interests the wrong way and failing to take broad hints led to Reddy's charge being abruptly changed. This considerably tarnished an otherwise well-thought out reshuffle with even several Congress leaders agreeing that Reddy was treated rather shabbily."
306,State cold storages threaten strike,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/State-cold-storages-threaten-strike/articleshow/17082276.cms,2012-11-04,The Times Of India,"HOOGHLY: With potatoes from Punjab expected to reach Bengal only in December, state cold-storage owners are planning to make use of the projected supply crunch from mid-November. They have threatened to go on a one-day strike on November 19 unless the government revises the storage rental that has remained unchanged despite the hike in diesel prices and electricity charges.The strike threat is likely to have a temporary impact in city markets, which might give an excuse to retailers for increasing potato prices by 25 paise or 50 paise a kg. Owners of the 422 storages chose November to go on the warpath because the retail market depends solely on supply from the state cold storages during this month. According to a cold-storage owner, a total 3.5 lakh potato packets (each weighing 50 kg) are cleared from the cold storages on a daily basis.The dearth of supply during a strike will disturb the flow of potatoes in the retail market.""Electricity charges for storing 1 quintal of potato have increased by Rs 19. Even handling charges for the same quantity has gone up from Rs 2.40 to Rs 3. But the rental remains at Rs 101 per quintal. We want the government to address our problems, otherwise we will go on a strike,"" said storage owners' spokesperson Patit Paban De. Storage owners have timed the stir on November 19 as their annual rental agreement with the state agricultural department expires on November 15.However, De didn't mention that storage owners are still making a profit of Rs 150 per quintal. They are trying to hold on to the stored potato expecting a rise in potato prices in the days to come. Why so? Potato cultivation has been delayed by a week this year due to untimely rain. In absence of supply from other states, potato growers are taking their stored potato in intsallments to get better price in a bid to offset the rising input costs. Cold storage owners now want a percentage of the profit pie. They now want the government to hike the storage rental to Rs 151 a quintal.However, storage owners argue that such hike in storage rentals is nothing special. ""It happened during the Left Front regime. I don't see why this government won't accept our demand,"" a storage owner said. Storage owners hope that the government will respond favourably in view of the coming panchayat polls where the potato growers will play a crucial role."

So it is difficult to keep the prices of namkeens steady,"" said the owner of a bakery in Mapusa.The sudden rise in price of namkeens is a matter of great concern to the bakeries selling these products.""These products are bought by Goans and with the current rise in prices, these have become unaffordable for many locals. Companies making branded products can survive such a price rise, but it can be fatal for the unorganised sector,"" said Gajanan Golaskar, the owner of a bakery in Panaji.Making these local snacks and selling them in the market is a source of income to several women's self-help groups and if the sales are affected due to the hiked prices, the business of making namkeens may become unsustainable for these women affecting their source of income and even livelihood in many cases.With the festival of Diwali just round the corner, the increase in prices has left both the makers of the products and the buyers worried.""The prices are going to affect the locals as their expenditure during the Diwali festival will increase,"" said Vishal Palyekar, a resident of Tivim who is gearing to celebrate the festival of lights.""The increase in the price of fuel is indirectly affecting the cost of commodities used to make these snacks.

""The rates of the ingredients used in these products had been constant for quite some time. But they suddenly increased within a span of a few months. The government should stabilize the prices of atleast these ingredients that go in the making of namkeens in the interest of local sellers and buyers,"" he said.A self-help group in Panaji said that they make up to 50% more profits during Diwali from the sale of chaklis and chivda as against regular sales. But, this year, the profits will come down hugely as locals are reducing the quantity of orders for the festival.""The branded products already provide tough competition to these local namkeens as they have the big money to advertise their brands. The rise in prices will only mar the business of the local industry further. It is not the fault of the local makers of namkeens as even they have to look at their interest and can't run the business at a loss,"" said Rishi Jalan, a student.An official from the commercial tax department said that taxes on branded snacks have been increased from 5% to 20% while taxes on the local snacks remain unchanged. This should have helped local snacks to up their sales, but the increase in prices of ingredients of namkeens have kept local businesses from cashing in on this opportunity."
309,Dhaka seeks access to  farm market,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1121112/jsp/business/story_16186419.jsp,2012-11-12,Telegraph,"Reaping benefits New Delhi, Nov. 11: Bangladesh is looking to sell its surplus farm produce to India, one of Asias biggest buyers. The eastern neighbour wants to take advantage of new trade benefits to sell its surplus potatoes, vegetables and flowers, Matia Chowdhury, Bangladeshs agriculture minister, told The Telegraph. Bangladesh produces about 8 million tonnes of potatoes, 3 million tonnes of vegetables and 4,000 tonnes of major flowers. Nearly a third of the countrys vegetables perish as does a sixth of its potato crop, while lack of storage forces growers to often sell flowers at one-tenth of the price in India. An agriculture export thrust will be made the government can act as a catalyst actual sales will have to be through private traders, said Chowdhury, who was in India at the invitation of the Indian government to discuss farm co-operation, river water sharing and bilateral political relations. Bangladesh, which till recently imported rice from India, is now self-sufficient with production likely to touch 32 million tonnes by the end of this year. Though India produces about 17 per cent of the worlds vegetables, rising income and changes in food demand pattern have led to shortages, pushing up prices by 15-50 per cent. Analysts say farm supply from western Bangladesh to nearby markets in Calcutta and even further west in Delhi or Mumbai can benefit both countries. New rules notified last year lets Indias neighbours Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives sell goods  where local value addition is over 40 per cent  free of duty to the $1.7-trillion market. The rules do not apply for except liquor, wine and tobacco. Indias two-way trade with Bangladesh is about $5 billion, but with a surplus of $4.5 billion in favour of India. Sujay Nag, former country head of Tata International in Bangladesh, said, In western Bangladesh, large quantities of green vegetables, fish and flowers are thrown away as there arent enough buyers tuberose sells for Rs 4 a dozen there, while it sells for Rs 24 a dozen in Calcutta, which is just 80-90km from the flower growing centre of Jessore. Natural markets and hinterland for farm produce which were disturbed by partition can be reunited by encouraging this trade, said Nag. Tech support The Bangladesh delegation, led by Chowdhury, also negotiated deals to get drought resistant and saline tolerant foodgrain seed technology from India. Chowdhury also said Bangladesh was open to the idea of foreign direct investment in food-processing. India has invested about $600 million in its neighbour. More big-ticket investments are in the pipeline, such as in power. NTPC has signed deals which can bring in $1.5 billion into Bangladesh. Indias Marico has plans to invest about Rs 30-40 crore in personal care and food processing."

314,Chill of hike freeze,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1121117/jsp/bengal/story_16204979.jsp,2012-11-17,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Nov. 16: Owners of potato cold storages today announced a days shutdown on Monday and threatened a longer agitation to protest the Mamata Banerjee governments refusal to allow a rent hike. Many officials termed this as another instance of the populist governments reluctance to raise tariffs. The rent is our only source of income. Overhead costs have spiralled in the past two years. But the government is not allowing us to increase the rent. We are incurring heavy losses, said Rampada Pal, the chairman of a joint committee under which cold storage unions have united to protest the governments refusal to increase rent. Mondays cessation of work is just symbolic. If this continues, we will be forced to close down our operations to cut losses, he added. Potato cold storage charges are Rs 101 per quintal in south Bengal and Rs 109 per quintal in north Bengal. In other states, the rates are between Rs 150 and Rs 200 per quintal. We want the government to raise charges to Rs 150 in south Bengal and Rs 158 in north Bengal, Pal said. The committee submitted a deputation to agriculture marketing minister Arup Roy on Wednesday after repeated pleas to consider the problem fell on deaf ears. Roy said he was aware of the situation. The matter is being considered and something will be done soon. Since the new government came to power, it has not allowed the 425 facilities specialising in potato storage to charge more for their services. Cold storage units provide crucial backup in the production and trade of potato by absorbing the surplus harvest between January and March every year, officials in the agricultural marketing department said. Approximately, a third of the states total potato output of around 85 lakh tonnes is stored in the facilities in the last quarter of every financial year for round-the-year sale. The units also store seeds. The 425 units handle around 122 tonnes of potato daily. Bengal is the second-largest producer of potato in the country after Uttar Pradesh. According to Writers sources, the main reason for the refusal to hike rent is the chief ministers stand against burdening farmers. Her stand on this is similar to that on increase in transport fares and power tariff. This government keeps looking away from economic realities till the last minute, citing populist reasons, only to yield when there is a crisis, an official said. According to him, only 10 per cent of potato farmers in Bengal can afford cold storage facilities. Middlemen mostly use the cold storages. By refusing to allow a rent hike, the government is effectively helping the middlemen, he added. According to sources in the government, Bengal and Tripura are the only states in India where the administration controls cold storage rent. The last rent hike in Bengal was allowed in 2010 during the Left Front rule. It had been raised by Rs 39. The sources said the chief minister would take a call on the hike demand. According to them, work on revising rent cannot begin till an expert committee of officials of the agricultural marketing and agriculture departments and representatives of cold storage owners unions is set up. An expert committee is constituted every year to assess costs and expenses and recommend charge revisions. This government is yet to set up such a committee. The committee needs around six months to submit its recommendations, an official said. Asked if the panel would be set up, minister Roy said: Yes. I cannot tell you when, but it will be done."

Shailesh Kapoor of Ormax Media said, ""If the bandh continues till Tuesday, the loss could total Rs 13 crore. If the rest of Maharashtra is affected too, it may rise to Rs 17-18 crore.'' The television industry, too, is on tenterhooks about meeting deadlines for submitting episodes to channels. Producers fear they may be forced to telecast reruns.Khar resident Sunita Salaskar (75) had a cataract operation at KEM Hospital on Sunday morning. But this did not stop her from reaching Shivaji Park for the funeral wearing dark glasses. Her husband Jagannath (77), who suffers from partial paralysis, accompanied her. ""He was our voice,"" Salaskar said. Like them, scores of seniors came to bid farewell to Balasaheb. Amruta Mistry (50) said it feels unreal that he is no more. ""Without him, Dusshera rallies will not be the same."" Veterinary doctor S D Sanil said Balasaheb was unlike any other leader. And Saraswati Pankal (80), a househelp, had travelled all the way from Sawantwadi.Once a close associate of Balasaheb in the Shiv Sena, Congress MP Sanjay Nirupam will dedicate Monday's Chhat Puja at Juhu beach to his former mentor. ""We will put up a big picture of him on the dias and pray that his soul attains everlasting peace. Irrespective of party politics, I do believe that the passing of Balasaheb is a great loss to us all. We will curtail festivities by merely performing the rituals. We will dispense with planned performances by Sonu Nigam and the Maithili singers who sing Chhat songs to mark the festival,"" Nirupam said.As most of the city's roads wore a deserted look, the few commuters, whether in trains, buses or private cars, had a smooth commute. But what they savoured the most was ""free access'' into the city as the toll nakas were unmanned. Best of all, the swanky and expensive sea link, too, was free to drive on. For once, travelling in Greater Mumbai was indeed seamless and cost little.The turnout for Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray's last journey was mega, and so was the religious ceremony. Five priests from the Siddhivinayak temple had been called in to perform the funeral rites. The first-ever public cremation at Shivaji Park also had another special touch-only sandalwood was used for the pyre.The best obituary for the late Shiv Sena chief came from none other than his grandson, Aditya. ""Balasaheb is in every Shiv Sainik, every person who follows his thoughts and actions of helping everyone selflessly,'' he wrote on a social networking site. The familial touch followed. ""To me, of course, he has been a grandfather more than anything else, with me asking him or throwing tantrums for almost everything, and he did it for me.'' The young leader then thanked everyone.There were two unknown faces in the funeral procession. A senior Shiv Sena leader said they were male nurses Darsheel and Vijay who work with Leelavati Hospital. Ever since Senior Thackeray was admitted to the hospital in July, they had looked after him. They continued to care for him at his home as well. Both were surprised when members of the Thackeray family asked them to join the funeral procession. When Uddhav was performing the last rites, he asked them to join him there as well. Balasaheb's doctors Jalil Parkar and Prakash Jiandani, too, were part of the cortege.When chief minister Prithviraj Chavan realized that security at Shivaji Park would be burdened, considering more than half a dozen cabinet members were to reach the venue for the funeral, he personally spoke to all of them and asked them to assemble at Varsha, his official residence. It was felt that they should travel together. Accordingly, they travelled in just two cars.Mumbai's spirit of giving was on display yet again. At Dadar, a shop owner was distributing biscuit packets to people walking towards Shivaji Park. Nearly 45 families of the erstwhile Kelkar Wadi Chawl near Shivaji Mandir en route to Shivaji Park were hard at work. The families, part of Abhinav Krida Mandal, were peeling, chopping, cooking all day. They filled up 15 water drums, each of 100-litre capacity. With the city shut, others started chipping in. Nearby traders sent in 50kg sacks of pohe. More sacks were brought in from Vashi and Lalbaug. Around 500 litres of milk was organized by Jagdish Milk vendor. ""By evening, over 1,500kg pohe and 1,000 litres of milk besides 40 kg each of onion and potatoes were used up to make hot poha and tea,'' said a college girl. Ashirvad Decorators lent the drums and three tankers were called in.As the sun shone brightly on Sunday, Shiv Sainiks who had gathered at Shivaji Park were predictably struggling for water. With no shops to buy water bottles from, people used innovative-if desperate-measures to quench their thirst. They rushed to a water tanker parked outside the park. Some drank directly from the tanker's tap. There were queues for other items as well: 100 people were standing to take tea at a stall put up by an RPI member."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Nov. 21: Potato and onion soup for dinner? How tempting. But the cost might sour the taste. Potato, which sold between Rs 13 and 14 a kilo, is now selling for Rs 16 to 17. The price of onion, which used to be sold for around Rs 15-16, has climbed by around Rs 3 a kilo. Since potato and onion are essential ingredients for most dishes, we are feeling the pinch of the rise in their prices, said Patitpaban Sahoo, a resident of the city. The price of vegetables has gone up this month because of the increase in demand. People of the state generally observe the auspicious Kartik month (mid-October to mid-November) and avoid eating non-vegetarian food. The holy month will end next week. Some traders blamed the increase in price on the excessive dependence on other states to meet the demand for potato and onion. We import potato from Bengal and the price of potato has increased there since Tuesday. Consequently, it has risen here as well, said general secretary of Rajdhani Dainik Haat Byabasayi Mahasangh of Unit-I Daily Market Gayadhar Swain. Sources said that though Odishas potato demand stands at five lakh tonnes a year, the state is only able to produce between 1.75 and 1.8 lakh tonnes. So, the state has to depend on Bengal for this important vegetable. The citys requirement stands at 500 tonnes a day. For onion, the state is heavily dependant on Nasik. But traders of the city said the onion from Nasik is yet to come to the state. At present, Odisha is depending on Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to meet its demand of onion. However, the recent cyclone in southern India has affected onion production. Onion from Nasik will arrive in the second week of December and the price of onion will remain high till then, said Parshuram Sahoo, an onion trader. The city needs between 150 and 200 tonnes of onion on a daily basis. Consumers will have to wait for another one month for the prices to fall because locally-grown potato and onion is expected to hit the markets by then. A section of traders blamed the state government for not having an effective system to control the market price of these commodities along with lack of storage facilities . All the potato stocks in various storage points are almost finished. Retailers take advantage because the state government does not keep tabs on price rise, said secretary of Kuberapuri Merchants Association, Sakti Mishra."

Nielsen data also shows that PepsiCo Foods' ( FritoLay India) share in overall western snacks has slipped to 40% last fiscal from 48% in 2009-10.A PepsiCo spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on market shares, which ""fluctuate from quarter to quarter"".""This year we have further strengthened our market position in all potato chips, Kurkure, baked snacks and traditional namkeen that we operate in, with more than 25 new launches including new category introductions like Kurkure Monster Paws and Kurkure Puffcorn,"" the person said.Officials said the firm is banking on volumes, multiple packs and increased marketing spends to get back its market share.But then its smaller rivals too are widening their product portfolio and reach.DFM Foods, maker of Crax snacks, for example, stepped up its distribution in North India and launched Crax in the western markets last summer. ""This has helped in our brand share going up,"" Mohit Satyanand, independent director at DFM Foods, said.The salted snacks market in the country has been growing 25% a year, and smaller players have been fuelling category growth as much as bigger ones like PepsiCo, ITC and Haldiram's.And they are attracting the attention of private equity players. Mid last year, Sequoia Capital invested close to $30 million in Indore-based snack food maker Prakash Snacks, owner of Yellow Diamond chips. The eight-year-old Indore-based firm sells a range of chips and savoury puffs.PepsiCo has been selling products at prices ranging from Rs 2 to Rs 55 across categories. Last year, it consolidated its mass-priced snacks under a new entity, Lehar Foods, to take on regional brands such as Balaji, Bikanervala and A-Top Foods.It operates on a low-cost model and PepsiCo is hopeful that Lehar Foods will contribute 50% to the firm's foods division FritoLay by 2015. A couple of years back, PepsiCo attempted to buy out strong regional players such as Gujarat-based Balaji Wafers and A-Top Foods, but the talks did not materialise.Meanwhile, the competition is increasing. Biscuits and snacks maker Parle Products extended its portfolio to the traditional salted snacks category with the revamp of its 'Parle namkeens' earlier this month.""Whenever new products enter any category, the dominant player naturally gets impacted,"" B Krishna Rao, group product manager at Parle Products, said. He said the company was enthused by the product's initial response and hoped to capture 20% share by the end of this fiscal."

325,Veggie prices soar as strike enters day 4,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Veggie-prices-soar-as-strike-enters-day-4/articleshow/17472338.cms,2012-12-04,The Times Of India,"PUNE: Retail prices of some vegetables almost doubled on the third day of the indefinite strike of commission agents. Prices have gone up by 80% to 100%, though the price fluctuation in the wholesale market was within normal range and the supply had increased marginally.The wholesale market received 3,822 quintals of fruit vegetables, 625 quintals of fruits and 907 quintals of leafy vegetables.Commission agents at the wholesale market are on an indefinite strike since December 1 against the state marketing department's decision to have a flat commission rate of 6% on every transaction made in the agriculture produce market committees across the state. The agents in the Pune market so far charged anything in the range of 6% to 10% per transaction.Brinjal prices which were close to Rs 30 per kg last week, had gone up to Rs 60 per kg on Monday. The retail markets closer to the wholesale market did not register significantly higher prices but retailers located some distance away such as in places like Narayan Peth, Mahatma Phule mandai, Deccan Gymkhana and Model colony markets had higher prices for fruit vegetables, leafy vegetables and fruits as well.Unlike leafy vegetables, potato is supplied to Pune from Agra wholesale market and other fruit vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower and gourds are supplied from locations away from the city. The price increase is higher in fruit vegetables than leafy vegetables.A bunch of spinach, fenugreek or coriander was sold for Rs 8 to Rs 16 in the retail market, but the basic price for fruit vegetables started at Rs 30 per kg.Subhash Pawar, a vegetable vendor at the Mandai, was selling a bunch of spinach and fenugreek at Rs 15 each which was sold at Rs 8 per bunch last week. Cauliflower and cabbage were sold at Rs 30 and Rs 40 per kg respectively when the prices of the same were Rs 15 and Rs 30 last week.Pawar said, ""The ongoing strike of agents has reduced the supply to the wholesale market. There are too many vendors so we had to pay more for the produce; hence we are selling it at a higher price. Leafy vegetables are supplied from nearby places and also have short shelf life which also keeps their price low.""The same produce in the wholesale market did not carry higher price as the retail vendors claimed. Ten bunches of spinach and fenugreek were sold for Rs 50 in the wholesale market. The same was sold at Rs 40 last week. The cabbage and cauliflower fetched price around Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500 per quintal (Rs 20-25 per kg) in the wholesale market on Monday, which is almost the same as last week.Rama Jawle, a housewife and a regular at the Narayan Peth vegetable market, said, ""I think the prices have been increased artificially. I have to change my plans and postponed some planned expenses in the house as such high prices have disturbed my monthly plans. If the strike continues, I will have to go to the wholesale market and buy vegetables.""The agriculture produce market committee (APMC), popularly known as Gultekdi Market Yard, on a normal day, receives supply of about 11 tonne of all types of vegetables and fruits. Around 60% of it is supplied to other district places and smaller wholesale markets. As per the officials from the agriculture produce market committee administration, it is not yet clear how much produce was actually consumed in the city as there were many vegetable suppliers from the fringe areas who directly sell to customers or to local retail vendors, said a senior officer at the market committee.Shivlal Bhosale, chairman of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Commission Agents Association at the APMC said, ""The association has contacted state marketing minister and other officials about our strike. This is disappointing that when prices and charges of various services are going up; our commission rate is not revised since 1991. Agents have to borrow money to sustain in the business as we need to have some financial support. Bringing down commission is not going to benefit anyone but will discourage the agents from doing this business."""

The sugar mills are erring on the payment of Rs 120 crore to sugarcane farmers. Chauhan said production cost of sugarcane has risen by around 25%. ""Not only sugarcane even potato crops are crucial for UP farmers who look up to the state government for a fair price for their produce. But that does not seem to happen in this government,'' he said."
327,"Death for small business, says BJP",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/296302/death-small-business-says-bjp.html,2012-12-04,Deccan Herald,"Death for small business, says BJPNEW DELHI, Dec 4, 2012, DHNS: 1:54 ISTFDI in retail: Samajwadi Party chief sings along with opposition partiesUnited Progressive Alliance ally Samajwadi Party joined opposition parties on Tuesday in attacking the government for allowing 51 per cent FDI in retail sector.Initiating the politically sensitive debate in Parliament on Tuesday afternoon, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj quoted global studies and the experience of foreign countries to drive the point home that opening up of this sector will not promote employment but decimate neighbourhood shops, impoverish small farmers besides hurting consumers.She appealed to parties like the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the DMK to support the motion moved by her and CPMs Khagen Das against 51 per cent FDI in multi-brand retail. She allayed their fears that any defeat during the vote which will follow the debate taking place under rule 184 will not bring down the government but force them to rollback the decision on FDI.SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, whose support to the UPA is crucial to ensure the vote against them is defeated, opposed FDI on the ground that it was not in favour of the nation. Had Gandhiji and Lohia were alive, they would not allow FDI in retail, the veteran leader said in his brief speech.But, Yadav hinted at continuing support to the UPA government but may abstain from voting on Wednesday.Swaraj drew an ironical situation by stating that US president Barak Obama is promoting small businesses concept which is equivalent of countrys weekly bazaars that provides market to poor traders for selling their products at cheap prices benefiting consumers.In this years budget, the US government had listed a ten-point formula to promote small business as they believe that it is the engine of job growth, she pointed out in her 90-minute speech with facts, data and sarcasm. The speech disrupted by heated exchanges between the two benches. The BJP leaders also referred to a 2008 European Union Parliament report to substantiate their fears that competition is always in the interest of the consumer and monopoly is not.She said the report highlighted the fact that the farmers, including in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland,and Hungary were agitating against giant retailers since they were squeezing profit margins while buying products from them. They indulged in predatory pricing by initially selling products at lower prices to kill competition but after the consumers get accustomed they jack up the rates. At the end the consumers have little choice, she remarked.Picking loopholes in the government commitment that FDI in retail will generate 40 lakh jobs in the country, she remarked that it is not feasible as the policy is supposed to be implemented in only 51 districts having population of 10 lakh and more. To generate such huge volume of jobs, 36,000 stores have to be opened, which would mean that 600 stores in one districts. In comparison, Walmart has 9,826 stores globally employing only 21 lakh persons. Carrefour has 30 stores and 15,937 employees only.Swaraj also quoted Punjabs example saying Pepsi promised to buy potatoes and tomatoes from farmers, but backed out later. She also asserted that her party was not opposed to FDI per se and offered to travel with the prime minister across the world to invite investments in other sectors like infrastructure."
328,Cold truth of storage units,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1121205/jsp/bihar/story_16274376.jsp,2012-12-05,Telegraph,"The closed-down Saraf Cold Storage. Picture by Sachin Patna, Dec. 4: The backbone of the food processing industry, cold storage units, is weakening in the state when international food chains such as KFC and Pizza Hut are setting up shops in the capital. According to state government records, ten of the 35 cold storage units in the city are non-functional for over a decade. Members of Cold Storage Owners Association, Bihar, however, claimed that only seven units were functional and four more had shut down this year. A city with over 20 lakh population needs around 50 cold storages with a total capacity of around 2,50,000 tonnes. The city has no such luck, though. With its 18 lakh-plus population, the seven functional cold storages have an estimated capacity of only 35,000 metric tonnes. Decades-old cold storages have shut down allegedly because of perennial power crisis and lack of subsidy. The owner of a 53-year-old cold storage at Digha that closed down this year told The Telegraph: Electricity tariff was hiked numerous times with retrospective effect over the past two to three years. Being one of the oldest units in the state, we were using comparatively old technology. It required higher and uninterrupted electricity supply, which was not available. Accordingly, there was a steep rise in the expenditure while our capacity remained the same. We were almost on the verge of bankruptcy and decided to close down. Madan Kumar, the owner of Saraf Cold Storage in Lodi Katra, Patna City, had a similar story to tell. His cold storage unit with a capacity of 2,450 tonnes was set up in March 1997. Mostly used for potato storage, the unit closed down last year. He said: We started suffering heavy losses, mainly because of repeated hikes in fuel surcharge. Finally, we had to close it, he said. According to the records of the directorate of horticulture, there are 330 registered cold storages in the state. One hundred of them have been listed as non-functional for over a decade. S.N. Ashraf, the secretary of Cold Storage Owners Association, Bihar, said: The records of the horticulture directorate are obsolete. They have also included several small ice cream-making units in the list of cold storages. Lamenting that running cold storages is no longer financially feasible, he said: Recent studies state that about one-third of the horticultural produce, especially fruits and vegetables, is damaged because of poor cold storage facilities. With regard to its establishment cost, a cold storage unit with a capacity of around 4,000 metric tonnes can be set up at a cost of around Rs 2 crore. Arvinder Singh, director, directorate of horticulture, agreed the business was no longer viable but added that Bihar was not the only sufferer. Cold storage is no more a viable business not only in Bihar but in other parts of the country as well. It is in consideration of its low profitability that the Government of India provides 40 per cent capital subsidy for setting up cold storages, which is the highest rate of subsidy given under any of the government schemes. The business model of cold storage is faulty, as recovering capital cost through rent is not at all feasible, he said."

PHOTO: PTI/ TV GRABCountering the Opposition attack in the Lok Sabha on FDI in multi-brand retail, Information Technology and Communications Minister Kapil Sibal defended the governments claim that FDI would result in increasing productive capacity, upgrading of technology and creation of employment opportunities.Accusing the main Opposition party, the BJP, of unnecessarily politicising the FDI issue, Mr. Sibal said the party had opposed liberalisation but supported the same policies when it led the NDAs coalition government at the Centre.The BJPs claim on FDI is vastly exaggerated. We are not enforcing the FDI decision. It is only for the willing States to implement it. The ultimate choice rests with the States, Mr. Sibal said.As ruling party members thumped their desks in glee over his counter-arguments, Mr. Sibal said the BJPs 2004 poll manifesto promised FDI in multi-brand retail but wondered why it is opposing it today.Mr. Sibal said that as per the FDI policy, only 18 cities in the country could have such stores. He also allayed the apprehension voiced by BJP leader Sushma Swaraj that big retail giants would ruin small traders in India: Walmart took 16 years in China to turn profitable.Citing the example of West Bengal, Mr. Sibal said multinational giants such as Pepsico were purchasing potatoes from farmers in the State since 2010 as per the pre-agreed pricing agreement. He said the demand in West Bengal for potatoes by Pepsico had gone up from 22,000 tonnes last year to 60,000 tonnes and the cultivated area had also increased from 5,500 acres to 7,000 acres.Mr. Sibal said India was the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world, with production touching 200 million tonnes annually, of which nearly 80 million tonnes went waste as there were not enough big retail chains to buy the produce from farmers who would stand to gain by way of remunerative prices.Sure buyersThe purpose of the FDI policy is that the farmer should get higher price than the market price for his produce. A farmer has to negotiate with eight commission agents or middlemen till he reaches the market, this policy will cut down all that. Their produce will not go waste and they will get sure buyers. Are you with the farmers or with the middlemen and commission agents, he asked the Opposition.Mr. Sibal said the urban population in the country would go up from 340 million to 4,654 million by 2020 and there would be a pressing need for jobs for the youth. The manufacturing sector is now looking up in India as wages here are low and efficiency higher as compared to China. FDI infusion will create jobs in the manufacturing sector.Turning to the Left parties, Mr. Sibal said: You are multi-brand party, adding that countries such as China, Russia and Chile had allowed 100 per cent FDI.His counter-attack, though interrupted often by Opposition members, drew cheers from the ruling party members when he said India had made giant strides in the component industry in the automobile sector and pharmaceuticals. Today the top three pharma companies are from India and without our components no car can be manufactured, he said. All through his defence, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi were present in the Lok Sabha.Farmers will get high price, more jobs will be createdOnly the willing States need implement it: Sibal"

(Hardeep Singh) Anxiety eased into smiles as the high court played saviour, bailing Jharkhand out of a man-made black hole that lasted for almost 48 hours before the JSEB employees strike was called off on Friday morning. Like every other power board command area in the state, residents of capital Ranchi too suffered no less an ordeal. But, for some, like the Nags of Kantatolis Netaji Nagar Colony, the hassle quotient was a tad too high because guests came calling. My elder son Shankhadeep and daughter-in-law Smriti turned up from Dhanbad early yesterday (Thursday). Their visit was scheduled and we had never thought the power cut would last so long. Else, we could have asked them to postpone their trip. It was only after newspapers landed on our doorstep that we realised what we were up against, said homemaker Purnima Devi, whose husband N.C. Modak Nag is an employee of Food Corporation of India (FCI) in Ranchi. The Nags  the elderly couple and their younger son  live on the ground floor of their two-storied home, while the top floor is rented. No power since Wednesday midnight meant dry toilet taps and no drinking water in the kitchen. Though both families have separate tanks, the stored water wasnt enough for daily chores, cooking or even drinking. With two more people coming in, you can well imagine the hassle, Purnima said. For the men in the family, wet towels and deodorants were consolation in bath crisis. Fortunately, it is winter. You can afford to skip shower for a day, change clothes, spray some deo or perfume and head for office. We then freshened up at our respective offices. My wife and daughter-in-law, on the other hand, bought two 20-litre cans of water for emergency use, said the FCI official. With no power to run the geyser, the two women at home also had to warm up buckets of water in the sun on the terrace. Warming water on LPG is not an option anymore because cylinders have been rationed, the homemaker said. Purnima added that she had to rejig the days menu too. We, Bengalis, love to eat and go for lavish spreads irrespective of occasions. But with no water and electricity, you cant plan anything. So, for breakfast, I simply boiled eggs and served them with bread and butter. Lunch was puffed rice (muri) with boiled potatoes and tomatoes garnished with green chillies. As the crisis deepened by dusk on Thursday, the Nags and a couple of other households in Netaji Nagar Colony decided to pool in money and hire a generator. The idea was to use it for a few hours to run water pumps and fill up overhead tanks. But, getting a generator is no cakewalk when more than half of the state is groping in the dark. Most generator sets had been hired by restaurant owners and nursing homes. After scouting for one at several places, we managed to get hold of one at almost double the price than the normal rate of Rs 2,000 for five hours. The price of candles too had soared, said 30-year-old Shankhadeep Nag, the couples elder son who runs an English coaching institute in Dhanbad. But then, they say, all is well that ends well. Power was restored at Netaji Nagar Colony around 11.30am on Friday."
335,Tribals decide to take power in own hands,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/Tribals-decide-to-take-power-in-own-hands/articleshow/17592740.cms,2012-12-13,The Times Of India,"SHIMLA: In early 1960s, tribals in Lahaul-Spiti district had turned their fortunes by forming Lahaul Potato Growers Society (LPS), which was at one time the second largest cooperative society in Asia after Amul. Five decades later, tribals are again set to script a new chapter, venturing into hydro power generation through the cooperative movement, by forming Chandra Valley Hydro Power Project Cooperative Society Ltd with 800 members.Located beyond the 13,050-feet mighty Rohtang pass, tribals here are known for their entrepreneurial skills and hard labour. Through LPS, they not only changed their fortunes, but have also ventured into hotel business and food processing. With big companies venturing into hydel projects, they also jumped in. Knowing that financial constraints can stop their march, they formed the cooperative society to take care of finances.With members hailing from 30 villages of Chandra valley, stretching between Khoksar and Dalang villages, the society is perhaps the first such tribal initiative in the country. Formed five years back, the society plans to submit a detailed project report to state government for their dream venture of hydro power project. Two days back, director, energy, has sought some clarifications on the detailed project report, indicating project is under due consideration.""We had formed the society in 2007. It took us five years to prepare a detailed project report as, during the initial two years, we were not allocated any site. Now, we have submitted the detailed project report for 2.5 MW hydro power project in Khoksar and our case is being scrutinized,"" said Balbir Singh Yarki, managing director of the society.Yarki said that the project would cost around Rs 16 crore. ""Initially, we have collected Rs 11,400 from each member, which comes to around Rs 1 crore. We will raise more funds besides taking loan from banks,"" he said. Power generated from the project will be sold to Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board through an agreement to be signed before the execution of the project, he said.Once the project is cleared, they would hire a consultant for execution of the project. ""Many engineers from our own Chandra valley have assured to guide us from time to time and we would certainly take their help,"" he added.Yarki, a former block development officer and a native of Lahaul valley, is credited with encouraging villagers to set up cooperatives to run micro hydro power projects. Though the response was low initially, Yarki's efforts worked and today Chandra society is the second largest cooperative after the Lahaul Potato Growers Society.Chairman of Chandra society, Lal Chand Katoch, said, ""Big companies are coming to Lahaul to explore the hydro power potential. Instead of opposing the projects, people should become part of the development process. We have identified three potential sites with 400 KV to 5 MW capacity, where we would set up projects. We cannot compete with big companies individually, but through cooperative societies, we definitely can,"" he said.With a population density of 2 persons per sq km, Lahaul-Spiti district, at an altitude of 10,050 feet, has India's lowest population density. Its population is around 32,000 while the total geographical area is 13,833 sq km.Around 158 years back, Moravian Missionaries had first introduced cultivation of seed potato at Gumrang village. Later, on May 28, 1966, tribals formed Lahaul Potato Growers Society (LPS), which has now diversified into hotel and food processing business. LPS also runs a petrol pump at Tandi and an LPG agency.The tribals here have also formed Lahaul Hops and Chikori Cooperative Society, which has around 1,200 farmers as registered members. They have now formed Lahaul-Spiti Seabuckthorn Cooperative Marketing Society to ensure profitable marketing of seabuckthorn."

Data released by the commerce ministry on Friday showed inflation rate, as measured by the wholesale price index, rose to 7.24% - slower than the previous month's 7.45% and 9.46% in the same year earlier month.But price pressures still remained a risk. The government revised upwards the September reading to 8.07% from the previously reported 7.81%. Policymakers said the moderation in inflation augured well for the economy and expected it slow further in the months ahead. ""Inflation is a challenge. Inflation worries the government. While CPI inflation is sticky, good news is that WPI inflation seems to be trending downwards... If it trends downwards, there will be some reason for comfort,"" finance minister P Chidambaram told Parliament.Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said the moderation in inflation was a good signal. ""I think moderation of inflation is a very good signal. We expect it to moderate slowly and it is good that it has happened,"" said Ahluwalia.""I don't regard 7+ per cent inflation as comfort zone. But the important thing is that if you think it is heading down, then may be the time has come to recognize that inflation is clearly softening and growth is weak and I am sure that RBI knows what to do,"" he said.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will review monetary policy on December 18 and many economists say they might cut interest rates to revive faltering growth. Inflation still remains above the central bank's comfort level while retail inflation is hovering around double-digit levels. While the RBI has indicated that rates may ease, it has said that the decision would be influenced by the growth-inflation dynamics as they unfold. RBI governor D Subbarao has so far fended off calls from the finance ministry to ease rates to revive growth.Data showed that price pressures remained stubborn in cereals, rice, wheat, pulses, fruits and eggs, meat and fish. Wheat prices rose an annual 23.19% while eggs, meat and fish were up 14.19% in November. Vegetables prices were down an annual 1.19% but potato prices shot up an annual 72.20%, while price of pulses rose 19.10%. Food inflation has remained a policy challenge for the government for nearly three years and economists have called for improving supplies to tame the problem.Some economists said RBI is likely to postpone its rate easing until the January-March quarter. ""RBI is likely to wait till January - we maintain our view that the RBI will ease 50 basis points in the January-March quarter. This is in line with the RBI's guidance in its October policy, recent high-frequency data (October IIP up 8.2% and November CPI higher at 9.9%, headline WPI inflation remaining over 7%, and CPI at near double-digits,"" said Rohini Malkani, economist at Citigroup India.""But it's a close call. The RBI has been known to surprise, and while consensus is for RBI keeping rates on hold,Today's print on core WPI coupled with recent reform measures does give an outside chance of the RBI once again surprising markets in the review on December 18,"" Rohini Malkani, economist at Citigroup India, said."
340,From farm gate to your plate,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/from-farm-gate-to-your-plate/article4205641.ece,2012-12-16,The Hindu,"The retail vegetable sellers have now started quoting the prices of almost all items in pao or 250 grammes. The concept of darjan or dozen has almost been replaced by the kilogramme for the humblest of fruits like bananas and oranges. But this means little to the common household which now literally thinks twice before buying any grocery item.A common refrain heard often from politicians is that prices are spiralling. But how this phenomenon -- where the prices of food products in Delhi are now matching those in developed countries like the United States -- has come to such a pass is a matter of real concern.A major cause for this is the difference in rates between wholesale markets and retail outlets in Delhi. The nearly 100 per cent jump in the case of most items is to be blamed. So while potatoes sold at a modal rate of Rs.5.97 per kg in the Azadpur wholesale market on Tuesday, it was selling at an Easy Day outlet in Rohini at Rs.10 per kg, at the Mother Dairy outlet there at Rs.11.90 per kg and at the Thursday market at Rs.15 per kg.Farmers in Punjab recently threw potatoes on the roads as they were not even getting Re.1 per kg for their produce. But here in Delhi the price has not dropped below Rs.15 in the open market even for a day, rues Rupa Srikumar, who now compares prices at different outlets before making purchases.Across the city at Mayur Vihar in East Delhi, Kumud Suri now juggles with her monthly expenses to ensure a healthy diet for her family. The price of eggs has gone up to Rs.50 a dozen for regular size and Rs.70 for the desi variety; bananas here sell for Rs.35 per kg and work out to over Rs.50 per dozen; while potatoes sell for between Rs.15 and Rs.20 per kg; all this is too high for this time of the year.A closer look at the way in which the Indian market functions reveals the cause for the variation. Much of it has to do with the presence of numerous middlemen, transportation costs, bribes paid along the way and inability of most farmers to either cold-chain or preserve food items for long only adds to the yawning gap at which he sells the produce at his gate and the amount the final buyer pays to the retailer.If a farmer is selling something for Rs.100, say onions in Nasik, then by the time it reaches the consumer, the price usually goes up to anywhere between Rs.200 and Rs.250, said an office-bearer of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee, Delhi.The small farmer usually sells at the farm to the locals, and the big ones usually carry their produce to the local mandi or the closest city mandi , the APMC member said. The increase in price between the farm and the local mandi is around 10 per cent. And this includes the 2 per cent (for pulses) to 5 per cent (for fruits and vegetables) commission; and the half to four per cent market fee (1 per cent in Delhi).Incidentally, in Delhi the government collects Rs.80 crore per annum through this fees and almost Rs.60 crore comes from Azadpur, with the three other wholesale markets at Ghazipur, Keshopur and Okhla contributing the rest. Delhi, however, grows very little on its own.Between the local mandi and the small city mandi, another 15 per cent hike in rates comes about and about 3 to 4 per cent of this is due to transportation and labour costs and about 5 per cent is due to packaging and grading. The rest is commission of the agents.From the small city wholesale markets to Delhi, the cost increase is another 10 per cent. Of this Rs.1.50 (from nearby cities in Haryana or U.P.) to Rs.4 per kg (from Bangalore or West Bengal) is the transportation cost. Apart from this there is 6 per cent commission which is charged by the wholesalers, 1 per cent goes towards market fees and 3 per cent is other expenditure, including labour.So on a compounding basis, by the time a Rs.100 product leaves Delhis wholesale markets it already costs Rs.160. From here the product moves to either a retail seller who may be a rehri (cart) or patri (pavement) seller; institutional buyers like canteens and hotels; or semi-wholesaler who breaks it into smaller packs for the small vendors.While the retail sellers charge a 80 to 100 per cent profit, the semi-wholesalers jack up the rates by another 55 to 60 per cent. There is weight loss along the way due to repeated weighing and pilferage etc. and that too is factored into the prices, said the market expert. The APMC regulates the commission at the wholesale markets to a maximum 6 per cent.The concept of hoarding does not apply to these vegetables and fruits, for they are perishable items. It is the competition among the traders which regulates the rates, he says."
341,Price of vegetables has come down,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/price-of-vegetables-has-come-down/article4208509.ece,2012-12-17,The Hindu,": On Sunday, the beginning of Tamil month  Marghazhi  there was a huge turnout at the B.B. Kulam uzhavar sandhai.With heavy arrivals, the shandy was filled with activity from as early as 7 a.m. Vegetables and fruits from nearby fields were fresh and affordable.Ramachandran, a regular visitor to the sandhai, a resident of Viswanathapuram, said that prices of carrot, tomatoes were pretty cheap, when compared with last week.It had almost fallen by 50 per cent in the sandhai. Similar was the case with brinjal and butter beans, he noted.According to the agriculture officer K. Arumugam, who is in charge of the administration of the sandhai, said that carrot price was anywhere between Rs.12 and Rs.14 depending on the variety. Onion was selling at Rs.20 (big) and Rs.44 (small), potatoes sold at Rs.26 per kg, beans Rs.10. Cabbage, which had arrived in large numbers, was available at Rs.10 per kg, ladiesfinger Rs.12 and brinjal Rs.8.As for fruits, the price of banana Rs 3 to 4 each piece, sapotta (Rs 14/kg) and guava Rs 35-40 was fast moving in the sandhai.Many consumers claimed that guava was sold at Rs.45 and Rs.50 in department stores.Almost a majority of the commodities prices had fallen by 30 to 40 per cent from the last week rates.With absence of muhurtham (marriage or other festivities) and rise in the arrivals, the prices had come down.But, the farmers are pretty happy since the number of consumers had gone up manifold.On Sunday alone, an estimated crowd of over 5000 had visited the sandhai here, Mr. Arumugam pointed.There are a little over 70 types of vegetables available in the sandhai, which is open from 7 a.m. to noon or sometimes, it is even stretched beyond that, he summed up."

Even the operational costs and administrative expenses increased recently, but the situation is much worse in other states. It is a new government and its a long way to go.Association president Rampada Paul said: There are about 425 potato cold storage units in the State having a capacity of 60 lakh tons of potatoes per season. The operational cost has gone up by 50 per cent in the last two years but there has been no hike in rental.The cost of labour and fuel has also gone up by 40 per cent in the past two years. Unable to bear the expenses, around 10 cold storage units have already closed down and few more will not be able to function in next year, Mr. Paul said. The Association said rents for cold storage units were last revised in February 2010. Mr. Biswas said there was an agrarian crisis and nothing could be done."
343,Far from the madding crowd,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/true-lies/far-from-the-madding-crowd/,2012-12-22,The Times Of India,"It was Friday, December 14, one day before the campaign for the Gujarat state assembly polls was to end. I reached my office in Gandhinagar unusually early, at 8.00 am. As I was about to reach, I noticed some journalist colleagues from the local electronics media getting ready to go to a rally that was to be addressed by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi just about 20 km away, at Kalol town. They were busy prominently pasting Media in front of their car, so that the security wouldnt bother them. One of them made a polite offer: Come along, you will enjoy. Well return by the afternoon. I refused, saying my intention was to go far from the madding crowd, away to a place where there wasnt much of political noise.Its generally sheer waste of time listening to a leader. They will all tell you all what you know about, nothing new, I told them, as they looked at me suspiciously. I moved on to my office. After phoning up a couple of persons, I decided to go with a friend to Sabarkantha district, where former MP and now All-India Congress Committee general secretary Madhusudan Mistry, was camping, taking short meetings in big villages and small towns.I have always had some liking for Mistry, who joined politics late in 1990s. I knew him much before he was picked up and inserted into politics by then BJP rebel and now Congress leader Shankarsinh Vaghela. At that time, Mistry headed a voluntary organization, working on tribal human rights. I never liked Mistry joining politics, but he had his own reasons. He would tell me theres nothing wrong if your aims are clear. I dont know if Mistry succeeded in his aims (whatsoever they may be), yet he is one politician whom one can trust. He doesnt bluff, and refuses to be propagandistic.We drove down to a spot where Mistry was getting ready to address a small meeting  it was Titoi village. Even as he was preparing, I asked him, How are things going?, and he told me about the village. Its a service village. Do you know whats that? Its a village where people within seven kilometers periphery come to shop for daily needs. You can get yourself treated for ailments here. Here, different communities interact. Its a village with mixed population, where people from different castes and creeds live, he told me. In between, a Congressman from Rajasthan interrupted, giving him the results of a survey which predicted Congress victory in the region. Good enough, he said matter-of-factly, and proceeded for his address.Mistrys speech didnt interest me, as I knew what he was going to speak. But what locals said from the rostrum certainly did. The humming state highway just next to the village had already changed the face of the village. It had just been converted into a four-lane road with World Bank support, and such was the silky highway that truckers from neighbouring states had begun to prefer it to the national highway, which ran parallel to this one, to go to Rajasthan and up north. Transport was a major activity which seemed to support Titoi villagers livelihood, relegating agriculture to the secondary position. The first demand of the locals was to remove toll tax on the highway for those living next to the state highway, giving them free movement passes. Then came irrigation.As we moved away from the state highway, towards the hilly tract through arid plains, we found more and more people demanding irrigation, as their fields remained barren due to lack of rains. If it rains, we can earn, otherwise we are at the mercy of the local moneylenders, we were told. Several dams were built in the district  Mazam, Hathmati, Vatrak, Meshvo, Harnav, Khedva. But none irrigate their fields which belonged to backward class farmers, including tribals. The tribal farmers living in region, sure of land titles under the Forest Rights Act, wanted their land to be fertile. Gone are the days when they were being evicted from the fields they cultivated, said Lallubhai Desai, a respected figure, who runs an NGO in a tribal town Khedbrahma. Yet, irrigation seemed to be a tall order. You must create structures to lift water from the canals to a higher altitude, and it would mean extra power, adding to the cost of irrigation.I went around several villages, but I found very little campaigning. The atmosphere seemed to replicate the dull fields through which district roads passed. People didnt seem to talk politics. Perhaps they had decided whom to vote. In one village, Navagam, I found two small Congress flags quietly hanging on a lamp post. Beyond the village, as we moved towards the fields, I stopped at one place, finding drip irrigation network being laid down by farm workers. We inquired whose field was it, and we were told the farmer was Jagdish Patel. We contacted the farmer, who asked us to drive through a rough-and-tough road, on which only tractors move. Dont you worry, Maruti Alto has been on this route, we were told by the messenger who escorted us through the fields, sitting on his motorbike.After driving through the fields on the kutcha road with wild bushes on both sides, we were asked to park our car, from where we must walk about a kilometer. To our utter surprise, we saw nothing but drip irrigation network all around. Away from the din of politics which surrounded busy towns of Gujarat on that day, Patel was quietly busy mixing pesticides into a small tank, which would take the medicated water through the network into the fields. On his 50 acres field, he was preparing to grow a particular variety of potato, which he identified as lady rosta. It had higher dry matter. I asked Patel who takes away potatoes. Balaji, Pepsico, ITC and Real Wafer pick them up here. Our potatoes make much better chips than those from Indore. Our 100 kg of potatoes give six kg of wafers, while Indores get you five-and-a-half kg.Ask him how he achieved this, as no surface irrigation was available, and he replies, Thanks to drip. I began 10 years ago, much before Narendra Modi introduced 50 per cent subsidy. Patel seemed to be a Modi supporter, though with a rider. He called drip a Modi karishma, which 60 per cent of the farmers of our village follow. He added, The nearby check-dam coupled with wide-scale use of drip has led to sharp rise in water tables. The bore-well which was 140 feet deep is just 100 feet deep.Yet, Patel didnt agree with Modis critique of foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail. Modi seems to be saying all this because of political reasons. I dont think he opposes FDI in retail, Patel says, wondering, Modi wants foreign investments, holds summits, how can he oppose FDI? Patel further said, With FDI, the monopoly of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees, controlled by trader-middlemen, will end. We wouldnt have to sell our produce to the middlemen, who give farmers a poor price, hogging huge profits by selling in retail at a very high rate. As an example, he said, the farmers get just about Rs 20 per 40 kg of tomatoes, while the price in retail is Rs 200. FDI is a win-win situation for the farmer and the consumer. The farmer gets a better price, while the consumer gets cheaper tomato, he says, predicting Modi will end his opposition to FDI once back to power.Back home, I kept guessing who will win. Unlike big cities, I didnt find much support for Modi in rural Sabarkantha. Even rich farmers, who gave Modi credit for the success in agriculture, were skeptical. On December 20, when Modi was declared a great winner, I was busy collecting figures from the office of the Election Commission in Gandhinagar, and I got a phone call from Mistry. I remembered you of others. Youd come to Sabarkantha. We won six out of seven seats, he said, asking me to come down for a cup of tea. I went to him, and he added, I can now show to the high command that at least in Sabarkantha, which has been my karmabhoomi, Congress remains strong. In between, he was being interrupted by phone calls from TV anchors, who wanted him to appear as Congress commentator. Its such a waste of time, he said smiling, as he kept refusing."
344,Issue of easy gun accessibility ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1121224/jsp/northeast/story_16354728.jsp,2012-12-24,Telegraph,"The horrific slaughter of 26 people, including 20 children between six and seven, in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, once again brings to fore exigent social issues related to easy accessibility. In an incident that has stunned people across the globe, a 20-year-old gunman first killed his mother at home, picked out a .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle (one that is similar to a weapon that is being currently used by American troops in Afghanistan) and other guns from his mothers collection and carried out the carnage at Sandy Hook Elementary School before turning the gun on himself. Ironically, this maniacs mother was infatuated with guns and owned an arsenal which included, apart from the rifle, two potent handguns and two hunting rifles. She had apparently rubbed off some of her gun-culture onto her son, being known to have often taken him to the firing range for shooting practice. Most significantly, all the guns had been legally purchased and registered with the authorities. The Newtown tragedy reveals the reality that America is her worst enemy and does not require imported terrorism to unleash death and mayhem. There has not been a single attack of terrorism on US soil since 9/11, testifying to the effectiveness of the measures taken by the law enforcement authorities to ensure internal security. Yet, time and again, America has shown that it is impossible to guard society from within, particularly from citizens who allow bigotry to get the better of them, or have slipped through the bounds of sanity. In August, Wade Michael Page, a die-hard racist who believed in a typical neo-Nazi manner in white supremacy, had gunned down six Sikhs at a gurdwara at Oak Creek in Wisconsin and injured others, including a policeman. In July this year, a man called James Holmes walked into a movie-theatre in Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, and opened fire on the audience during the premiere of the latest Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises, leaving 12 people dead and 58 injured. Such gruesome slaughters had then raised questions about the ease with which guns could be purchased in the US, and roused a protesting chorus against prevalent gun laws. However, the nation then was in the midst of campaign for the presidency, thus even candidate and President Barack Obama, a known opponent of these lax laws, refrained from expressing his opinion on them in fear of further estranging the predominantly white pro-gun lobby. That has been the crux of the problem in the US, for even some moderates, let alone powerful organisations such as the National Rifle Association, the weapons-manufacturing industry, White supremists as well as fringe elements in society swear by the Second Amendment of the American Constitution which categorically states that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. More than anyone else, Obama will comprehend that any attempt to shackle this right will raise the proverbial hornets nest in his nation, despite tragedies like those of Newtown and Denver. No doubt he has reacted to the shock the horrendous massacre of six to seven-year-olds has roused to assert that such tragedies must end, and he would use whatever power this office holds to work towards that end. Yet it is more probable that like the prior periodic massacres which have made the US one of the most unsafe places on the planet, the Newton massacre, too, would sink into oblivion with the passage of time and things remain as they were, given the numbers stacked against the Democrats in the US House of Representatives. As for the public outcry at present gripping the US regarding the Newtown massacre, simultaneous reports also tell of long queues being formed in gun-shops across the nation by people clamouring to buy the .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle and other assault weapons in anticipation of a probable ban on their purchase in the coming months. Those who are against the American gun-culture are of the opinion that the ease with which firearms of the most deadly variety can be purchased, almost off the counter, will ensure that the lives of ordinary Americans will continue to remain in danger coming from most unexpected places. Reportedly, statistics seem to bear them out. In 2011, more than 9,000 people were killed in the US, with 75 per cent of the deaths being due to gunshot wounds as opposed to only 10 per cent gun-deaths in the UK. However those who are against stringent gun laws, opine that it is society which creates dysfunctional human beings, rather than the easy accessibility to guns, which is responsible for such tragedies. They argue that even if guns were harder to come by, a potential assassin would find ways and means to get his hand on one, no matter what the laws are. They point to the case of Norway, which has far more stringent gun-laws than the US, where Anders Breivik gunned down no less than 69 people to drive home their point. By putting the onus on the social system they imply that ease of accessibility is not a significant factor for social malaise of any nature. Thus, the argument will drag on, not only in far off America, but all across the world. There appears to be no conclusive shutdown to the debate with incontrovertible arguments stacked in favour of any side. One can cite the easy availability of prescription drugs over the counter in India to illustrate the pros and cons of the issue. Given the sorry state of government hospitals and dispensaries in India in conjunction with the exorbitant cost of medical treatment in the private sector, even educated and otherwise enlightened individuals have taken to self-medication for mostly minor ailments. This has led to overuse or misuse of life-saving medicines like antibiotics, with germs and viruses developing increasing resistance and emerging into antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Had there been a properly monitored healthcare system such misuse may perhaps have been nipped in the bud. But since even doctors in government-run medical facilities meant for the economically weaker section of society demand bribes, and those in privately run hospitals call for numerous and costly tests even for minor ailments, many will prefer a system of medicine availability without having to spend the time and money to visit a doctor and obtain a proper diagnosis and prescription. At the same time, there are numerous instances to show that easy availability does exacerbate a social malaise. For example, closer at hand, we have the case of Manipur, where the drug problem as well as the ancillary problems like HIV has become endemic in certain segments of the population. It is salutary to note that Manipur lies on the fringe of the notorious drug-production golden-triangle and is also a nodal point for smuggling of narcotics to other parts of the world. Thus, the spill-over effect is responsible for that states travails. Similarly, in a metro like Guwahati, according to police reports, a majority of street crimes and accidents are alcohol- related, this city being reputed to have far more liquor shops than those selling books or medicines! However, scepticism continues to prevail among a large segment of society whether easy availability is the actual cause of social malaise, or is such availability the result, in the first place, of inadequacies in a specific society or the perception of a societys citizens of what they assume is needed. Psychologists, too, are ambivalent on the issue, for not enough research has been done for a conclusive assertion. Clearly, it is the old use of a knife syndrome. One can shove a knife in someones stomach or peel potatoes and make French fries with it, the knife being in no way responsible!"
345,EU promotes potato to replace rice in Asia,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/eu-promotes-potato-to-replace-rice-in-asia/article4239842.ece,2012-12-26,The Hindu,"The potato has a 12,000-year-old history but an even brighter future as a crop that is set to replace rice as a staple in the Asian rice-consuming countries. It requires less amount of water compared to other basic food products, without compromising the nutrition value. Potato, therefore, is increasingly being promoted, in the genetically modified organism-free European Union (EU), as the foremost solution for meeting the increased food demand for an estimated 6 billion world population by 2030.Dutch researchers from the famous Wageningen University  dedicated to bio-based economy in food, feed and chemicals produced from renewable resources  told a visiting press delegation that if prepared in a healthy manner and consumed in the right proportion (balanced reduction of calories), consumers can benefit from the many nutrients and dietary fibres in the tuber.The advantages of potato over other staples were discussed at the Potato Potential Conference, which was followed by a vibrant food exposition organised by the Enterprise Europe Network and Food Valley that facilitated networking of global companies in the potato business. The EUs focus is now on Eastern Europe and China for processed food markets. The visiting journalists were told that China is already moving towards experiments with replacing rice with potato.The diverse advantage of potato  the fourth largest consumed food in the world after maize, rice and wheat  is emphasised by studies that have shown potato containing less calories than pasta, rice and bread. The tuber consumes about 30 per cent less water to grow than rice and is being projected as a crop that can contribute to weight loss if prepared and consumed healthily.Researchers and scientists are working towards facilitating higher and sustainable crop yields per hectare that are free from disease and pests.With an annual export of about eight million tonnes of certified seed potato, the tuber is not only a staple food for the Dutch, but a major contributor to the economy. Netherlands, known for its success in water management, is the worlds third largest agriculture exporter, second biggest agri-food exporter and third largest potato exporter.The Dutch potato sector is constantly breeding, growing and selecting new varieties based on market demands. Simultaneously, processing companies (like Aviko) continuously experiment with the quality and flavour of their potato fries and how to get the best by-products from wastes like potato peels and starch-rich waste water.The potato crop is normally hit by the most common late blight disease (caused by phytophthora infestans ), scab, rhizoctonia , canker, blackleg, fusarium and viral diseases. All research at Wageningen is in partnership with private and multinational companies and, at the same time, with medical institutions so as to not lose sight of the nutritional and safety aspects in food products.Quality standardsThe EU has laid down stringent standards for member countries for seeds and seed potatoes to coordinate with the demand and supply. The visiting press team saw the high standards maintained by the Netherlands government at the NAK, the Dutch General Inspection Service for Agriculture Seeds and Seed Potatoes at Emmeloord. Technical Coordinator of Inspections Jaap Haak explained that every seed potato that comes out of a farm must have quality certification from the NAK.The Plant Protection Service of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, too, monitors the quality of seed potatoes, especially on phytosanitary issues of health, varietal purity and physiological conditions. Interestingly, the NAK has on its board representatives of farmers, breeders, propagators and traders in a set-up in which the farm sector formulates its own standards in line with international measures. The costs are shared by farmers and traders.Mr. Haak said that only produce from fields free of nematodes are accepted for inspection. Farmers must also specify the sources of the seed, its variety and class. Inspections are visual, in the labs as well as on-field. As the grower prepares the lots for delivery, NAK inspectors visit the plot at least once a day to ensure that only the approved lots are being delivered.Niecks WitteUnder its Participatory Potato Breeding programme, the Wageningen University collaborates with farmers in producing required varieties. Niek Vos, an organic farmer-breeder, took 12 years to develop the Bionca variety, by crossing small South Holland potatoes with blight-resistant potatoes from Mexico. His is a white fleshy potato variety, resistant to late blight disease, and he sells it under his own brand name  Nieks Witte (Niecks White).I turned to organic farming because when I was in conventional farming, my neighbours complained that the late blight afflicting their crop was coming from my field. I thought it was better to grow a variety that has no blight and now I have my own Nieks Witte , he said.He also has an on-farm cold storage of 100 tonnes capacity. He uses cow manure on his well-managed and clean farm and follows the good practice of keeping his 70-hectare field free after every two years to maintain soil health.The organic potato is three to four times more expensive than the conventional one, but Mr. Vos believes this market is growing.Mr. Vos has an India connection. After finishing studies, his daughter Michiel travelled to Puducherry to think out what she wanted to do in life. She decided to return to Netherlands and join her father in growing potatoes  such is the power of the tuber in Netherlands.Netherlands is the worlds third largest potato exporterThe Dutch Ministry of Agriculture monitors the quality of seed potatoes"

While Jayarama Iyer himself looks like a sage disinterested in the outcome of this mammoth enterprise, his sons, Vittal, Ramesh, Hari and daughter, Usha, can be spotted all over the place supervising the service and enquiring after customers. All of them look burly and well-fed  a good sign that the food is rich and made in pure ghee. They make 50 items in a day and almost all of them taste delicious. Which explains why the crowd keeps coming back for more. Vaango, vaango! Enna saapadrael ? Vadai sooda irukku !, announces one of the brothers as if he were hosting a family wedding. I decide to try the rare items on the menu, which has a staggering amount of delicacies a foodie can absolutely not resist. I try the ammani kozhukattai , capsicum paruppu usili sevai , semiya pongal , potato vadai from the South Indian fare. I sample the kulcha and palak panneer rather reluctantly, but firmly turn down the chaat-s, juice, milkshake and hot parotta -s. Without a doubt, the south Indian food wins in authenticity and taste. Courteous waiters bring on the perfectly textured wheat halwa , a light-yellow pineapple halwa mild on sugar and ghee, and the Ashok halwa popularised in Tiruvaiyaru.This has become like a food festival, Vittal states, unable to hide his pride at being in charge of the most popular canteen in the season. We use only mineral water and the highest-quality ingredients for cooking. We have 75 people working here and they are paid very well and looked after as family.But arent the prices a bit steep for relatively small portions? Vittal disagrees strongly: Prices have increased but the crowd has not diminished one bit.

348,So close but out of French tax reach,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1121231/jsp/foreign/story_16383179.jsp,2012-12-31,Telegraph,"Gerard Depardieu enters his home in Paris on December 19. (Reuters) Nchin, Belgium, Dec. 30: The last time a big star lit up this sleepy village of potato fields and rain-drenched pastures was in 1667, when the Sun King, Louis XIV of France, stopped by for the day. But even he may not have created quite the commotion caused by Grard Depardieu, the celebrated actor, turbulent bon vivant and, since a visit to the mayors office here on December 7 to register as a resident, Frances most reviled tax exile. I thought it was a joke, said the mayor, Daniel Senesael, recalling his disbelief when he was first told that Depardieu intended to leave his mansion in Paris and move to Nchin, a rural settlement in Belgium with just 2,200 people, two cafes, a fast-food fry shop, a ruined chateau and no cinema. Lets be honest, this is not Las Vegas, Senesael said. There are no lights and no discos. I get flooded with complaints when anyone suggests opening even a wind farm. Michel Sardou, a veteran French singer who has joined a frenzy of criticism directed at Depardieu in France, mocked the actors flight to Nchin, predicting that he would be as bored as a rat here. So, there is some divine justice after all, the singer joked on French television. For Depardieu, and scores of wealthy French citizens who already live here, however, Nchin does have one seductive asset: it is beyond the reach of the French tax authorities but so close to France that an unmarked border running through the village puts the gardens of some properties in France and adjoining houses in Belgium. Our geographic situation makes us very attractive, said Senesael, noting that Nchin is an easy place to get into and out of, with a nearby airport, a major highway and a railway station just a few miles away in the French city of Lille with regular high-speed trains to Paris, Brussels and London. Nobody should be astonished that big fortunes have found a certain fiscal advantage in moving to this side of the border, said the mayor, whose domain covers Nchin and a cluster of other hamlets that form what is known as the Entity of Estaimpuis. Depardieus critics, he said, should direct their ire not at the actor but at the failure of European governments to harmonise tax rates across the 27 nations of the European Union. A customs post and border guards disappeared decades ago from the end of Nchins main street, swept away by Europes effort after World War II to break down barriers that led to past conflicts and to allow for the free flow of goods, services and people. Still firmly in place, however, are rigidly defined tax frontiers that mean that people living just a few yards from one another can pay vastly different levels of tax, particularly if they happen to be wealthy. Belgium has higher income taxes for most people than in much of Europe, but the country is much easier on the rich than France, where the government of President Franois Hollande has announced a temporary supertax of 75 per cent on annual incomes of more than $1.3 million. Frances Constitutional Council on Saturday declared the tax unconstitutional, prompting the government to announce that it would introduce a revised version next year. France also has a wealth tax on assets worth more than $1.7 million, something that does not exist in Belgium, as well as far higher taxes on capital gains and inheritance. Weve abolished border controls but not all the other stupidities, said Philippe Vandenhemel, the owner of a garage just outside Nchin that sells and repairs imported American cars and was visited several times by Depardieu. (The actor apparently likes old American cars.) Vandenhemel scoffed at attacks on the movie star by French politicians and commentators. If I were in his shoes, I would do exactly the same thing and leave, he said. Depardieu, he added, will benefit not only from lower taxes in Belgium but also from the fact that we Belgians are not jealous and dont mind people getting rich. Jealousy is Frances national disease, he said. Depardieu, who is formally registered as domiciled in Nchin since his visit to the mayor in early December, still has not actually moved into a house he bought here. But he has visited a few times, dining at bistros in nearby villages and buying sausages from a Nchin butcher."
349,Trouble ahead for Bengal potato farmers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/trouble-ahead-for-bengal-potato-farmers/article4257828.ece,2012-12-31,The Hindu,"Bengal potato farmers may face low realisation when the new crop hits the market in mid-January due to the prospect of fall in cold storage capacity.Due to non-revision of rentals in the last three years, cold storage owners are facing severe cost pressure and if the government does not take corrective measure, closure of small cold stores seems imminent, West Bengal Cold Storage Association president Rampada Paul said.Supply increaseHe feared that on one hand there will be a sudden supply of potato in the market as sowing was delayed by 10-15 days.On the other hand, threat remains for closure of at least small cold storages in the State as there was no rental hike in the last three years and operation costs have jumped by at least 50 per cent, Mr. Paul said.In this situation, chances are high that potato farmers may face price crash as output is expected to rise while storing capacity may decline if the State government does not take corrective measures, he said.Small cold storagesSmall cold storages account for nearly 10 million tonnes of storing capacity out of total 60 lakh tonne of potato.According to Mr. Paul, there are around 100 small cold storages out of a total of 425 across the State. Already 10 units have closed their operations. This year, potato production is estimated at 100 lakh tonnes compared to 84 lakh tonnes last year.This is due to two reasons, one there was crop damage and this year sowing coverage had increased by 4-5 per cent. Mr. Paul said the heavy supply of the Bengal potato crop will come in mid-February. - PTI"
