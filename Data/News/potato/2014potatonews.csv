I dont want to die. They are talking on Skype in Sindhi as they often do, since first meeting at Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, in May 2013.Kiran had gone there with her parents to undergo surgery for her congenital heart defect (hole in the heart) that should have been operated upon when she was much younger. But her father Sikandar Ali Soomro, a tall, thin matriculate who earns daily wages selling potato wafers at a Karachi roadside stall could not afford the operation. Her parents were resigned to losing Kiran, a weak and sickly child.Kiran Soomro: I want to liveBut she wouldnt give up. Pulled out of school when she was five, Kiran studied at home. A few years ago, as a spunky teenager, she realised that without the surgery, she would die. She wept, and told her parents she wanted to live, says Nitu.Kirans determination gave her father strength and he started trying to find a way to help her. He approached the media, and some Sindhi channels in Pakistan ran interviews of the family.The publicity helped to raise enough money go to Delhi for treatment. But doctors there found Kiran inoperable due to a serious lung infection. They put her on medication for six months. She is now so much better, she tells Nitu, that she can even run.When she came to India she could not even walk, says Nitu. On Skype, the bubbly Kiran shows her Indian didi (sister) her clothes, and tries to learn English words.Nitu, 26, a classical dancer in her final year of a Masters degree in Kathak, does ballets on Sindhi culture. In Dubai for a performance about a year ago, she met Sarang Sindhi, a producer with Sindh TV, Pakistan. A neighbour of the Soomros from Karachi, he asked Nitu to look out for them when they went to Delhi in May. Nitu is a fluent Sindhi-speaker, whose great-grandfather had migrated from Sindh, Pakistan after 1947.Nitu Jiwnani: Stepping up for her adopted Pakistani familyThats what connected us, the language, says Nitu. I felt like Kiran is my sister. We spoke about folk tales Salman Khan Shahrukh KhanNitu had visited Pakistan for a couple of months earlier, in February-March, staying in Jamshoro with her friend Saif Samejo of The Sketches, and his family.It was another experience altogether. I never knew there were Sindhis in Pakistan who spoke Sindhi, she says. Entering Pakistan on foot at Wagah border, she had spent the day with a Punjabi family, friends of the visa officer at the Pakistan Embassy in Delhi who had interviewed her.Nitu now refers to Sikandar Ali as Abbu, and Kirans mother Shamshad, as Ammi. They call her their eldest daughter.The money raised earlier has all been spent on Kirans lung treatment and other expenses. One benefactor donated them a laptop, and Sikandar Ali created a Facebook account to highlight his daughters plight.Kiran and her siblings at home, readingOn January 20, 2014, Kiran turns 17. No one had expected her to live this long. The long-delayed heart surgery, not possible in Pakistan at this stage, must take place at the earliest.I wanted to collect funds in May, but Abbu (Sikandar Ali) said, after six months they will do her reports again and see whether she is operable, says Nitu.Others have joined Nitu to support Kiran, like Haresh Jiwnani, 42, a relative of Nitus in Karachi. He accompanied Kiran when she had to go to the hospital for her tests in December, and has been helping with other logistics too.Kiran has lost most of her childhood due to illness.When the new test reports indicated that Kiran is operable, Nitu started sending out appeals to raise money for the surgery.I am an Indian and want to save this Little Pakistani Girl! she posted on the Aman ki Asha facebook group on December 30, 2013. Please people come forward and help this little girl SHE WANTS TO LIVE !!!At that point, Kirans operation in India was estimated to cost about USD 8,000. However, Nitu subsequently got in touch with Dr. Devi Shetty at Naryana Hrudalya hospital, Bangalore, where the procedure will be done for around USD 3,200. That brings the total amount needed to around USD 6,500, including air travel for Kiran and her parents (doctors recommend two attendants) and other expenses, which may increase, depending on her condition.It is heartening to see Indians and Pakistanis step up to for this cause. Within a couple of days of Nitus appeal, her Indian friends and relatives donated USD 2,500, a similar amount. Others are coming forward. Many thoughts and prayers are with Kiran as she starts the visa procedure to leave for India at the earliest.Thank you, Nitu Jiwnani, for bringing this case to our attention. May your efforts to save young Kiran succeed.beena.sarwar@amankiasha.com"

Chauhan and Justice J. Chelameswar adding: ""Now we have no other business. We have to arrange cheap onions and potatoes.""As the court junked the PIL telling the petitioner Vishnu Pratap Singh Langawat not to burden the court with such public interest suits, in the same breadth, it observed that clients are willing to pay high fees.Langawat had sought the direction to the central government for enforcement of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 especially with respect to onions, tomatoes and potatoes.Parliament, the PIL said, in 1955 enacted the Essential Commodities Act to control the production, supply and distribution of commodities which are specified in the legislation to be essential commodities.But despite unprecedented rise in the price of essential commodities, especially vegetables like tomatoes, onions, potatoes, garlic etc. which are the basic ingredients of Indian meals, the central government did nothing to control prices of the said foodstuffs by invoking the act against middlemen and traders for alleged excessive hoarding, it contended."
2,SC hot potatoes: onion and car screen ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140111/jsp/nation/story_17776367.jsp,2014-01-11,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Jan. 10: A Supreme Court bench today peeled itself away from activism, offering advice seasoned in humour that may bring forth tears than titters in kitchens but exercising judicial prudence. Mr Counsel, stop eating onions for two months and the prices will come down, the bench told an advocate who moved the court to issue a directive to the Centre to rein in prices of vegetables. The comment in half-jest was complemented by a reference to another much-debated issue: judicial activism. Dont burden us with all these type of things . It is like now we have no other business but to keep checking and arresting the prices of potatoes and onions, the bench of Justices B.S. Chauhan and J. Chelameshwar told Vishnu Pratap Singh Langawat, who filed the public interest litigation. By declining to intervene, the court has steered clear of a perception that some judges are increasingly entering the domain of the executive  a view strengthened by legal scrutiny of private coaching centres and an order to set up a national green regulator. Langawat had knocked the doors of the Supreme Court with the plea that the Centre be asked to invoke the Essential Commodities Act to prevent hoarding and cartelisation. The act is usually invoked by state governments. Farmers are often misled, market prices are manipulated and supplies reduced to create artificial crises and cause economic distress among the general public, especially the poor and weaker section of the society. It is basically traders and hoarders, middlemen with political clout, who are responsible for economically exploiting the primary producers (farmers) and the ultimate consumers (general public), the PIL said. So-called hoarders and cartels are the usual suspects invariably blamed for price rise but it is not clear what courts can do to tackle them. Asked later if he will take the grievance to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwals debut durbar tomorrow, Langawat said: I have no such intention. My concern over the rising prices related to the entire country and not just Delhi. Although in jest, the court has touched upon a little-discussed issue by suggesting abstention from onion. Nutrition scientists say a two-month, self-imposed ban on onions in the kitchen will not necessarily hurt human health. Onions have been shown to have certain health benefits, theyre nutritionally very good and they inject taste and flavour into food, but that doesnt make them essential, said Jamuna Prakash, professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Mysore. Over time, Prakash said, people have become used to consuming onions in diet. But sections of people in India have long rejected onions. Centuries-old traditional practices also mention Saatvik diets that do not contain certain foods such as onion and garlic. Onions primarily cater to taste, Prakash said. While the poor consume chapatis and onions laced with green chillies and salt, she said, such a diet alone would not be healthy as it does not provide nutrients that would be available from other vegetables, pulses and legumes. Jai Gopal, the head of the Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research in Pune, estimates that Indias per capita onion consumption is about 7kg a person per year, nearly the same as the global average per capita onion consumption of 6kg. Americas National Onion Association lists Libya as the country with the highest consumption of onions. An average Libyan consumes about 29kg of onions a year."
3,Prices of essential items rise ahead of Sankranti,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/prices-of-essential-items-rise-ahead-of-sankranti/article5575606.ece,2014-01-14,The Hindu,"With Bangaloreans gearing up for celebrating Makara Sankranti, the markets are flooded with sugarcane, sweet potato, flowers, trays, bowls, boxes and containers in different hues and shapes.All markets, be it in Malleswaram, Gandhi Bazaar, Jayanagar or Madiwala, were crowded on Monday with people making purchases for the festival. But both vendors and customers agree that the price of essential commodities for the festival such as jaggery, sugarcane, sweet potato have risen ahead of the festival.Pushpalatha M.K. (64), retired engineer, who was shopping at the Malleshwaram market, said: The price of all commodities has gone up. So, we plan to celebrate the festive on a small scale this year. I have purchased all festival-related items in small quantities. But we will certainly celebrate the festival as we cannot leave behind our age-old tradition.A vendor in the Malleswaram market too echoed the same sentiment. Mohammed Hanif, who has been selling boxes for 25 years, said that there was a slight drop in the sales this year because of spiralling prices of essential commodities. Sitting amidst colourful boxes in different colours and shapes, he said that the boxes are priced between Rs. 5 and Rs. 75 each.Nagamma M. said that there was a wide variety of yellu bella and sugar candies.Most of the coloured and factory made sugar candies are not in great demand this year. Most people this year are opting for homemade products, she added.While a section of society will celebrate Sankranti on Tuesday, other sections will celebrate it on Wednesday."
4,Bihar vs Bengal over gangrape andÂ murder,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/bihar-vs-bengal-over-gangrape-and-murder/,2014-01-15,Indian Express,"The murdered girls parents at Howrah station, back after meeting Nitish in Patna. (Photo: Subham Dutta)The outrage over the gangrape and murder in Madhyamgram, 25 km from Kolkata, has drifted into a game of political one-upmanship between West Bengal and Bihar, where the girls family hails from and where it is now set to return.The family had initially been insisting on staying in West Bengal to seek justice for the girl. They had lodged protests, including with the President and the governor, against some top police officials whom they accused of threatening them with eviction and advising them to escape to Bihar if they felt persecuted in Bengal. The family changed its mind this week after meeting Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who invited them to settle there with a government job.As newspapers in Bihar splashed the rape, murder and alleged persecution of the family on its pages over several days, the chief minister first sent a police team to talk to the family. The girls father drives a taxi and, as such, Nitish was addressing a large constituency in both states. According to transport operators in West Bengal, Kolkata has over 50,000 taxi drivers and most of them are from Bihar, some with their families settled in Kolkata and some back in Bihar.Bengals ruling Trinamool Congress responded immediately with minister Firhad Hakim, often considered a voice for Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, launching an attack on Bihars move to send the police team. Bobby Hakim said the decision violated the federal principles of governance, while Mukul Roy described it as unnecessary, unethical, and parochial politics.However, according to the sustained, very forceful complaints from the family, it was the Bengal police who were parochial with their alleged threats of eviction. In the face of complaints of such serious nature, the Bengal chief secretary publicly defended the administration saying there had been no lapses and the family given all protection and security. This came after the family had lost its only daughter and sought refuge in a CITU-run commune in Kolkata.What happened at the commune, too, had significant political connotations. Nitishs police team found a cordial host in the CITU and CPM leadership, whose welcome was in sharp contrast to the virulent attacks from the Trinamool Congress leadership. Since then, political circles in Bengal have been discussing the eventual shape of a possible third front  or federal front as Mamata would have wished it.Nitishs upstaging of Mamata reached a high point on Monday when the girls family met him in Patna. Nitish invited them to Bihar and assured the father a job as a government driver.Now that the family has decided to take up the offer, the Trinamool Congress has launched a fresh attack for what it calls a violation of federal principles. We cannot stop anyone from leaving the state, but I can say that we would have provided better protection had they decided to stay back, said minister Jyotipriya Mallick, organisationally in charge of North 24-Parganas, the district where the girl was raped and murdered. The effort of the neighbouring state is politically motivated and it violates the rules of a federal structure.Such allegations can be a double-edged sword, however. One need not travel far back to find examples of parochialism in West Bengal. A couple of months ago, when potato prices soared, Mamata ordered the police and civil administration to seal all borders so that no trucks carrying potatoes from Bengal could enter Bihar or Orissa. Bengals homes must be assured potatoes first, she declared, and the police intercepted several thousand trucks headed beyond the borders and forcibly diverted them to markets in Kolkata and elsewhere in Bengal.As potatoes became even costlier in Orissa, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik reportedly requested Bengal to allow the trucks out, but in vain. Orissas potato then traders hit back, blockading roads and preventing trucks with fish and other goods from moving into West Bengal.Federal principles had taken a back seat following the Uttarakhand landslides, too. Mamatas government sent a team including two ministers to stand by tourists from Bengal. Returning from a state where the local administration itself was reeling under the impact of the calamity, one of the Bengal ministers played up homeland sentiments by alleging that many women from Bengal had been harassed by local men.Despite talks of federalism, it is evident that regional groups headed by leaders such as Mamata, Nitish and Naveen will consciously keep playing to their home constituencies.Subrata NagchoudhuryFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The central bank is scheduled to announce its quarterly monetary policy review on January 28.The RBI had increased the key policy rate (repo) twice between September and November to check inflation. The rate is currently 7.75 per cent.According to the WPI data, inflation in primary articles basket and the fuel and power segment was at 10.78 per cent and 10.98 per cent, respectively.Inflation in manufactured products such as sugar and edible oils was flat at 2.64 per cent on a monthly basis."

In November, wholesale price inflation increased at the fastest pace in 14 months at 7.52 per cent.The moderation in December WPI figures comes on the back of easing prices of essential food items, including vegetables, cereals and protein-rich items.Inflation in food articles, which has a 14.34 per cent share in the WPI basket, was 13.68 per cent in December, official data showed. It was 19.93 per cent in November.Inflation in vegetables declined to 57.33 per cent in December from 95.25 per cent in the previous month.

Industrial output in November contracted 2.1 per cent, the worst performance in six months.The easing of inflation at a time when industrial growth continues to be in the red should induce RBI to review its monetary policy stance and cut its policy rates to rejuvenate growth, which has been hit by high interest costs, flagging investments and subdued demand, CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.October inflation was revised upward to 7.24 per cent from 7 per cent earlier.""Taking both growth and inflation dynamics into account, we think the RBI's bias is not to hike rates, and maintaining a cautious stance.

7,Something to cheer and chew: veg rates are falling,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/something-to-cheer-and-chew-veg-rates-are-falling/article5580843.ece,2014-01-16,The Hindu,"The city residents have a reason to smile, amid the news reports that the fall in the vegetable prices has resulted in reduced inflation rates nationwide.After showing no sign of let up since March to till November last year, prices of the vegetables have begun to slide down and finally are within the reach of the common man.The fall in the prices has been remarkable when compared with the prices a month ago with some vegetables such as tomato registering 67 to 75 per cent decline.Brinjal, potato, onions and carrots also recorded a steep decline in prices.In Rythu Bazaars, tomato, irrespective of the variety, costs Rs.4 to Rs.5 per kg, down from its swagger at Rs.14 to Rs.16 per kg a month ago and even worse at Rs.26 for the hybrid variety six months ago.At the wholesale markets, tomato is costing even lesser, at Rs.2 per kg.Brinjal, which was costing Rs.18 per kg on December 18, is now available at Rs.8 per kg, while potato has slid down to Rs.14 per kg from Rs.22 per kg both clocking over 50 per cent fall.Onion, which posed major threat to the government by spiralling to almost Rs.80 per kg till very recently, will now ease the wallet only by Rs.16 per kilogram.Though the vegetable prices usually come down during winter months, the latest price crash is a moment to cherish, in view of the exorbitant prices we had been reeling under till recently, says K.Satyavani, a consumer at the Kothapet Rythu Bazar.However, a few vegetables such as drumsticks and green chillies have become pricier due to paltry arrivals.High yieldRythu Bazars Chief Executive Officer M.K. Singh attributed the plummeting prices to the winter crop.Kothapet Rythu Bazaar, for instance, received 1,000 quintals of vegetables in a single day on January 12 as compared to the average arrivals of 470 quintals per day in July, 2013. The arrivals on some days reached up to 1,300 quintals too, informed Supervisor Padma.The Rythu Bazaars have an additional blessing, in vegetable cultivation being the primary occupation in many parts of the Ranga Reddy district. Mandals such as Shamshabad, Maheshwaram, Kandukur, Yacharam, Ibrahimpatnam, Shamirpet, Medchal, Shankarpally, Chevella, Moinabad and Vikarabad are known vegetable hubs."

9,"Rape, grime and punishment",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Doctor-in-the-House/rape-grime-and-punishment/,2014-01-19,The Times Of India,"Pause for a moment  youll hear a revolution in the air. This involves sex  speaking of it, debating, discussing, analysing it. It may seem absurd for provocative sexual discourse to have just begun in our antique, argumentative land. The West experienced this in the 1960s, which many of us know only through Forrest Gumps black and white clips. But Indias colonial experience made us hesitant about discussing sex  when a society hates its body for not being free, it doesnt discuss its pleasures or pains freely. The Gandhian experience added reticence  the Mahatmas confessions of guilt over sex led others to shy away, not from sex, but from talking about it.The result  huge sex crimes, like Partitions rapes, were painted with one broad brush as bad things, left undiscussed and unresolved. Crimes aside, the reluctance to depict even a consensual kiss had Indian cinema nervously showing bees bobbing in the breeze instead. Verbal mentions were unthinkable  words like rape couldnt be uttered without causing polite conversations to freeze. The results of such reticence were devastating, creating billions of Indians illiterate in sex and its rules, often suffering abuse but unable to say so  and no one listening.This is changing today. A new generations moving centre-stage, having experienced sex as education in co-ed schools, as condom ads and satellite TV scenes, through candy-tart chick-lit  where characters say orgasm more often than omelette  and provocative films, mobile phones and wardrobe malfunctions, pop music and porn. Through this discovery of what musicians Salt N Pepa call all the good things and bad things of sex, weve reached a crossroads.First, we are no longer painfully shy about discussing sex, particularly its bad things in public, manifest in anxiety about rape. Second, were seeing booming citizen activism, individual experiences becoming public concerns. Third, these two meet in multimedia, channels, journals and websites working in quick time. The result  a vibrant, noisy conversation encompassing empathy and hurt, one where the doubting can question women apparently maliciously screaming rape, while the logical retort, men can complain of harassment too.This is hugely positive  but there are dangers here. Think of Delhi law minister Somnath Bhartis recent late-night encounter with the Delhi police, the minister  who earlier named a rape victim  insisting the police raid a house allegedly containing prostitutes and drugs. When the police refused  they cant arrest women at night or search sans warrants  the ministers followers reportedly tackled the women themselves, forcing them into a car, heckling, slapping and taking them for medical tests. Now, think of the hectic scrutiny of recent high-profile rape and molestation cases, intimate accounts flooding the public sphere, cameras chasing alleged aggressors, zooming in for dramatic tremors of guilt.The two are extreme ends of the same anxiety, one impacting the powerful, the other, the vulnerable. Both show deep disregard for legal rules of privacy and protection every one of us is entitled to. In our anxious public conversations over sexs bad things, maintaining our balance is key. Swinging from reticence to wordiness  sometimes, sliding into voyeuristic grime  wont help. Neither will running roughshod over the law do.Speaking of which, as the Verma commission reports first anniversary nears, its time to calmly examine existing rape laws. Heres a query  do you remember five-year-old Gudiya in Delhi last year? Gudiya was lured by two neighbours promising her potato chips. She was tied-up  hauntingly, under her own home while her parents, a construction worker and his wife, searched frantically everywhere  and raped for days.Gudiyas assailants pushed plastic objects into her private parts, damaging her so severely, she needed five surgeries. Yet, her story melted quietly off the press. So did preoccupation with her masked assailants, awaiting judgment under amended rape laws. Following the Nirbhaya gang rape, the law finally recognised certain acts  acid attacks to trafficking  as serious crimes. But with innumerable Gudiya-like cases  reported child rape in Indias leapt by over 330% since 2001  the laws need further refinement.Rape involves both power and violence. The laws heavily punish those who violate their power or dominance over anyone. But like murder, rape involves several shades of grey, the darkest covering those to whom rape means sadism and torment, aiming to obliterate the victims humanity through delivering the most painful experience of it, producing what Slavoj Zizek calls second deaththe annihilation of natures cycle itself. Should these rapists get the same punishment as everyone else?Recognising different degrees of violence that compose rape is crucial. Imagining 10 years in jail might deter your office sleaze. But did it frighten the gang that raped a 51-year-old Danish tourist? Given our abysmal rape conviction rates  about 24%  will a 10-year sentence, delivered after yawning decades, deter repeat offenders like those in Shakti Mills? This approach is again too broad in its brush strokes. With the juvenile, allegedly most savage to Nirbhaya, walking free soon, will this leave us shouting over a few shame-faced celebrity heads?India has overcome great obstacles by finally talking about sex and recognising rape as a major crime. But now, rapes must be understood as crimes of variegated violence and given graded punishments, premeditation and savagery topping the list. For this, respecting the law remains vital. We cant let collective anxieties deteriorate into breathless grime  then, nothing can really be cleaned up."
10,Crash in tomato prices comes as a shock to farmers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/crash-in-tomato-prices-comes-as-a-shock-to-farmers/article5595421.ece,2014-01-20,The Hindu,"Farmers in Gubbi, Kunigal and Tumkur taluks decided to sow tomatoes in large tracts of land considering the skyrocketing vegetable prices. The three-and-a-half-month crop, they presumed, would mean good and quick returns.The crash in the tomato prices  to less than Re. 1 a kg  has come as a shock to them now. They say that it neither helps the farmer nor the consumer. While farmers in the villages of Tumkur district are getting 60 paise to 80 paise per kg of tomato, consumers in the city are buying it for around Rs. 10 per kg.Jayamma of Upparahalli told The Hindu : I went to buy tomatoes after I came to know that tomatoes are sold at 80 paise per kg, but I had to buy at Rs. 10 per kg. Nagappa of Mekharahalli in Sira taluk said that he was offered Rs. 10 per 20-kg carton of tomatoes and farmers had thrown tomatoes on the road at Bukapatna Circle in Sira taluk. My wife and I have to work as agricultural labourers in others fields to take care of our two children, he said.For farmers, the loss is cumulative. Vasanth Kumar and Roopa, farmer couple at Salagame in Hassan district, are hit by the tomato price crash even as they had not recovered from the loss they suffered after cultivating potato in the kharif season. They are now looking at tough times ahead, with three children to be educated. For routine expenses we are now dependant on two cows we have, said Ms. Roopa.Officials at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee expressed helplessness over these turn of events. Deputy Director of Marketing Department, APMC, Tumkur, M.C. Doreswamy, said: The rates of these perishable commodities is fixed based on the demand. Farmers, however, argue for greater regulation.

The farmers are of the view that they wont even recover what they spend on transporting the tomatoes to the market if they sold the crop at the current price.Many farmers in Hassan are already in dire straits after losing their potato crop during the kharif season this year.A few of them decided to cultivate tomato anticipating good returns as the prices of vegetables had gone up. But, by the time of harvesting, the price came crashing down to Re. 1 a kg. Tomato is being sold at Rs. 5 a kg in retail shops.Farmers have cultivated tomato in over 500 hectares in the district. Each farmer has spent between Rs. 75,000 and Rs. 1 lakh an acre. They are hopeful of getting back what they invested only if the crop is sold at Rs. 150 per bag of 15 kg.Wholesale merchants are offering only Rs. 20 a bag. We have to pay Rs. 6 to harvest 15 kg of tomatoes, a bag costs Rs. 4 and we have to spend another Rs. 10 per bag on transport. Carrying a bag of tomato to the market alone cost Rs. 20. What is the point of taking the risk when we are not sure of getting back what we spent,asked Venkate Gowda, a tomato grower in Salagame.He has spent more than Rs. 75,000 to cultivate tomato. Given the low prices in the market, he has not harvested the crop. Vasanth Kumar, another farmer in Salagame, decided to cultivate tomato for the first time this year.He spent over Rs. 50,000 to cultivate the crop in 30 guntas of land by taking loans. He also spent nearly 25,000 on fertilizer.No doubt, the yield was very good. The care I took to safeguard the crop resulted in good yield. However, after the prices crashed, I lost hopes of getting back what I spent, he said.Shakeel Ahmed, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department, said: The price of tomato normally goes down during this season. It may go up in April and May. However, there is no infrastructure available for farmers to store the crop till the prices go up."
12,A precious gift,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/personal-political/a-precious-gift/,2014-01-22,The Times Of India,"Last Sunday, a day before Kiran Soomros seventeenth birthday, there was a small party at her home in Gulshan-e-Hadeed, Karachi. A few friends gathered with her father Sikandar Ali Soomro, mother Shamshad, and five siblings to wish her for her special day as well as for her forthcoming heart operation in Bangalore.Haresh Jiwnani took over a chocolate cake and card on behalf of the members of the Aman ki Asha Facebook group. Early the next morning, he and another wellwisher, Jesrani Bimra, went to see off Kiran Soomro and her parents at the airport.Kiran has been able to hope, thanks to her Indian friend Nitu Jiwnanis appeal on the Aman ki Asha Facebook group a couple of weeks ago.I am an Indian and I want to save this Pakistani girl, wrote Nitu, a 26-year old classical dancer.Didi, Kiran would tell Nitu, I want to live. I dont want to die.The two had met in May 2013 when Kiran was Delhi for the heart surgery. However, doctors found her inoperable due to a severe lung infection and put her on medication for six months.The money the family had raised then, has since been spent. Soomro, a retired government servant, who makes a living selling potato chips at a roadside stall, didnt have the means to schedule the operation again.His adopted daughter Nitus appeal elicited an outpouring of support from Indians and Pakistanis around the world. She then contacted the famed heart surgeon Dr Devi Shetty, known for his compassionate approach, at his Naryana Hrudalya hospital in Bangalore. He examined Kirans medical reports, and promised to give her a massively discounted rate.Initially the question was, where to collect funds? Aman ki Asha is not an NGO and has no account for fund-collection. To the rescue came Dr Geet Chainani, a young medical doctor of Indian origin, who worked for nearly three years in Sindh with flood survivors, before returning recently to New Jersery, USA.Dr Chainani offered to allow her non-government organisation LifeBridge (which focuses on health in Sindh), to be used as a depository for funds. LifeBridge is a registered charitable organisation so donors can also get receipts certifying that their donations are tax-exempt.Contributions, large and small, came in from Indians and Pakistanis, including doctors, an art collector who auctioned off antique manuscript pages, and expatriate Indians moved by Kirans story. Within a few days pledges had come in for all the money required for the airfare and expenses in India.The Indian High Commission processed the visas in record time, on the condition that Aman ki Asha would take on more such cases. The Rotary-Aman ki Asha Heart to Heart programme has already enabled life-saving surgeries for some 200 minor children.Then Hilton Pharma agreed to sponsor the cost. Rotary International, India and Pakistan, said they would take care of medical expenses and hospitality in India. And Pakistan International Airlines waived the Karachi-Mumbai airfare. (Incidentally, PIA is the only airline that flies to all the capitals in the South Asian region). All the donors have generously requested the leftover money to be used for another deserving case rather than being returned to them.Its fantastic to see the collaborative efforts of Indians and Pakistanis achieve something so beautiful as a chance at life. Kirans got a ways to go but the warmth in her heart from all the love and support shes received will help to ease her journey, commented Dr Chainani. She hopes that Kiran will set a trend and a path for peacemongers.The journey on Jan 20 began with an unfortunate five-hour flight delay from Karachi (operational difficulties). PIA has apologized and promised to make it up. Nitu got the connecting flight to Bangalore changed to a late night one. She was at the airport to meet the Soomros when they finally landed in Mumbai.A skinny, exhausted, red-eyed Kiran clung to Nitu and wept. She didnt want to get on another flight. But after a breather and some refreshments, she was ready to tackle the onward journey. A journey towards health and happiness, pray her many well-wishers.Mumbai airport: Nitu (left) with Ammee Shamshad and Kiran. Photo: Sikander Ali SoomroA birthday cake and card from Aman ki Asha.

13,Kellogg India set to enter snacks business with Pringles,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Kellogg-India-set-to-enter-snacks-business-with-Pringles/articleshow/29225126.cms,2014-01-23,The Times Of India,"MUMBAI: This year, breakfast cereal maker Kellogg India would truly mirror its parent company's portfolio by venturing into the snacking category with Pringles, a bolt-on acquisition by Kellogg Company in the US two years ago.Bringing Pringles, an iconic American stacked potato chips brand, to India is not difficult for the company. The challenge for Kellogg India, which is trying hard to change the Indian consumer's breakfast habits to make it more ""healthy"", would be to market a snack product to the same consumer.""We globally talk about our vision on two platforms of nutrition and health. Pringles is a great product from the taste standpoint. Health wise, my logic is very simple: Everything that's had in the right quantity cannot be unhealthy,"" Sangeeta Pendurkar, MD, Kellogg India, told TOI.Pendurkar said the company would look at bringing Pringles to India this year. ""We want to get into the snack category at some point,"" she said, without commenting on a certain market rumour about Kellogg eyeing an Indian snack company.""We keep evaluating them from time to time,"" she said, when asked to comment specifically on whether Kellogg India was keen on acquiring an Indian snack company to bolster its portfolio.Pringles was acquired by the $15-billion Kellogg Company from Procter & Gamble and the objective was to make Kellogg a global snack player by building on its snacking capabilities. Emerging markets in particular, of the order of $2 billion, are expected to become a larger platform for Pringles.Pringles would once again pit the company against existing MNC rival PepsiCo in India. The two already compete in the Rs 700-crore odd breakfast cereal market, where it appears there's room for all. ""The opportunity is great in breakfast cereals because penetration is low,"" said Pendurkar.After struggling for 15-odd years in India, Kellogg has been growing at a healthy rate over the last five years or so. ""We have been in the market for two decades but have seen a lot of momentum in the last five-six years in terms of behavioural shifts. Consumers are becoming far more health conscious now and disposable incomes have gone up as well,"" she said.Awareness generation about breakfast eating, said Pendurkar, holds the key to unlocking the growth potential for the category. The company is banking on the fact that a large number of consumers (over 70%) skimp breakfast.That apart, Kellogg is leveraging another consumer behavioural shift towards out-of-home consumption. It has started a unique pilot in a tie-up with Meru Cabs in Mumbai, where passengers travelling in a Kellogg-branded Meru cab are offered a breakfast package, which is free of cost at present. So it's a breakfast on the go. Going by the response, Kellogg is planning to roll out the scheme across India.As for Pringles, the company will not have to struggle for two decades to get results. Snacking is intrinsic to the Indian consumption habit."

15,Vegetable rates crash but your bill will not be diced yet,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Vegetable-rates-crash-but-your-bill-will-not-be-diced-yet/articleshow/30070299.cms,2014-02-09,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: In the last one month, vegetables have become cheaper with their prices dropping by about 20%. In comparison to their rates at the same time in 2013, the fall has been steeper still with prices coming down by nearly 25% to 100%. For example, the price of bhindi (ladyfinger) in the wholesale market is currently Rs 200-230 per kg as against Rs220-240 a kg in the same period last year. Similarly, the price of brinjal is currently Rs 2 to Rs 6 per kg; it was Rs16 to Rs32 a kg at this time in 2013.Government officials claim that the income from vegetable has increased in comparison to last year. Good rains had encouraged farmers to sow vegetables. An official said that cultivation of vegetables this year was almost 18% higher than last year. In 2012-13, vegetables were cultivated in 1.94 lakh hectares during the rabi period. This had increased to 2.29 lakh hectares this year, a rise of 18%. Earlier, in 2012-13, with there being virtually no rain in parts of Gujarat, the vegetable harvest was low and this had led to a steep rise in their prices in the retail market, the officials said. In contrast, this year the state had good rains and this had encouraged farmers to go in for vegetable cultivation.Deepak Patel, secretary of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Ahmedabad, said that farmers are selling off their produce at low rates as vegetable production is expected to be very high this year. The farmers are not getting adequate prices for their produce.The case of onion farmers is the best example of this as an expected glut in the market is unlikely to fetch them any profit this year.The cost of sowing per kg of onion was around Rs 6 and the cost of transportation was around Rs 3-4 per kg. This meant the cost to the farmer per kg of onion was nearly Rs 10 per kg. However, onion farmers are getting just Rs 5-6 per kg for their produce. Their earnings are expected to fall further once the latest onion crop arrives in the market. Interestingly, vegetable prices have not registered the same fall in the retail market as has been seen in the wholesale market. Officials said potato, which was selling at around Rs 7-12 per kg in the wholesale market in mid-January, is now selling at Rs 5-8 per kg. In the retail market, however, potato prices currently range from Rs 10 to Rs 16 a kg while it was between Rs 16 and Rs 22 a kg in mid-January.The fall in vegetable prices has finally eased the financial burden on housewives. Rachana Patel, a resident of Gurukul, said: ""After nearly four months, vegetable prices are not upsetting domestic budgets anymore. We can now have salad and freely use onion and tomatoes in curry,"" she said.""I used to spend nearly Rs 600 on vegetables for four people for the entire week. Now this has come down to around Rs 400,"" said Rama Shah, a Satellite resident. She says that with the money saved from vegetable purchases, she can now purchase fruits as well. Earlier the entire budget for fruits and vegetables was used for purchasing only vegetables."

The wholesale traders are expecting this scenario to continue till the last week of February and expect a further dip.Attributing the dip in prices to the good local harvest of tomato, potato, green peas, cauliflower, onions, the traders said there has been a 30% dip in the prices of the vegetables in this season so far compared to February, 2013.""The main reason behind this is a good harvest due to a good monsoon. Last year the monsoon created mayhem and played a spoilsport to the crop. The dip in the wholesale prices is attributed to the cheaper prices in retail,"" said Radhey Shyam Phatak, a wholesale vegetable seller at Muhana Mandi on Tuesday.The price of onion, which had burnt holes in the common man's pocket during September-November 2013, has come down to Rs 11 per kg in the wholesale market and is sold at a price range of Rs 15-20 in the retail market.Traders said farmers in Sikar, Chomu, Sanganer, Bagru and nearby villages have got a bumper crop and due to which the supply of vegetables has increased manifold.""This February has been cheaper compared to 2013 as there is at least a 30% dip in the prices of vegetables. We are not dependent on onions, potato and tomato from Nasik as the local harvest is ample this time,"" said Abdul Saleem, another wholesale trader at the Muhana Mandi.Traders said the dip in the prices of vegetables will continue till the second week of March. ""Till March 15 we are expecting to get the same kind of supply, thus during this period the prices are not going to increase but there could be a further dip,"" Saleem added."

18,Plea to decontrol storage rent,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140214/jsp/bengal/story_17936632.jsp,2014-02-14,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Feb. 13: The Mamata Banerjee governments decision to continue with the Left Fronts policy of fixing cold storage rentals has come in the way of their modernisation, leaving consumers susceptible to sudden rise in the potato price, several owners said today. During the annual general meeting of the West Bengal Cold Storage Association  an umbrella organisation of cold storage owners  most participants urged the government to decontrol rents for the efficient running of the facilities. A cold storage owner explained the vicious cycle that the sector has been experiencing because of the governments policy of rent control. We earn very little margin because of the low rent fixed by the government. Because of the low rent, we cant generate enough surplus to invest in new technology for better storage. As the facilities are poor, the quantum of produce that can be stored is not enough, which results in price rise because of shortage in the market, a cold storage owner from Burdwan said at the meeting. The impact of poor storage facilities in Bengal is felt the most in October-December every year as the supply of potato in the market reduces and the price shoots up. This year, the price of potato reached Rs 25 a kg, forcing the government to intervene. But the most important step  decontrolling the rent  was overlooked, a senior government official said. He said although Bengal produced more than 100 lakh tonnes of potato every year, the storage capacity was only around 56 lakh tonnes. The states annual consumption requirement is 60 lakh tonnes. As a higher quantity of potato cannot be stored, the traders can easily control the supply chain, the official said. The problem faced by the cold storage owners is similar to bus and minibus operators, who, too, have to bear the brunt of the government deciding fares taking into account political considerations, not economic viability. The transport sector is struggling just like the cold storages. The government will never hike rents according to the requirements of the trade as it has elections on its mind, a cold storage owner alleged. The decision to continue with the rent-control policy has also come in the way of storage owners securing capital subsidy from the National Horticulture Board (NHB) to upgrade technology. According to the West Bengal Cold Storage Association, 60 per cent of the 458 cold storages in Bengal are at least 20 years old and need urgent technological upgrade to enhance their capacity. But this will require a huge investment. As the government fixes rents of cold storages, we dont get subsidy from the NHB, Rampada Paul, the president of the association, said during the annual general meeting today. The cold storage owners can secure 40 per cent incentives on capital cost from the NHB for upgrading the facilities if the government decontrols the rent. We had requested the government repeatedly to take steps to decontrol the rent but nothing has been done over the years, said another member of the association. According to Paul, the president of the association, the rent for storing one quintal of potato is Rs 120 a year. But it should be at least Rs 140 a quintal as the cost of electricity and labour has increased rapidly in the past one year, Paul said. Arup Roy, the agriculture marketing minister, told the cold storage owners during the meeting that they should submit an application stating their demands. I can understand that non-availability of NHB subsidy is a problem. If anything is a barrier, we will reconsider it, Roy said."
19,Pace of price rise drops to  8-month low,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140215/jsp/business/story_17940284.jsp,2014-02-15,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Feb. 14: The rate of wholesale price inflation eased to an eight-month low of 5.05 per cent in January as food prices cooled, bringing relief to policymakers struggling to rein in the price spike. The lower inflation rate can come as a breather for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which may decide not to hike interest rates further. In December, the WPI inflation stood at 6.16 per cent compared with 7.52 per cent in November. Persistently high inflation had prompted the RBI to raise key policy rates last month, the third hike since September last year, even as the countrys GDP growth rate is likely to be below 5 per cent in the current fiscal. Januarys inflation rate is the slowest since May 2013, when wholesale prices increased 4.58 per cent. Consumer inflation had also softened in January, falling to a near two-year low of 8.79 per cent. However, core WPI inflation inched up to 3 per cent last month, its highest level since April 2013, which is a cause for worry. Core inflation excludes the volatile components of inflation; the RBI considers non-food manufacturing inflation as core inflation. A. Prasanna, chief economist with ICICI Securities, said, There may still be some scope for food inflation to decelerate in the near term. However, core WPI inflation increased to 3 per cent in January from 2.8 per cent in December. But is this reason for comfort or despair? To the extent the long-period average for the series is closer to 5 per cent , the underlying price pressures may still be deemed comfortable. Inflation in food articles in January came down to 8.8 per cent against 13.68 per cent in the preceding month as vegetable prices fell 21.4 per cent month-on-month. Onion prices climbed 6.59 per cent in January compared with a 39.56 per cent increase in December. Potato prices climbed 21.73 per cent in January. Fruits were cheaper as also protein-rich items such as eggs, meat and fish. However, inflation in milk inched up slightly up to 7.22 per cent in January. Data released this week showed retail inflation to decline to a two-year low of 8.79 per cent in January, while industrial output in December shrank 0.6 per cent, prompting calls by industry for an interest rate cut to boost growth. Todays inflation figures have backed up their demand. The declining inflation should spur the RBI to revisit its monetary policy stance and cut rates, CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said."

At Bowenpally market, many farmers ended up throwing away their produce.The glut of vegetables, customary before the summer scarcity, has led to plummeting prices.Compared to prices a month ago, current rates have fallen, drastically for some vegetables such as brinjal, cauliflower and ladys finger.Brinjal, which cost Rs.12 per kg in local markets, and Rs.10 per kg in Rythu Bazars in February, is now available for Rs.6 to Rs.7 across Rythu Bazars.Officials say the price is in fact jacked up in Rythu Bazars, to shield farmers against the fall ing prices.At Bowenpally market, farmers are dumping the brinjal crop for as less as Rs.100 for a 50-kg bag. For some reason, rates at Rythu Bazars are maintained high, said Padma, supervisor at Saroornagar Rythu Bazar.Cauliflower on the other hand, costs Rs.8 per kg at Rythu Bazars, and is available for Rs.6 per kg at Bowenpally.

The contraction in IIP in December has been revised to 0.16 per cent from the provisional estimate of a dip of 0.6 per cent. Factory output contracted 1.6 per cent in October followed by a decline of 1.3 per cent in November. In January 2013, industrial output grew 2.5 per cent. The marginal improvement in the index of industrial production (IIP) was mainly on account of higher power generation and mining output even as manufacturing declined. The marginally positive IIP growth for January 2014 does not provide much comfort, given that both capital goods and consumer durables have contracted for yet another month. Moreover, the improved performance of consumer non-durables in January is supported by high growth in items such as vitamins and cashew kernels, which are not indicators of a pick-up in domestic consumption, Aditi Nayar, senior economist with Icra, said. Chandrajit Banerjee, director-general of CII, said, This is a small consolation considering that the manufacturing sector continues to be in the red for the fourth consecutive month, indicating the slowdown is yet to show any visible sign of bottoming out. Price watch The dip in retail inflation, aided by easing onion and potato prices, is likely to increase the clamour for a rate cut by the RBI in its next monetary policy. Overall inflation in the food basket, including beverages, slowed to 8.57 per cent in February from 9.9 per cent in the previous month. The rate at which vegetable prices increased eased to 14.04 per cent against 21.91 per cent in January. However, the recent hail and heavy rainfall that have damaged crops in many regions may cause a fresh price spike."

Bifurcation of the State has dealt a blow to the dreams of dozens of senior Congress leaders.The Congress has almost become an empty house in several constituencies with sitting members switching their loyalty to the TDP or YSR Congress. Among the 17 parliamentary constituencies in Coastal Andhra, not more than five or six sitting MPs may seek re-election in the coming elections.Already five expelled MPs have bid goodbye to the party and joined Jai Samaikyandhra Party of former Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy.Former Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao (Visakhapatnam) has already joined the TDP and his colleagues -- Shatrucharla Vijayarama Raju (Vizianagaram) and K. Parthasarathy (Krishna) -- are said to be looking at the TDP. In West Godavari, former Minister Pithani Satyanarayana has joined the Jai Samaikyandhra Party while Vatti Vasant Kumar has announced retirement. In Prakasam district, Maheedhar Reddy is holding consultations with his aides to take a final call. He is unlikely to contest on a Congress ticket.The loyalistsOnly P. Balaraju (Visakhapatnam), Botcha Satyanarayana (Vizianagaram), Kondru Murali Mohan (Srikakulam), Thota Narasimham (East Godavari), Anam Ramanarayana Reddy (Nellore), Kasu Venkatakrishna Reddy and Dokka Manikya Varaprasad (both Guntur) have reposed faith in the Congress party. The situation is worse in some districts where Congress MLAs have already joined the TDP or the YSR Congress.Defections, in fact, had begun a year ago when a dozen and odd MLAs had switched their loyalties to the YSR Congress. As the bifurcation appeared certain, the rate of defections picked up momentum.As regards Lok Sabha, Killi Krupa Rani (Srikakulam), Botcha Jhansi (Vizianagaram), Kishore Chandra Deo (Araku), M. M. Pallam Raju (Kakinada), K. Bapiraju (Narsapur) and Panabaka Lakshmi (Bapatla) are likely to contest on Congress tickets. Others like Vundavalli Aruna Kumar (Rajahmundry), Sabbam Hari (Anakapalli), G.V.Harsha Kumar (Amalapuram) and Lagadapati Rajagopal (Vijayawada) joined the Jai Samaikyandhra Party.Former Union Minister Kavuri Sambasiva Rao is said to be exploring possibility of changing party while Daggubati Purandeswari has already joined the BJP.Rayapati Sambasiva Rao (Guntur), who was initially with Kiran Kumar Reddy has hinted at returning to the Congress. Ongole MP Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy is not likely to seek re-election on Congress ticket.No winning candidatesParty sources say in many constituencies, Congress leaders have to look out for new candidates.In private senior leaders lament that it is next to impossible to choose candidates with winning chances as the voter apathy towards the Congress is so strong that even seasoned leaders are reluctant to enter the fray."
28,Chips n chaps,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Masquerader/chips-n-chaps/,2014-03-23,The Times Of India,"It is just as well the silicon chip and Microsofts Satya Nadella entered the arena a month earlier. Just a few days ago, Andhras Nellore got a modest investment for one of the cola plants and added facilities for snacks  your favorite couch potato chips. The other cola will be having similar facilities soon. Economic cooperation between the two big democracies started even prior to the elections. The opening trend seems to be in a healthy sequence. Silicon chips seem to be more important for us. Soon it may cover all that comes between intellectual and gustatory chips.The real activity that one may like to notice is not the many garlanded and colorful national figures, each taking on the other, stature to stature, and weight to weight (Jaitley vs Capt Amrinder), but the parallel black and white columns that talk of a telecom major taking over another, a truck manufacturing major going for a joint venture with a major international, and once again the US FDA ticking off quality issues on Indian patent generics. Big trade is chugging off from static platforms. Big trade-offs, naturally will carry on pari passu.As a flashback, groping memories a few years ago, was something of this nature in the offing, but somehow halted in the tracks? I believe President Obamas first visit to Mumbai came with an unconcealed statement that he would like to have a $20bn trade deficit with India to prop up the US economy at that time. He did not shy away from stating his trade motives. It was as straight as the US can ever be. One does not know what actually transpired between financial negotiations and subsequent political interactions in New Delhi, but the country later fell under a huge scam, etched in history as 2G. That was the beginning of a series of scams that gradually depleted the public confidence in UPA II.Trade and diplomacy are the essential powers of a sovereign nation. That is the starting point of any negotiation. What transpires during discussions and is perceived as an end point, is how deep are the pockets, and how powerful the muscles that flex that joint? Was there a miscalculation between India Inc. and political India then? Was a very direct issue with a major ally perceived as an opportunity to exercise ones snobbish option to concede or to set aside. Could diplomacy not see that an instant agreement could be bargained for extra favors for the continuity of such onoing transactions in the future?One need not comment, but finally with the American major Verizons buyout of its 45% stake in Vodafone at $130 (approx $13bn) and Microsofts buyout of Nokia handsets division for a sum close to $8bn, (that makes up the $20bn) American businesses finally took up very rationally a place in the Indian telecom arena, with an inevitable expansion into Asia! Only it came so many years late. The currency hit rock bottom, and India was almost to be rated as a junk economy.Many in this country are viewing these elections as a fight between decades-old, Indias partially unsolved problems with its polity. That in a way is unavoidable. Elections are fought at base levels. True or exaggerated divides are essential to bring forth likes and dislikes as the real energizers. They have a utility, for so much is done without much payment if a common man is motivated by his own moral correctitude. The essence of the game of an electoral exercise is too subtle for him to see. That issues of discounts on water and electricity, and the injustice to the humble auto-walla were sufficient to bring down a government in a capital has so astonishingly been shown by Mr Kejriwal. Just having done it once for a month, having shown his presence in his dug-out dharnas, and persisting with his maroon sweater, has etched his performances in a certain section of the polity. It requires a certain cleverness to attract the uninitiated into your chosen path of initiation.This election is all about the future financial policy of this country, and most certainly how it deals with the powers that dictate finance across the globe. It is time India took its ticket to participate in the track and field events of the worlds economic Olympiad. It may have to handle the casuistry of its previous socialist and non-aligned mode. Those were no minor movements by any means, but cannot be an excuse not to go for a hop, step and jump, the way todays economics runs.The burden of performance of the government that comes to power is how well it can negotiate for a larger good for a longer run. Business equations by elite minds, matching trade diplomacy by the government, that approves or modulates, is of essence. Negotiations between un-equals may often look as sell-outs, and sell-outs they might well be, if sufficient spadework is lacking. One way to work towards a win-win situation is to know your strengths for being invited to the table. For todays economy, india has some essential cards to play. The way they are priced and bargained will not just be good for us, it will also raise the esteem before the negotiator.Here begins the game of the big chaps. Sectors where India has a strong base to reckon with, and where it may ask for extra sops to be able to consolidate and contribute, are software, pharma, and health care. The story of these sectors is pretty much the same  a good start and sufficient proof of talent, but finally a stunted growth, due to internal policies, and lack of essential treaties that may spurt meaningful growth as product leaders and innovators. Garnering a few jobs, and bagging back-office business of other corporates, is not what will be lucrative long enough. In the software sector, India still has to come out with a world-beating product. We do need that extra bit of investment and groomed talent to come out with world-competing brands. This may be a major point where a future government can put its bucks, or invite more bucks and relevant experience.We have the label of being the worlds largest manufacturers of generics. It is credit to this industry that grew without much government help. The larger Indian companies produce reasonable quality drugs, at unimaginatively low prices. This is a sector no one can ignore. Quality issues being raised in the larger markets are understandable, and the government can do much to join a universal quality forum, install world standard quality assessment centers, and assure that every drug sent across the seas has the same quality standards as anywhere else. The investments and procedures required in a mega-billion trade may force foreign interests and approvals that may not come without giving in to foreign holdings. The need to part with holdings may be coupled with state of the art R&D centers. The government will have this wise duty to perform. Equal is the need to advocate Indian approach to patent laws in pharma. Since drugs are unaffordable to more than two-thirds of the worlds population, India may have enough ammo to argue out its stance, and yet work on a system of expensive R&D that goes in discovering a molecule, continues to be an incentive for the innovators.Healthcare, at recognized centers is quite standard and still about 10 per cent the cost as anywhere else. This window of opportunity needs to be cashed upon, for soon no country would be safe if another is epidemic ridden. It is time to balance commercial gains, and let a healthy humanity survive. Can the new government hire such visionaries within and without to set a new world policy on disease and its affordability? Can Indian thinktanks be kindled to give thought and substance to the Universal Health Affordability Act. It may sound another countrys problem, but it has more pressing needs in the developing world. Most private sector hospitals are American Joint Commission approved. They are eligible to take patients funded by international insurance companies. A rational growth stimulus, not compromising quality may be required.As a derivative of the above, and as a theme this country has pondered but rarely followed is the growing need of world class education in the said sectors, to bring in a crop of fresh talent to carry on from where we have reached. Education, be it medical, technical, or managerial asks for huge individual investments for entrance, qualification, and certification. It is becoming beyond the reach of the middle classes that generally provide the talent. The quality of education presently is somewhere close to quackery. Huge investments are required here, or the aforesaid gains may just fade away. Well equipped private hospitals with distinguished faculty may partly take on this task through selection by the national Boards. It works out well. No capitation fees, and you earn as you learn.Whats a good give and take? I learnt from my patient, a certain Mr Gupta. He was standing at the door of a train compartment along with another passenger. The other one happened to drop his slipper as the train suddenly picked speed. Mr Gupta immediately took hold of his other foot and threw the other slipper out too.I shall explain his logic as told to me. He pacified his co-passenger by telling him that once he had lost one slipper it was of no use to him. By letting the other go immediately, at least the farmer in that field may find another pair of slippers which he never had.I learnt that at times an apparent loss can be an absolute gain in a broader perspective.Yes it is about chips to be exchanged, and the chaps astute enough to work out gains on either side.Easter is round the corner. Offering the other cheek so far had moral values to it. Today, it may even have commercial ones!"
29,Vegetable prices inch up,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vegetable-prices-inch-up/article5824540.ece,2014-03-24,The Hindu,"As winter stock of vegetables dwindles, the prices of a few of them have begun to show slight variations over the past week. The cost of ginger has begun to touch Rs.100 a kilogram at retail stores in the city, and its wholesale price is currently Rs.80. Tomatoes cost Rs.15 at certain outlets at Connemara Market but their price varies depending on the quality. Murukesh, who runs a retail store at Sasthamangalam, says that the juicier ones now cost between Rs.22 and Rs.25 while the small, local varieties are on sale for less than Rs.15-17.The price of cluster beans, which also increased since February, is in the Rs.40-Rs.50 range now. This is noticeable because it had gone down to an all-time of low of Rs.28 a month ago, said Murukesh. The price of onions, which made many a consumer shed a tear across the country in November 2013, has receded to Rs.20. Kerala was relatively shielded during the time with the price never crossing Rs.55.The cost of brinjal has also marginally gone up from Rs.15 to Rs.20 now. This, according to vendors, is the sign of an early summer. The wholesale price of potatoes in Chala and Palayam markets is Rs.24 and Rs.26 in retail stores. The cost of okra has also seen an increase from Rs.24 to Rs.30 at stores in Palayam. In some retail stores it costs nearly Rs.40. This is expected to come down once the next harvest arrives in the market, vendors say.Considering how hot it already is, we have reason to worry about the next few months. If it rains at least intermittently in April and June, the harvest should not be overly affected, said K. Shibu, a vendor at Connemara.Rejitha, a resident of Vattapara, who was shopping at his store in Palayam, says she usually buys from Horticorp stores because of the subsidies they provide, a relief in times of sharp hikes.Changing needsWholesale stores have lost their sheen, Shibu adds, with the government introducing Haritha stalls and Horticorp outlets across the city. It is either that or the small retail stores in their neighbourhoods or the retail giants and supermarkets. Very few come to wholesale markets like Palayam or Chala, he says, adding that they have long supplemented their stores with non-traditional products such as spring onions, chou chou, capsicum, lettuce, red cabbage, and celery to cater to changing market needs.A lot of north Indians demand them, he said, recalling how seven years ago, cultivators in Tamil Nadu had given such items for free in a bid to build a market for them."
30,Modi sits on fence on GM food ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140324/jsp/nation/story_18112446.jsp,2014-03-24,Telegraph,"Dabhadi, March 23: Narendra Modi has cleaved an opening in the farm fence, just as he has left ajar the door to the retail store. Modi last week took his advocacy of genetically modified (GM) crops to a Vidarbha belt scarred by farmers suicides but skirted a direct question on his stand on the infusion of the technology into food crops. At a Chai pe Charcha interaction with a group of farm widows and family members in Dabhadi, a village in Maharashtras Yavatmal district, a farmer asked Modi if he would introduce Bt brinjal, the genetically modified version of the vegetable. Modi, whose government had opposed field trials of Bt brinjal though it supports GM commercial crops, ducked the question. He gave a general reply in line with his carefully crafted public positions on contentious policies such as foreign direct investment in retail. Modi has given an impression that he is in favour of FDI in retail, which the BJPs trader vote bank opposes, without either explicitly saying so or closing the door on room for manoeuvre in future. On Thursday, Modi said there were different opinions on GM technology. But Bt cotton immensely benefited farmers in Gujarat and even in some parts of Maharashtra, he added. I am all for technology, Modi said. We should not discard a technology that helps farmers; we must have faith in science . We must put technology and science to use, with regulations, and add value to produce. GM crop is a controversial topic. Although GM cotton has been cultivated across the country for over a decade, India has not approved commercial cultivation of any GM food crop yet. Confined field trials have been permitted for some food crops like brinjal, potato and mustard. While a government panel of experts had recommended cultivation of GM brinjal, former environment minister Jairam Ramesh had blocked the move after consultations with sections of scientists and anti-GM activists. The Union agriculture ministry as well as the department of biotechnology are in favour of cultivation of GM food crops but the Centre has not taken a decision because of the sensitivities involved. It is against this backdrop that Modi has pitched for science and technology in farming. The BJP-run governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh had stoutly opposed field trials of GM crops two years ago, joining others such as Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Rajasthan. In the 2009 election manifesto, the BJP had said that if it came to power, no genetically modified seed will be allowed for cultivation without full scientific data on long-term effects on soil, production and biological impact on consumers. All food and food products produced with genetically modified seeds will be branded as GM Food. In a resolution on agriculture during a national executive meeting in Mumbai in May 2012, the BJP had asked the central government to immediately impose a moratorium on GM crops in the country because they will not increase productivity. The crops will pollute traditional seeds through cross-pollination, the resolution added. Several farmers organisations in Vidarbha have been vehemently opposed to the adoption of GM crops, saying Bt cotton has added to the growing list of causes that have made farming non-remunerative. The opposition stems from a feeling that Bt cotton pushed up the production cost dramatically but did not result in a commensurate rise in productivity. Nearly 97 per cent of cotton grown in Vidarbha is rain-fed, or grown in non-assured irrigation conditions, according to studies by the Maharashtra government. Scientists feel that Bt cotton is more suited for areas where farmers have assured irrigation from wells or canals. Several farm groups are also opposed to Bt cotton because of the growing domination of multinational corporations in the seed and input markets. In the hailstorm and incessant rains that have affected 40 lakh hectares across several states, the standing winter crops in Dabhadi were also devastated. At least nine farmers had committed suicide in the village over the past 10 years. Agriculture is in a serious condition and any calamity leaves the farmers devastated, Modi said. But taking the extreme step is not a solution; we will fight together to overcome the crisis, he said. Vidarbhas cotton growing areas have seen over 11,000 farm suicides in the past 10 years. Over 300,000 farmers had committed suicide between 1997 and 2012, according to the national crime records bureau (NCRB). Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh are among the big states with the highest incidence of suicides. Proponents of biotechnology in agriculture have long cited Indias land constraints, climate change challenges, and rising demand for food as reasons to pursue GM crops. They point out that GM food crops such as maize, papaya, and canola have been grown in many countries for several years and the global cultivated area under GM crops has had an annual growth rate of 6 per cent. OUTSIDER BRAWL A war of words has broken out between Amritsar rivals Arun Jaitley and Amarinder over who is a son of the soil Jaitley: Despite my ancestral roots in Punjab, Captain Sahib (Amarinder) called me an outsider and a pseudo Punjabi. Will he be kind enough to tell me which statein India does (Congress President) Mrs Sonia Gandhi belong to? Amarinder: I always thought Jaitley was a gentleman, but I am sorry to read about his shameless attempts to question the statehood of Gandhi.... But let me remind Jaitley of our great Indian culture and tradition which accept the daughters-in-law as the real inheritors of the house and not the daughters, irrespective of which place they come from. Jaitley: The blood of Amritsar is running in my veins. Then how can I be an outsider?My grandparents belong to Amritsar and I spent my childhood in the holy city. Amarinder: Jaitleys newfound love for his Punjabi roots is sheer opportunism. And let Mr Jaitley tell me when he last visited Punjab, leave aside contesting an election from here. Jaitley: Will he ever be available to the people of Amritsar at all? His availability is only for a few hours since, otherwise, his palace is always inaccessible to the common man. Amarinder: I dont want to say as to whose accessibility should be questioned: the one who has been in electoral politics for the last four and a half decades or the one who has always chosen backdoor entry to the legislature (a reference to Jaitleys Rajya Sabha route till now)."
31,Onion farmers shed old techniques for high yield,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Onion-farmers-shed-old-techniques-for-high-yield/articleshow/33091409.cms,2014-04-02,The Times Of India,"NASHIK: Balu Darade, a farmer from Dodi Budruk, is reaping the benefit of adopting new farming techniques with a bumper onion crop this season. He is among thousands of farmers from Nashik district, who have gained through the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) pilot project training programme.Last November, he implemented the newly learnt techniques of drip irrigation, raised bed and better pest and disease control on three of his seven-acre plot to cultivate onion. He shed the traditional techniques of sowing on flat ground and using hybrid seeds, fertilizers.""I received 195 quintal onion production per acre, almost double the 100 quintals I would grow per acre till now. I sold the produce at a rate of Rs 950 per quintal at Dodi and Nandur Market,"" said the elated 45-year-old.Apart from the good yield, the new techniques helped him save labour cost for irrigation, fertilizer application and removal of weeds. He saved almost Rs 6,000 per acre. Next year, he plans to cultivate onion on the entire seven-acre area with drip irrigation.The Nabard pilot project on onion value chain management in Nashik district has given farmers twice the yield that they had last year. Sinnar, Yeola and Deola talukas, where onions are grown, were chosen for the pilot project.Nabard had appointed Yuva Mitra, a Sinnar-based non-governmental organisation, as the co-ordinating agency to carry out this project. The agency trained the onion farmers with respect to scientific methods of growing and storing onions. The farmers were trained about all aspects of onion cultivation, from proper sowing methods to harvesting, in November 2013.The training programme is part of Nabard's project on cash crops, including onion, potato and tomato, that often have fluctuating rates resulting in the farmer getting either good value for his crop and heavy losses. The project was started to increase the production and quality of onions and consequently establishing good sale of the crop.""Forty four percent of onion crop in the country is grown in Maharashtra. The economy of the district majorly depends on onion cultivation. But due to traditional methods of growing and storing onions, 40% of the onions rot,"" said Sunil Pote, founder of Yuva Mitra.He added: ""Good quality seeds are also not available. Hybrid seeds affect the production and quality of onions. Loss in sale of onions is seen regularly. That is why value chain management of onion was started.""The farmers first used the new methods of growing and storing onion after the training in November. ""Traditional methods like growing onions on flat bed were replaced by raised bed so that water could be supplied through drip irrigation. The temperature can also be maintained in raised bed sowing. Spacing between two onions and the two rows of onions can be maintained well with this method of sowing,"" said Shital Dange, a volunteer of Yuva Mitra.""In traditional methods of storing, farmers make heaps of onion under the trees, in cow sheds, or even in a corner of their houses and 40% of the onions are spoilt due to weather conditions. Nabard will be giving loans to farmers with minimum interest to set up proper storage facility for onions,"" said the volunteers.Karbhari Shinde, a 65-year-old farmer, would get 50 quintal per acre on his 11-acre plot. He tried the new method to cultivate onion on two acres of land. He got more than 70 quintal onion production per acre and sold it at the rate of Rs 900 per quintal at Dodi market.""My onion yield has increased by 50 quintal per acre as compared with last year,"" he said.Uttam Khule, a farmer from Vadangali, said, ""We saved around 30% of water and fertilizers and the yield of onions has increased. We saved labour charges as well.""The Vadangli gram panchayat has made available one acre of land for onion marketing activity. Green Vision Company formed by member farmers of the project is going to develop the land and after the construction work is completed, onion marketing centre will be managed through Green Vision, said Ramnath Thorat, another farmer from Pathare Budruk said.Farmers' groups, cluster groups at society level establishedMonthly meetings of these groups are conductedTraining programmes on onion cultivation through scientific approach, objective of the project and role of the society are providedVadangali: 25 acresBhatgaon: 15 acresPathre: 15 acresJalgaon Neur: 45 acresDodi: 40 acresNiphad: 70 acresSurvey of onion crop growers in the project was conducted for detailed information about the market rate, market conditions and quantity of onion, market survey was undertaken to understand current market situation of onion crop.

According to analysts, this could stop the Reserve Bank of India from easing interest rates to prop up the economy amid fresh signs of a slowdown. Inflation in food items, based on the wholesale price index (WPI), shot up 9.9 per cent in March from 8.12 per cent in the previous month. Overall WPI inflation fell to a nine-month low of 4.68 per cent in February. Consumer price inflation in March spiked to 8.31 per cent, driven by higher food prices, from 8.03 per cent in the previous month. Food prices in March rose 9.10 per cent from a year earlier, faster than Februarys provisional 8.57 per cent rise. According to data released by the government today, January WPI inflation has been revised to 5.17 per cent against an earlier estimate of 5.05 per cent. In March, potato prices rose 27.83 per cent against 8.36 per cent in the previous month. Inflation in onion was 1.92 per cent compared with a contraction in February. Overall inflation in the vegetable segment was 8.57 per cent against around 4 per cent in February. Fruits were costlier by 16.15 per cent in March compared with 9.92 per cent in the previous month. The government said the build-up in inflation rate in 2013-14 was 5.7 per cent compared with 5.65 per cent in the earlier fiscal. A sharper-than-expected moderation in vegetable prices in the past three months had raised hopes of a respite. However, recent unseasonal hail and heavy rains in some parts of the country damaged crops and drove up food prices again. Mangoes are likely to be expensive this year as the overall domestic production is estimated to decline by up to 20 per cent than last years level of 18 million tonnes because of crop damage in some states, industry association Assocham said today. RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has raised the repo rate to 8 per cent from 7.25 per cent since September to curb inflation. However, he left borrowing costs unchanged in the last review on April 1 and said further tightening was not anticipated if consumer-price increase stayed on path to hit 8 per cent in January 2015 and 6 per cent a year later. CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said, Demand in the economy is weak, as is evident from all indicators of growth."

36,Pricey veggies do a poll vault ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140417/jsp/jharkhand/story_18218252.jsp,2014-04-17,Telegraph,"Ranchi, April 16: Healthy eating is both within your reach and beyond this election season. The paradox lies in the price of vegetables and fruits, which are being curiously affected because commercial vehicles have been pulled away for poll duty. While vegetables have become remarkably cheaper in wholesale markets because there are no trucks to send local produce to other states, fruits are acting pricey because they are mostly brought in from the western and southern parts of the country. Md Hasim of Hasim Bhola & Co.  a prominent wholesaler at Daily Market, Ranchi, explained the quirky phenomenon. Since trucks have been seized for the elections, the vegetable bowls of Ranchi such as Kanke, Bero, Mandar as well as those of Lohardaga and Gumla districts are unable to sell their produce outside. So, prices have dropped by almost 50 per cent in about a week. On the other hand, fruits mostly come from outside and hence, the pocket pinch, which will last for another month or so, he said. Highlighting wholesale prices, he further said: We were selling kaddu (pumpkin) at Rs 14 a kg and the current price is Rs 5-7. Similarly, the rate of other vegetables are fluctuating too (see box). He added that normally a chunk of this local produce is sent to Bihar and Bengal, besides Jharkhands Hazaribagh. Dasrath Sahu, a vegetable vendor at Lalpur, corroborated Hasim. Potato cost Rs 16/kg in wholesale and Rs 18/kg in retail. Now, you are getting it at Rs 12/kg (wholesale) and selling it at Rs 14/kg (retail). The pricey onion was Rs 18/kg. In the wholesale market, it is Rs 14/kg now, he said. Sahu, however, added that the dip in wholesale rates did not always guarantee a fall in retail prices. Reasons there are two. First, since the poll effect is temporary, retail vendors dont slash prices and try to earn more profit. Second, retail prices depend on immediate circumstances. For instance, vegetables sell at their highest rate during midday and lowest in late evening, he explained. While the polls have somewhat humbled vegetables, fruits continue to act pricey. Sudhir  owner of Sudhir Fruit Sales, a wholesale outlet in Harmu  said they were incurring heavy expenses in ferrying consignments. A truck from Nasik (Maharashtra) and fruit baskets of Andhra Pradesh is charging anything between Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000. The wholesale price of Fuji apple is Rs 140/kg; at retail, it is selling at Rs 150-160. Red apple varietys wholesale cost is Rs 170-180/kg and in retail over Rs 200/kg, Sudhir said, adding that every fruit had scaled the wholesale price ladder by Rs 15-20 per kg."

While onion prices in the past week have gone up by Rs 2 to Rs 14 a kilo, the tuber is being sold at Rs 18 a kilo, an increase of Rs 6 since the last week, sources said.Trucks that were used to supply the vegetables were engaged in election duty, one of the reasons for short supply. Bad weather in potato-producing states also contributed to the shortfall.Official sources said the prices of potato would continue to rise for another three months. It may go up to Rs 40 per kg. The horticulture department attributed the price rise to damage to potato cultivation in potato-rich states on which Odisha is dependent to meet its requirement.""Hail storms and intermittent bad weather in Punjab, parts of UP and Maharashtra, have led to a short supply of potato in the state,"" said horticulture director Sanjeev Chaddha. He said the state government had been apprised of the situation.Official sources said the state produces 3 lakh metric tonne of potato per year against the requirement of 9 lakh metric tonne. ""We have to procure about 6 lakh metric tonne of potato from other states to meet the requirement. This time, we are getting around 3 lakh tonnes less potato from outside,"" said Chaddha.Bhubaneswar requires about 400 tonnes (40 trucks) of potato a day, said Gayadhar Swain, general secretary of Rajdhani Haata Byabsayi Sangha.He said the supply chain had been disrupted because trucks used for transporting potato had been requisitioned for election duty.""About 200 trucks were requisitioned for election duty. In the past week, hardly 50 trucks of potato have come to the city, whereas in a week, 300 trucks of potato should be delivered here,"" said Swain. He said onion prices had not increased significantly.""The slight increase in onion prices can be attributed to panic buying by consumers,"" he said.Potato price had touched Rs 80 in October 2013 leading to panic buying. The food supply and consumer welfare (FSCW) department had seized about 2,900 packets of potato from a cold storage on the outskirts of the city and supplied 550 quintals for sale to various fair price shops.""The supply and horticulture department should tell consumers that this situation will prevail for another three months, otherwise vendors will take undue advantage of it,"" said Minaketan Bhoi, a consumer."

In some parts of city, people have already resorted to panic buying.The department attributed it to damage to crops in major potato-growing states.The CPI and the Samajwadi Party have criticized the state government for rise in prices. CPI workers on Sunday took out a rally here, protesting the hike. Some of them wearing garlands made of potato and onion demonstrated at Rajmahal Square. The party's zonal secretary Sura Jena alleged that ruling BJD collected huge sums from onion and potato wholesalers for the elections. Samajwadi Party state president Rabi Behera demanded raids on godowns.The present scenario rekindles memories of potato crisis in November last year when the vegetable became a luxury with price spiraling to unprecedented Rs 80-90 a kg, triggered by short supply from West Bengal (WB). Even CM Naveen Patnaik had sought intervention of his WB counterpart Mamata Banerjee. The common man's vegetable has registered a hike of Rs 6 compared to last week's sprice of Rs 12 a kg, Unit I vegetable market sources said. While onion was selling at Rs 12 a kg last week, the price has gone up by Rs 2.Further increase in price of the edible bulb may bring tears in eyes of customers."

Traders, on the other hand, claimed that that the situation was normal and people need not be worried. Over the past few days, potato and onion prices have gone up by Rs 5 to Rs 6 a kilo triggering panic. In October after Phailin, the two vegetables had disappeared from the market. The price of potato, which was Rs 10 a kilo a couple of weeks ago, is now sold at Rs 18 and onion, which cost around Rs 10 a kilo, has touched Rs 20 a kilo. On Monday, food and supply secretary Madhusudan Padhee instructed the district administration to keep a tab on the market. The collectors have been told to check the stocks in their districts and see that the price did not go up, said Padhee. Sudhakar Panda, secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha, said there was no scarcity of these vegetables and people need not be worried. Panda said that the cyclone and the subsequent shortage of vegetables encouraged more production this time, but its not enough for the Odisha market. But now, we are getting potato and onion from farmers of Bengal directly. The price of potato is Rs 1,120 plus Rs 150 a quintal for transportation and its sold in Odisha between Rs 1,250 and Rs 1,280. The market rate is fixed accordingly, said Panda, adding that the situation was same for onion. He said that due to requisitioning of several trucks for the elections, transportation charge has gone up affecting the rate marginally. Besides, cold store products have not come to the market and they will come by the first week of May. These things will reduce the prices to a certain amount. The wholesale traders said with the temperature hovering around the 40C mark, no one would dare to hide these easily perishable products. There might be some retail traders with vested interests who have been knowingly raising the price to create instability. But we are trying our level best not to hike the price, said a member of the wholesale traders association. In Cuttack, a meeting between district officials and wholesale and retail traders will take place tomorrow to review the situation, availability of stock as well fixation of prices, said Collector Girish S.N, adding that the traders at Chhatrabazar had been instructed to sell potatoes at Rs 16 a kilo. Potato will be sold at Rs 15 at four model fair price shops from tomorrow."

Meanwhile, the district civil supply officers conducted raids for the second day on Wednesday at local Malgodown, the biggest wholesale market of the State, to crackdown on hoarding. Similarly, the administration has thrown open its four fair price shops in the city selling potatoes at Rs. 13.50 a kg.The district collector on the day also had a discussion with the traders to find out ways to control the prices of these essential items. Traders were of the opinion that the stock of these two items in the State have already exhausted and they are depending on outside markets to procure them.Due to sudden increase in demand of potatoes, the farmers in West Bengal are selling it at a premium causing the cascading price hike at retail shops, said a trader of Malgodown dealing with potatoes. He however, was optimistic that the situation would improve within a week or so when the stuffs from the cold stores hit the markets."

The total potato market in India is estimated at around 43 million tonnes and about 10 per cent is used as seeds by farmers, the statement said. Thus the potential of seed potato market is more than 4 million tonnes, of which only 0.25 million tonnes is now organised. While the organised sector is growing at 15-17 per cent, the overall seed potato industry is expected to grow around 6 per cent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR).In a statement, Ashok Sharma, CEO, Agri & Allied Businesses, M&M, said, to further grow this business, we will require special technology and will also need to put in some investments in the supply chain.On the joint venture he said, Not only will this help in our quest for delivering farmer prosperity through agronomy and better technology but will also open up global market, thus providing our farmers with better returns."

""The conditions and molecules found in the earth's ancient oceans assisted and accelerated the interconversion of metabolites that in modern organisms make up glycolysis and the pentose-phosphate pathways  two of the essential and most centrally placed reaction cascades of metabolism,"" explained Markus Ralser from department of biochemistry at University of Cambridge.A reconstruction of earth's earliest ocean in the lab revealed the spontaneous occurrence of the chemical reactions used by modern cells to synthesise many of the crucial organic molecules of metabolism. Previously, it was assumed that these reactions were carried out in modern cells by metabolic enzymes.Why breast cancer often spreads to lungs revealedResearchers have why breast cancer often spreads or metastasizes to the lung.In this paper, the researchers developed an innovative ex vivo (outside the living organism) model system that simulates different organ environments.They observed that breast CSCs have a particular propensity for migrating towards and growing in the lung, and they identified specific interactions between breast CSCs and lung-derived proteins that could be disrupted to reduce the metastatic behavior of breast cancer.Alison Allan, PhD, a scientist at Western University and the Lawson Health Research Institute said that in metastasis, theres a theory called the seed and soil hypothesis.Analogous to a dandelion, when it goes to seed, the seeds blow all over the place. But they dont necessarily grow everywhere they land; they grow only in congenial soil that has the right nutrients that support growth of seeds in a foreign environment. In the situation of metastasis, the tumor cells (seeds) have some inherent factors that determine their aggressiveness and ability to metastasize, while the different organs (soil) are believed to provide important factors that attract tumor cells to particular organs and help support their survival and growth into metastatic tumors, explains Allan, an associate professor in the Departments of Oncology, and Anatomy and Cell Biology at Westerns Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry.A lot of research has been done on the cancer cells because theyre easy to study, but not a lot has gone into understanding the soil factor. Weve uncovered some specific proteins that are produced in the lung that seem to interact with cancer stem cells, making the lungs a congenial place for cancer cells to grow.Not keeping fit? Blame it on your genetic cellsIn what could cheer the couch potatoes a bit, researchers have now found that genetic cells in our bodies keep changing and they could influence our health in numerous ways, agencies report from Toronto.Genomes are changing, not just from generation to generation, but even within our individual cells.The researchers found an association between the level of modification of RNA and our basal metabolic rate the rate at which we are able to convert food into energy to power our bodies.If DNA is the printing press that determines the functions of a living organism, RNA is the print that it leaves behind.Modifications to the RNA of the mitochondria might be influencing your fitness, discovered the researchers.Mitochondria are the power stations of our cells, and the more power a cell needs, such as a muscle cell, the more mitochondria it has, said Alan Hodgkinson from the University of Montreal, Canada.The many mitochondria in the same cell can have different genetic mutations. Our research helps us to understand how variable mitochondrial RNA processing can be and what the possible consequences of that might be on health, Hodgkinson said.The findings add extra layers of complexity to our understanding of how genetics influence our health.The study appeared in the journal, Science."

Hundreds of farmers, who cultivated potato last year, have already opted for ginger this year.Last year, potato was cultivated in 21.5 ha in the district. This year, 27,000 tonnes of seed potatoes have already reached cold storage centres in Hassan.The seed potatoes available in go-downs are enough for cultivation in 20,000 ha. According to Horticulture Department officials, last year, ginger was cultivated in about 8,000 ha. This year, it might go up to 12,000 ha. The major factor attracting farmers towards ginger is the price. Ginger growers have got, by and large, a good price throughout the year. In the case of potato, however, they are not sure of good yield, given the monsoon forecast, Shakeel Ahmed, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, said on Wednesday. The Horticulture Department, based on suggestions from scientists, has resolved that the best time for sowing potato seeds is between May 15 and June 15. Potato growers are worried over the yield, in the view of the poor monsoon forecast.Those without irrigation facilities are more anxious, the official said.Many borewells have gone dry due to drought in the last two years.Besides these factors, farmers are worried about blight that could attack their crop.The district administration will make arrangements to sell seed potatoes to farmers in the first week of May.However, it has not taken a decision on fixing price for seed potatoes.The election code of conduct has come in the way of holding meetings with elected representatives, as both Deputy Commissioner V. Anbukkumar, who is the Returning Officer, and Shakeel Ahmed, who is an Assistant Returning Officer, cannot attend such meetings.Dr. Ahmed said that seed potatoes transported from Punjab were not certified. However, this time, about 5,000 quintals of certified seeds are available. Certified seeds are available in Hubli. If any farmer is interested in purchasing certified seeds, the department will help him procure them, he said."

Anbukkumar on Monday held two meetings with the merchants for fixing the price of seed potatoes, but the meetings remained inconclusive. The merchants stuck to their demand of Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,100 a quintal price, which the district administration refused to accept.The district is a major producer of potato. This year, farmers are expected to cultivate potato in about 20,000 hectares in the district.In the meeting held in the morning, the merchants said they had procured seed potatoes from Punjab by investing over Rs. 1,600 to Rs. 1,800 a quintal and they could not sell it for less than Rs. 2,000 a quintal.However, Mr. Anbukkumar said that the officers of the Horticulture Department had collected data about the price of seed potatoes in Punjab. He informed the merchants that the price was Rs. 900 a quintal in February and Rs. 1,020 a quintal of seed potatoes in March.As the district administration and merchants failed to arrive at a consensus, the meeting was adjourned to 4 p.m. At the subsequent meeting, however, the merchants refused to budge from their demand, despite Mr. Anbukkumar requesting them to reconsider their decision for the benefit of farmers.Seed potatoes were priced at Rs. 1,600 a quintal in Hassan, last year."

49,"Hot potato, wait for Lima lessons",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140510/jsp/odisha/story_18324934.jsp,2014-05-10,Telegraph,"A vendor sells potato at a market in Bhubaneswar. Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, May 9: Potato crisis looms large in the state this year, but without setting the basics right at home two bureaucrats (none of them scientists) are set to embark on a tuber trip to the Latin American nation of Peru tomorrow. Director (horticulture) and secretary (agriculture) will be making the costly trip to Peru to get hands-on experience on how various types of potato seeds are produced and examine whether some of those can be grown in Odisha. Director (horticulture) Sanjeev Chadha said: We will go and see how they produce various types of potato seeds and whether these seeds are suitable for cultivation here. The first-hand learning will be of great help to our state. On being asked why scientists were not there in the team, Chadha said: That would have been a costly affair. We will talk to the scientists who are working at the International Potato Centre there. By the time the officials return from Lima, the capital of Peru and home to the International Potato Centre, the price of the tuber would have played havoc with the homemakers monthly budget as traders here see the cost of a kilo of the produce crossing the Rs 20 mark. For the state to benefit from the learnings of the Lima trip it will take a while, but what traders need here is basic infrastructure such as more cold chains. The crisis that looms large in the state this year is because the government has failed to learn from its past experience and initiate steps to increase potato production. The shortage of cold storages has only aggravated the crisis. Initial signs of the crisis are already there to be read if the steady rise of potato price is any pointer. The produce that was being sold for Rs 12 a kilo barely two weeks ago is hovering around Rs 17 to 20 per kg in the local market. Today I bought it for Rs 18 for a kg, but traders said that the price would shoot up in the coming days, said Mitanjanli Pradhan, a teacher. Food supplies and consumer welfare secretary Madhu Sundan Padhi said: Because of the ongoing election process in Bengal, there is a drop in supply of potato to the state. The situation will improve shortly. We are monitoring movement of the potatoes-laden trucks. While states requirement is nearly 9 lakh tonnes per annum, the state is only producing 1.98 lakh metric tonnes of potatoes. Keeping in mind the huge need, we are procuring potatoes from different places, said Padhi. He added that he was not in a position to say why the state failed to produce the required amount of potatoes in the state. While Padhi is unaware for the reason for poor production of potatoes, the state governments mission to Lima is also about finding out ways to have greater produce. The team will also study how sweet potatoes can be produced in a more organised way. Scientists of the International Potato Centre are working here in Dhenkanal, Koraput, Ganjam and Kandhamal districts. We are taking along with us their feedback for submission at the international centre, Chadha said. In the state, cultivation of the high-yielding varieties of potato is done at Lamtaput in Koraput and in other districts such as Boudh, Balangir and Angul. While the state failed to increase its production level, Bengal is producing 107 lakh tonnes, Bihar 61.04 lakh tonnes, Assam 7.83 lakh tonnes and Jharkhand 6.52 lakh tonnes of potatoes. If the production level is taken to a level of 6-7 lakh tonnes a year then there would be no scarcity situation of potato in the state, said an official. A few officials also pointed out that the situation could be improved if enough cold chains were built to store potatoes in advance. The state has only 15 government-run cold storages. While six cold storages are being operated under cooperation department, the horticulture directorate runs five such units. Four others are operational under the state-run Agriculture Promotion and Investment Corporation Limited. An official in the agriculture department said the provision of capital investment subsidy of 60 per cent for upto 5,000-tonne capacity cold storages would be made in general area and 75 per cent subsidy for scheduled areas While a cold storage is under construction with the assistance from the horticulture directorate, there is a proposal to build three more units through State Agro Industries Corporation, the official added. To create more space, low-cost cold storages would be constructed at 183 places across the state."
50,Obesity: Don't blame it all on calories,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/406069/obesity-dont-blame-all-calories.html,2014-05-11,Deccan Herald,"Obesity: Don't blame it all on caloriesNot all calories are created equal as far as weight gain and obesityPeople have long been told that the cure for obesity is simple: Eat fewer calories and exercise more.But a new documentary challenges that notion, making the case that American people have been misled by the idea that we get fat simply because we consume more calories than we expend. The film explores what it sees as some of the more insidious corporate and political forces behind the rise of childhood obesity, and it examines whether increasing levels of sugar consumption have played an outsized role in the epidemic.The film, called Fed Up, has as executive producers Katie Couric, the former anchor of The CBS Evening News, and Laurie David, who was also a producer of the global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth.Ms Couric, who narrates the film, said she came up with the idea after years of covering the obesity epidemic left her with more questions than answers.What struck me was that the more I reported on childhood obesity and the longer I was in this business, the worse the problem seemed to be getting, Ms Couric said in an interview. I felt like we were never reallygiving people a handle on what was causing this and why the rates were skyrocketing the way they were.The film draws on commentary from obesity experts and nutrition scientists, and it tells the stories of several obese children around the country who struggle to lose weight despite strict dieting and in some cases hours of daily exercise. But at the heart of the film is a question that is widely debated among scientists: Are all calories equal?Dr David Ludwig, the director of the obesity programme at Boston Childrens Hospital,argues in the film that they are not. In recent studies, Ludwig has shown that high-carbohydrate diets appear to slow metabolic rates compared to diets higher in fat and protein, so that people expend less energy even when consuming the same number of calories. Ludwig has found that unlike calories from so-called low glycemic foods (like beans, nuts and non-starchy vegetables), those from high glycemic foods (such as sugar, bread and potatoes) spike blood sugar and stimulate hunger and cravings, which can drive people to overeat.While people can certainly lose weight in the short term by focusing on calories,Ludwig said, studies show that the majority of people on calorie-restricted diets eventually fail. The common explanation is that people have difficulty resisting temptation, he said. But another possibility is that highly processed foods undermine our metabolism and overwhelm our behaviour.At Harvard Medical School, Dr Dariush Mozaffarian, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology whose research was cited by experts in the film, said that the long-held idea that we get fat solely because we consume more calories than we expend is based on outdated science.He has studied the effects that different foods have on weight gain and said that it is true that 100 calories of fat, protein and carbohydrates are the same in a thermodynamic sense, in that they release the same amount of energy when exposed to a Bunsen burner in a lab. But in a complex organism like ahuman being, he said, these foods influencesatiety, metabolic rate, brain activity, blood sugar and the hormones that store fat in very different ways.Difference in absorptionStudies also show that calories from different foods are not absorbed the same way. When people eat high-fibre foods like nuts and some vegetables, for example, only about three-quarters of the calories they contain are absorbed. The rest are excreted from the body unused. So the calories listed on their labels are not what the body is actually getting.The implicit suggestion is that there are no bad calories, just bad people eating too much, Mozaffarian said. But the evidence is very clear that not all calories are created equal as far as weight gain and obesity. If youre focusing on calories, you can easily be misguided.Some of the harshest criticism in the film is aimed at a recent food industry initiative  led by companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo  to remove calories from their products in an effort to address obesity.If somebody is drowning in a swimming pool, you could remove a few gallons of water from the pool, and that person will still likely drown, Ludwig said. Whether there is on average 1,000 calories in the food supply too many per person or 800 is really unlikely to make a meaningful difference. What would make a difference is improvement in the quality of the foods available.But Marianne Smith Edge of the International Food Information Council, an industry-financed group that published a review of Fed Up, said the film overstates data on how much sugar Americans are consuming and wrongly portrays sugar as a lone dietary villain, much as dietary fat was vilified in decades past. Just as research in the last few years has vindicated some fats and shown them to be beneficial, she said, the science on sugar is evolving as well.I think the focus on particular nutrients doesnt tell you the true story, she said. It really is about overall calorie consumption and reduced physical activity.Ms Smith Edge, who is a registered dietitian, cited a 2012 study by Y Claire Wang of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, which showed that the average child must eliminate 64 calories a day in order for the childhood obesity rate to fall to 14.6 percent by 2020, a goal set by the federal government.In an interview, Dr Wang said that for the most part, if were just talking about body weight and obesity, the evidence seems to point in the direction that calories are calories. Wang said that studies consistently show that sugary beverages, potato chips and other high-glycemic foods are indeed associated with weight gain. But this is because they are rapidly digested and easy to consume in large amounts, not because they bypass our energy balance.Wang said, however, that reducing calories should not be the sole focus of obesity prevention programmes. Studies show, for example, that sugary beverages are linked to an increased risk of diabetes and other chronic diseases, but their impact on body weight explains only half of the increased risk, Wang said.These foods mess up our insulin regulation system and affect other inflammatory pathways, she said. And that has nothing to do with how they affect body weight. Ms Couric, who has two children, said that she became involved in making the film as a mom and a concerned citizen, and that her goal was to start a national dialogue about the quality of our food supply.This film doesnt purport to have all the answers, Ms Couric said. But this is a wake-up call that I hope will spur some solutions. This is not just about carrying a few extra pounds or looking better in your bathing suit. This is a national epidemic with huge societal ramifications."

But on drying and cutting them open he found that they were of bad quality.As a farmer, I am well aware of the quality of the seeds. The potatoes shrunk in size and developed a bad odour. The product I purchased for Rs, 24,000 was not good for sowing, Mr. Shivaiah told reporters.He complained to the Deputy Commissioner that the traders had not allowed him to check the quality of the potatoes before purchasing it.

The good news is that taxis and commercial vehicles used for transporting vegetables and fruits have called off the stir.Talks broke down as the government and the Karnataka State Lorry Owners' and Agents Association differed on key issues like withdrawal of penal clause of Section 379 which imposes a two-year jail term for illegal sand mining and transportation.The association hasn't transported sand for the past 23 days to push for its demand that the government relax certain provisions in the new rules. This has resulted in prices shooting up to Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh per truck load.While association president GR Shanmugappa said they're ready to transport sand provided the government gives permits, ministers HC Mahadevappa and TB Jayachandra said the government needs a week to identify new sand deposits.The association insists that Section 379 shouldn't be made applicable to sand transporters and cases booked against them should be withdrawn. Jayachandra said the government was looking at the legal implication of withdrawing cases and also releasing over 400 trucks seized for transporting sand illegally.The new Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession (Amendment) Rules 2013 is aimed at not only curbing illegal sand mining but also increasing revenue to the exchequer. Only the public works department has been authorized to mine and sell sand at rates set by the government. Extracted sand from designated blocks would be dumped at spots fixed by the PWD where it'll be auctioned.The rules stipulate constitution of taluk and district sand-monitoring committees with environment officers to oversee the activity. Earth-movers won't be allowed to extract sand. Sand mining is allowed between 10am and 6pm and it can be transported between 6am and 6pm. Police have the power to seize illegally mined or transported sand.PWD minister Mahadevappa said M-sand (manufacturing sand) is the future for construction. ""M-sand is cost effective and as durable as regular sand. The department plans to promote M-sand in its constructions,"" he said. A delegation comprising Mahadevappa, Jayachandra, technical experts and officials visited the JSW plant in Toranagal, Bellary district on Monday to study M-sand's potential.Veggies were brought to the city despite transporters protesting at the APMC yard in Yeswanthpur. This is the biggest yard where food for Bangalore is off-loaded. Truckers joined the three-week agitation of sand transporters on Sunday. However, they allowed smaller vehicles to take perishable food items like potatoes and onions to markets in the city.There was no impact on over 400 fuel stations across the city. Tankers owned by petroleum companies remained on normal schedules. ""Even if the strike continues for two more days, there won't be a shortage of fuel. We've deployed tankers to transport fuel from the Devenagundi depot on the outskirts of Bangalore,"" said Bhushan Narang, chairman, Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders. He said the city gets about 1000 tankers (about 200 lakh litres) of petrol and diesel every day.V Harikrishnan, president, Bangalore District Chemists and Druggist Association, said stocks would last for a week. ""We're hiring other carriers who are not participating in the strike,"" he said. There are 4,000 pharmacy shops in Bangalore.The airport cabs got more calls from Sunday as private cabs ferrying passengers to and fro the airport remained off the roads on Sunday and Monday. The corporate taxi companies - Meru, Mega and KSTDC --- stayed out of the strike."

But, the government revised upwards the data for October to 7.2% from the previously reported 7%, highlighting the extent of price pressures present in the economy. As expected, food prices moderated due to easing vegetable prices but potato prices continued to be firm. Potato prices shot up 55% in December (year-on-year), up from the previous month's 26.7% and likely to remain as a pressure point. Food inflation still hovered in double digits but the pace of increase was slower than the previous month. Vegetable prices rose 57% in December, slower than 95% in November.The moderation in wholesale price inflation comes close on the heels of the easing of retail inflation and provides relief to policymakers and the government, battling criticism over stubborn prices.Economists said the moderation in inflation provides headroom to RBI to act on interest rates. A majority of economists expect the central bank to hold rates when it reviews monetary policy next week. The central bank has consistently cautioned about inflationary risks and has raised rates to calm price pressures.""The easing of inflation for the month of December provides some relief to the RBI. With the CPI and WPI inflation coming in at a lower level in December 2013, RBI may contemplate a rate cut if the WPI and CPI figures continue to move downwards in the next two months,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.""The expectation is that WPI and CPI inflation should remain in the range of 6.5-7% and 9-10% respectively in the next two months in the absence of any external shock,"" Sabnavis said, adding that he does not expect any change in the central bank's stance in the January policy review."

Consumers are unlikely to be able to notice the price changes as the latest available official figures on retail inflation show the rate of price rise was at a three-month high of nearly 8.6 per cent in April against 8.3 per cent in March.Onion prices fell nearly 18 per cent since March. Inflation in potato prices, however, rose from 27.8 per cent in March to 31.6 per cent in April. Inflation in milk and eggs and meat remained elevated at close to 10 per cent against 11.2 per cent in the previous month.Overall food inflation slowed to 8.64 per cent in April from 9.9 per cent in March.The headline inflation has shown a dip on the back of moderation in prices of food articles, fuel and power. However, given the recent increase in the diesel prices and uncertain outlook for monsoon, price movements will have to be critically watched going ahead. For the new government, this would be the single biggest challenge, said FICCI President Sidharth Birla in a statement. He also expressed hope that the new government would roll out a comprehensive action plan to tackle inflation.With the price hikes for diesel having been put on hold during elections and the rupee appreciating inflation in fuel products too eased somewhat from 11.2 per cent in March to just under 9 per cent."

Picture by B. Halder Kunming in the first week of May, Cuxhaven in the second, Aalen in June and Herefordshire in October. Students from city schools are going places, literally. A bunch of students from St. James School and Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan (BSS) are just back after a nine-day exchange programme with Qinglai School in Kunming while 20 students from Sushila Birla Girls School and Birla High School for Boys are spending a fortnight at Amandus-Abendroth-Gymnasium in Cuxhaven, Germany. From attending classes and laboratories to making presentations and putting up performances to showcase Indian culture as well as learning about the host nation and its people, exchange tours are a busy time for students. Sunirmal Chakravarthi, the principal of La Martiniere for Boys, calls it a win-win situation. Travel is the best form of education that goes way beyond classrooms and textbooks, he said. Get set, go When Raghav Daryanani, a Class XII student of St. James, was packing his bags, he took with him flour and potatoes to make alu parathas for his Chinese friends. He came back with recipes for dumplings. Each province has its own variety of dumplings and in different shapes. I could just make the flower-shaped ones but I tasted them all, said the son of a restaurateur, who spent hours watching Chinese videos on YouTube and even managed to pick up a few greetings before boarding the flight. The preparations dont end there. The BSS girls rehearsed for weeks before performing at the Kunming school. I danced to the tune of Ami chini go chini tomare and Sohag chand bodoni. Some of my friends put up a Chinese play based on Hiuen Tsangs travels in India, said Samprikta Das of Class VI, the youngest member of her team. All in a days work For Koshi Cherian and Angus Alphonso, both Class IX students of St. James, the day began early as they had to be in school along with their buddy Wang Ching Yi, 9, at 8 sharp. The boys attended culture classes, were shown a live demonstration of a tea ceremony, picked up a few kung fu kicks and also attended lectures on ancient Chinese dynasties. After school, we would have dinner. Most Chinese people go dancing after dinner. They believe it helps them digest food better. So we too went dancing. We also played badminton and table tennis there, Koshi said. Naman Madhogaria of Birla High has been attending school in the morning and discovering the city with his German partner and his parents by the evening. The air is very fresh here, the traffic is thin and most people ride bicycles unlike in Calcutta, said the boy, whos been bonding over football with his German buddies. Early starters British Council has been one of the pioneers of the concept, reaching out to city schools and facilitating exchange since 2004. The Heritage School has been partnering with a college in Herefordshire, the UK, since 2007. Every year, students from the college come to Calcutta in January and students from The Heritage visit them in October. There had been teething problems because our students are more academically oriented and theirs is a sports college but we worked on it, said Seema Sapru, the principal of The Heritage School, which has been involved in exchange with other countries too. The association often goes beyond the exchange programmes, as the school found out when a student from Germany came to spend six months here. He wanted to attend classes here and stayed with three-four families by turns, Sapru said. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy has been hosting visitors from Carlo-Schmid-Gymnasium, a secondary school in Tubingen, and sending students to the German university town for six years. For the past three years, St. Xaviers Collegiate School boys have been engaged in an exchange of culture, knowledge and bonding with students of a Kunming school. Students taking part in exchange programmes usually have to bear the travel expenses but some schools share the cost. Students are selected on the basis of academic performance and project work and those with knowledge of the language of the host country are given preference. I would much rather prefer trips where costs are covered because then I can select kids on merit and not their ability to pay, said Anjana Saha, the principal of Mahadevi Birla World Academy, which represented India at the Shakespeare in Asia Festival presented by Shakespeare4All in Hong Kong last year. Kaveri Dutt, the principal of Modern High School for Girls, admitted that it can leave some disappointed but added dissemination takes place and it is not exclusive. Books and beyond The merits, however, far outweigh the demerits. Young people today need to be able to understand the world they live in beyond their own countries and communities. An international dimension in the classroom will help them access more opportunities and be better informed about the world. Whether they are visiting the UK or collaborating on a project online, the benefits are for students and teachers in both countries, said Sujata Sen, the director of British Council, eastern India. Class I kids of Sri Sri Academy put together four storybooks with the Level I children of Windmill Primary School in Headington, the UK, as part of the British Councils Global School Partnership.The UK children conceived the stories and some of our students drew the illustrations. It was an enriching experience for both schools, said Suvina Shunglu, the principal of Sri Sri Academy. Sushila Birla girls are working on a project funded by the Bosch Foundation to make an animated movie on tigers and mussels. They are among the most endangered species in India and Germany respectively. We started the project in June last year and in November students and teachers from Cuxhaven came to Calcutta to work on the project, said Purnima Ravindran, the coordinator for outreach programmes at Sushila Birla. Puravi Nath, Class X, The Heritage School, was happy to get an introduction to life in the UK while classmate Bratin Ghosh feels the culture education classes he attended will help him mingle if he goes there to study. The Heritage School has worked with its partner institution in the UK on several projects on conservation of resources, women empowerment and Thames vs Hooghly. While collaborating with a German school, the Heritage students learnt how to calculate energy by burning beer. The German students, in turn, were taken to the Sunderbans to study solar energy. The takeaways arent restricted to academics and cultural exchange. Initially, the children would refuse to carry their bags but they learnt to adjust, said principal Sapru. On one of the early trips, we had told the UK school that some of our children were vegetarian. Once the kids reached, we realised they were vegetarian but didnt eat vegetables! New bonds Home stay with a German, Chinese, British or Irish family leads to a deeper understanding and appreciation of culture. Samprikta of BSS learnt about discipline on her China trip. They are all early risers and finish breakfast at 7.30am. Dinner is served at 6.30pm, said the Class VI student, whos already missing her Chinese friend Isabella. Beate Mrasek, Sushila Birla student Vanshika Bagrodias German host, was more than happy to host her. Its a good way to learnt about the culture of India and to have another child in the house, said the mother. Communication can be a problem at times as most Chinese students have poor English skills but the children overcame the language barrier with the help of technology. We would write in English and run it through Google Translate. Our Chinese friends would read it and they pass their phone to us for us to read the English translation, smiled Raghav of St. James. Give some, take some If city students come back richer from the exchange trips, students from other countries too take back with them lessons and moments to cherish. The principal and vice-director of Qinglai School were impressed by the maths and English language laboratories at BSS. The maths laboratory has software like the Geometers Sketchpad that makes learning interactive. In the language lab, children do phonetics and learn the differences between the American and British accent, said Sunita Sen, the principal of BSS. Six Chinese students who attended classes at Ashok Hall Girls Higher Secondary School last month were treated to traditional Bengali fare of shukto, mug daal, chingri malai curry. The home science students made tossed vegetables, spaghetti and pudding for them, said Manjir Ghosh, the principal of the school. The visitors learnt a few throwball moves and on Rabindra Jayanti, they sang Momo chitte niti nritye. German students hosted by Lakshmipat Singhania Academy last year had soaked in the culture and flavours of the city, even catching an India-Pakistan cricket match at the Eden Gardens. Lesson for everyone Teachers too benefit from the exchange of ideas. Several teachers from the US spent nine months in city schools as part of a USIS programme this year. Rachel Marie Glogowski organised a Halloween party for children at Dolna Day School while Christine Zographia Purdy encouraged her students at St. Johns Diocesan Girls Higher Secondary School to read. Exchange of culture and ideas... helps strengthen English language instruction, while providing cultural insights, said Joanne Joria, the director of the American Center. Sometimes, partner schools borrow ideas. Rachel Folkard and Susie Hillard, teachers at Sir John Lillie Primary School in London, loved the concept of nature clubs during their visit to South City International School in April. Its a great way to promote wildlife and nature conservation. I will start a nature club when I go back, Rachel said.

59,A revolution of rising expectations,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140520/jsp/opinion/story_18352849.jsp,2014-05-20,Telegraph,"Never has a prime minister of India come to the job with so much baggage and home furnishing. Great expectations have been simmering in the pot of hard times for a while now. Or, at least, of the perceived hard times that the Congress, not so paradoxically, has helped to display as five years of Dickensian decay and dunderheadedness under the Manmohan-Singh-headed United Progressive Alliance. A different kind of enthusiasm was evident when Jawaharlal Nehru took over the reins of the first Lok Sabha from a crumbling, bankrupt, London-headquartered multi-national corporation. Expectations, as we understand them now, were of a different order. Nehru presented a Great Indian Rope Bridge for passengers to cross over from a rickety steamer to a new bobbing boat. This was feted, at least by those who did notice that a transfer of power from foreign sahebs to Indian sahebs had taken place under their collective nose. The term, revolution of rising expectations, was invented in the early 1950s by Harlan Cleveland, an American aid official who used it in the context of a significant change that he noted in the attitudes of the local population in Taiwan. This marked a stage in a countrys social and economic development in which aspirations became convictions that people would achieve, possess and enjoy more than their parents or they themselves have in the past. By the early 1970s, as observed by the Pondicherry-based social science research institute, Mothers Service Society, the phenomenon of rising aspirations was evident in the first generation of Indians born after Independence. This, in turn, had an impact on how they saw their and the governments roles in nation-building  that rather twee term happily claimed by the Left, Right and Centre. Almost 70 years after Nehru swiftly morphed from nationalist leader to leader of the nation, Narendra Modi comes to the prime ministerial chair after successfully driving home the glaring mismatch between What was to be and What is in 2014 India. If Nehru had the advantage of the nations freedom from external powers being the most precious and immediately operational feature of his first term, Modi still has to deliver any of his goodies. How the Gujarat Model will be retro-fitted across India to bring about the radical changes that his followers crave is yet to be ascertained. If this best-selling model has any hidden features or costs lurking in them, no one knows. But such is the business of selling radical change  its seductive charms as well as its perceived fears. The promise of change, of course, comes with a busload of exaggerations. The same holds true for the fear of change. Hope for Paradise and you get Purgatory. Hope to avoid Apocalypse and you survive it. God chooses certain people to do the difficult work. I believe god has chosen me for this work. Now I only need your blessings, Modi had said with the standard operational humility of all messiahs last month in a holographic address beamed across the country Obi-Wan Kenobi-meets-Burning-Bush style. Bringing in divine sanction into the sales pitch can only mean one thing: you want expectations to be heaven high. But what was valid endorsement-seeking rhetoric while making a bid to become prime minister may not hold true once a prime minister. With the hurlyburly done, and the battle won, will the game-changer still be gung-ho about changing the game? And while everyone looks forward to (or recoils from) Modi changing the role of the prime minister, very few people seem to risk wanting to know whether the prime ministership will also change Modi. For those who have put their faith in Narendra Modis prime ministership  and I use faith here in the sense of complete trust or confidence in someone as well as in the sense of fidelity  there will be unforeseen disappointments down the line. And one is not referring to the colourful Hindi acronym of KLPD that most aptly describes the disappointment that comes when great expectations are dashed  something that many Modi lovers are likely to experience when their prime minister forgoes any Hindutva adventure. If Modi, as the totem pole of the BJP victory has been adept in anything in particular, it is to recognize sell-by-date products and junk them after they have expired, even if it comes to Dronacharyas who still believe themselves to be Lal Krishnas. Its just that overseeing mutatis mutandis  changing only those things which require to be changed  is surprisingly difficult when a jump is required to be made from the moving train of rhetoric to the galloping horse of practice. For the 814 million Indians who voted or watched from the sidelines, all this business of corruption and economic grind-down, vitally important and daisy-chained to their lives as they are, matters as much as global warming does to those pining for rain in May. What matters is something far more metaphysical as well as banal: Where will the piper take us with his tune? Will he bring down the price of potatoes and real estate? For the Modi-believer, disgusted by the shoddy shamanism of the UPA (and the BJP before the advent of its alpha leader), the journey with this prime minister is truly billed as the destination. But unlike a holiday to Disneyland, the excitement of a lunar trip is accompanied by the depressing prospect of a fake moon landing. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee in her pre-chief-minister avatar, had turbo-charged the word, paribartan, with the very warp and woof of change. Three years down the line, it is easier to see that the real paribartan may have happened temporarily (and with disastrous consequences) when the baton was switched while being passed from the hand of Jyoti Basu to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in 2000. As was the case with the Left Front government in Calcutta, it was the UPAs inability to match, let alone surpass, the promise of change that made it look like a bureaucracy pretending to be a government. Despite being a nation clamouring for change, India is remarkably conservative. This is the same country that rejected the proclamation of India Shining in 2004 simply because the phrase was constructed in the present continuous even as it has had no qualms for decades on end to watch a trickle-down economy trickle down to a vast majority of its people by the twin forces of gravity and good intention. In The Prince, Niccol Machiavelli notes how there is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things. For the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit from the new order. Modi will know, if he doesnt already, that even with patriots among his powerful backers, there is nothing called a free stay in 7 Race Course Road. In Bankimchandra Chattopadhyays Anandamath, the rich and young Mahendra Singha negotiates the horrors and turmoil of the great Bengal famine of 1770. At Anandamath, the forest refuge for warrior-monks waging a guerrilla war against the cruel tax- extracting forces of the Nawab, he is shown three idols of the mother goddess personifying the nation. The first is of the resplendent figure of Jagatdhatri to signify What Mother was; the second is the fierce, naked figure of Kali signifying What Mother has become, and finally, a radiant Durga idol. This is what Mother will be, the brahmachari accompanying Mahendra explains. We have already seen all three India idols in the BJPs election campaigns. With expectations raised like never before, a traditionally patient nation now waits impatiently to see what Mother will end up becoming  even as the prime-minister-designate rolls up his kurta sleeves and cracks his knuckles before taking a shot at changing, well, everything."

Beans come from Uttar Pradesh and the supply is really less,"" said G R Pillai, assistant secretary, Chandigarh Marketing Committee.Onion prices were constant, but fluctuating. Pillai said,"" The supply of onion from Nasik is coming at a good pace but there are different varieties. So, the price depends upon the quality. Onions are ranging between Rs 15 per kg to Rs 20 per kg and the supply from Madhya Pradesh and Haryana is also good.""The prices of tomatoes were same as that of onion.

At a meeting chaired by the cabinet secretary last week before Modi took charge as Prime Minister, consumer affairs ministry was asked to keep track of prices of pulses and take necessary steps, including coordinating with state government to use storage facilities for onion, sources said.Government officials said while the food inflation was moderate at 5.2% in April in comparison to 5.7% in March, the inflation in April last year was much less at 5.77%. They added that the food ministry had submitted the details of food grain stock till May 12. The wheat stock stood at 245.6 lakh tonnes in comparison to 237.5 lakh tonnes in May 2013.But there are concerns of potato prices going up as the supply is set to fall in the next few months. Potato prices increased by Rs 4 and Rs 5 per kg in Delhi and Mumbai respectively in the last two months. The price rise was the steepest in Thiruvanthapuram (Rs 11 kg).Even onion prices have increased across most of the cities in the last two months. The increase ranged between Rs 2 and Rs 7 per kg, according to the data available from price monitoring cell (PMC).The data also show prices of some of the pulses going up between March 26 and May 26. Moongdal prices in Delhi recorded an increase by Rs 14 per kg while in Nagpur and Ahmedabad it increased by Rs 20.Sources said at cabinet secretary's meeting, the consumer affairs secretary mentioned the rising prices of milk. PMC data show the maximum increase in milk price was Rs 6 per litre in Jaipur and Patna while it increased by Rs 4 per litre in Delhi.On Tuesday, new food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said checking food inflation will be the main focus for the new government."

He had been a grape farmer for many years but had decided to refrain from it last year as the crashing grape prices did not bring good returns. Also, there was no proper cold storage facility for the fruits, according to him.Deciding to do some experimental farming, he had gone to the market in Batlagundu in Dindigul district and purchased carrot seeds. Many of his counterparts had tried to discourage him as carrots had not been cultivated in the valley so far. Undeterred, he had sown the 1.200 kg of seeds on one acre of land in October last year and irrigated the crop with a sprinkler system as he knew carrots needed a cool environment.He is elated now as he has reaped four tonnes of good carrots from his acre in the first harvest last week. ""I used only organic manure and cow dung to fertilise the crop and the results are very good,"" he said. Sannasi said that he had believed that carrots, potatoes and butterbeans grew only in the cold climates of the upper hilly regions. Five tonnes is what he would get this time but he says that as he had been apprehensive of the results he had not done it in a full-fledged manner. In places like Kodaikanal and Ooty they get about 10 tonnes per acre and ""maybe I will go for a larger scale next time,"" he added.According to S Murugan, deputy director of horticulture, Theni this has been a very good effort. ""The colour of the carrot is good and the size too, but I feel that the taste has to be slightly better and maybe that could be achieved if the carrots are harvested after 10 more days giving them the benefit of remaining in the cold season,"" he said."

A special meeting called by chief minister Parkash Singh Badal sent the state departments concerned into an overdrive, reviewing the status of their projects and ways to get adequate funds from the Centre.According to sources, apart from seeking financial aid to incentivize food processing industry, the Punjab government is keen on getting another food park sanctioned in the state. In fact, Badal had recently written to the outgoing Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar to sanction more mega food parks in the state as it is the granary of India.In his letter to Pawar, Badal had pointed out that despite being an agrarian state, Punajb has so far been allotted only one food park, being set up by International Mega Food Park Ltd at Dabwala Kalan village in Ferozepur district. The message was circulated on Monday after Harsimrat was tipped to get the portfolio. The food processing department reportedly had its own meetings during the day so as to get a rough plan ready at the earliest.Amit Talwar, director, food processing, said, ""The focus on supplying processed food instead of raw produce out of Punjab had started last year with the finalization of a policy on how to incentivize the industry.""The state government had been looking at adoption of state-of-the-art food processing and a residue utilization policy, but things are yet to translate on the ground, sources said.There are plans to set up a ""centre of potato expertise in Punjab"" for which, an agreement has been signed with the Dutch government by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana and the Potato Seed Growers Confederation (POSCON).Similarly, Sampuran Agri Ventures Pvt Ltd has been roped in by Punjab government to set up 30 MW rice straw-based bio-methanation power projects at a cost of Rs 400 crore.Last year, the state government had given major concessions to food processing projects. These include exemption from basic stamp duty and registration fee on first sale/transfer of built up space of units or land in the project area, exemption from electricity duty up to 5% for five years, permission for direct purchase of food grains/maize/fruits and vegetables required for primary processing by units in the mega food park project.BOX:Proposed projects to get startedEven though the government claimed that out of the 128 MoUs signed at the Progressive Punjab Investor's Summit held in December last year, 62 agreements worth Rs 12,000 crore were for agro and food processing sector, the projects continued to remain on paper. ""There was a lean phase due to elections and things are likely to gain momentum in the coming months,"" said an official.On the wish list-- Another food park for Punjab-- Financial package to incentivize food processing sector-- Centre for potato expertise in Punjab-- Nine projects for making bio-ethanol from rice strawThe Union minister for food processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal offers hope of finally bringing crop diversification to Punjab and preserving precious natural resources like water and soil. A vibrant food processing industry will also augment the dwindling incomes of farmers who are wary of adopting new crops due to lack of buyers and are following the wheat-paddy and wheat-cotton cycle for the past three decades. Despite being the food bowl of the country, Punjab's potential in this sector has remained untapped. The new Cabinet minister should not lose this opportunity to help the farmers of the state."
66,Campaign against junk food,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/410671/campaign-against-junk-food.html,2014-05-30,Deccan Herald,"Campaign against junk foodMichelle Obama, May 30, 2014 INYT: 0:17 ISTWhen we began our Lets Move! initiative four years ago, we set one simple but ambitious goal: to end the epidemic of childhood obesity in a generation so that kids born today will grow up healthy.To achieve this goal, we have adhered to one clear standard: what works(Italics).The initiatives we undertake are evidence-based, and we rely on the most current science.Research indicated that kids needed less sugar, salt and fat in their diets, so we revamped school lunch menus accordingly. When data showed that the lack of nearby grocery stores negatively affected peoples eating habits, we worked to get more fresh-food retailers into underserved areas.Studies on habit formation in young children drove our efforts to get healthier food and more physical activity into child care centres.Today, we are seeing glimmers of progress. Tens of millions of kids are getting better nutrition in school; families are thinking more carefully about food they eat, cook and buy; companies are rushing to create healthier products to meet the growing demand; and the obesity rate is finally beginning to fall from its peak among our youngest children.But unfortunately, were now seeing attempts in Congress to undo so much of what weve accomplished on behalf of our children. Take, for example, whats going on now with the Women, Infants and Children programme, known as WIC. This US federal programme is designed to provide supplemental nutrition to low-income women and their babies and toddlers.Right now, the House of Representatives is considering a bill to override science by mandating that white potatoes be included on the list of foods that women can purchase using WIC dollars. Now, there is nothing wrong with potatoes.The problem is that many women and children already consume enough potatoes and not enough of the nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables they need. Thats why the Institute of Medicine - the non-partisan, scientific body that advises on the standards for WIC - has said that potatoes should not be part of the WIC programme.Unfortunately, this isnt an isolated occurrence. Were seeing the same kind of scenario unfold with our school lunch programme. Back in 2010, Congress passed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which set higher nutritional standards for school lunches, also based on recommendations from the Institute of Medicine.Today, 90 per cent of schools report that they are meeting these new standards. As a result, kids are now getting more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and other foods they need to be healthy.Quality of foodThis a big win for all of us since we spend more than $10 billion a year on school lunches and should not be spending those hard-earned taxpayer dollars on junk food for our children.Yet some members of the House of Representatives are now threatening to roll back these new standards and lower the quality of food our kids get in school. They want to make it optional, not mandatory, for schools to serve fruits and vegetables to our kids.They also want to allow more sodium and fewer whole grains than recommended into school lunches.Remember a few years ago when Congress declared that the sauce on a slice of pizza should count as a vegetable in school lunches? You dont have to be a nutritionist to know that this doesnt make much sense.Yet were seeing the same thing happening again with these new efforts to lower nutrition standards in our schools. Our children deserve so much better than this. Even with the progress we have made, one in three children in this country is still overweight or obese.One in three is expected to develop diabetes in his or her lifetime. And this isnt just about our childrens health; its about the health of our economy as well. We already spend an estimated $190 billion a year treating obesity-related conditions.The bottom line is very simple: As parents, we always put our childrens interests first. We wake up every morning and go to bed every night worrying about their well-being and their futures.And when we make decisions about our kids health, we rely on doctors and experts who can give us accurate information based on sound science. Our leaders in Washington should do the same."

68,Wholesale vegetable prices fall steeply,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/wholesale-vegetable-prices-fall-steeply/article6073491.ece,2014-06-02,The Hindu,"The Azadpur market has witnessed a sharp decline in the wholesale prices of vegetables this summer, when the rates are usually at their highest this time of the year.This has been good news for the citizens who had been reeling under a spell of high commodity prices over the past few months.Incidentally, while many have been attributing the fall in prices  which has been to the tune of 50 to 80 per cent in case of vegetables like gourd, lady finger and bitter gourd  to the change in political environment, calling it the Modi phenomenon, the farmers have been denying this and are instead calling it a play of nature.On the reason behind the fall in prices, primarily ever since the general election had entered its last leg, Ashok, a wholesale trader, said: The production by and large has been three times more than last year.Due to the increased production, the traders said the prices are significantly lower for many of the vegetables like onion, tomato and gourds than what they are around this time of the year.On how the prices of onion stabilised despite about 40 per cent of the crop being destroyed due to bad weather, Ashok said: Onion is exported to countries like Pakistan, Colombo, Singapore, Malaysia and Dubai. The exports have come down while the supply has become more regular from Rajasthan, and Pune and Nasik in Maharashtra because of which it is being sold at the rate of 10-14 rupees per kg.Similarly, tomato is being sold at low rates of 4 to 5 rupees per kg. On the other hand, potato prices have gone up from Rs.10 to Rs.25 per kg over the last two months.Another vegetable trader, Lalit, said: Farmers preferred to grow tomatoes this season in place of other vegetables, hoping to earn more than last year. As such there has been over supply.As for the green vegetables, traders insist that the weather has remained favourable and this has resulted in surplus production. Ghiya or gourd is currently selling at Rs.4 per kg in wholesale and has seen a 50 per cent decline; Karela or bitter gourd has also come down from Rs.12-15 per kg to Rs.4-7 rupees per kg since last month and lady finger is being sold at Rs.8 per kg.Parvinder Bhalla, a wholesale trader at Azadpur Mandi, said following recent storms, the prices are expected to go up. After the storm, prices are expected to shoot up in a week. However, major changes will be noticed in the coming weeks, following monsoon in early June, he added.It also emerged that it is the middlemen who are making profits while the farmers continue to toil hard to cover their basic costs.For their part, the traders also insist that the margins this year have been less due to various counts. One, the prices have reduced and secondly the sales are relatively lower. The vegetable produce has almost doubled this year in comparison to last year but a significant reduction has been observed in the overall sale. This is primarily due to mixed factors like increased inflow of vegetables produced locally from Panipat, Sonepat, Ghaziabad and Gurgaon, low quantum of exports due to poor quality of produce and a resultant reduction in prices, said a wholesaler."

The exports have come down while the supply has become more regular from Rajasthan, and Pune and Nasik in Maharashtra because of which it is being sold at the rate of 10-14 rupees per kg.Similarly, tomato is being sold at low rates of 4 to 5 rupees per kg. On the other hand, potato prices have gone up from Rs.10 to Rs.25 per kg over the last two months.Another vegetable trader, Lalit, said: Farmers preferred to grow tomatoes this season in place of other vegetables, hoping to earn more than last year. As such there has been an over supply.As for the green vegetables, the traders insist that the weather has remained favourable and this has resulted in surplus production."

Prattipadu and Tatiparthi villages near here have launched the sale of farm fresh vegetables at the doorstep.Green Van is the concept launched in unison by 21 farmers from the two villages, who own one hectare land each and have converted it to cultivate vegetables such as brinjal, ladyfinger, cauliflower, drumstick, bitter guard, potato and onion. All of them joined hands to launch Mahatma Gandhi Vegetable Growers Society to market their produce in a better way.This is to curtail the middlemen system in the vegetable market sector. As we have more produce of different varieties, we can go to the customers directly and offer them farm fresh vegetables at a remunerative price, says Oota Venkata Ramana, president of the society.The society procured a motor van by spending Rs. 4.85 lakh, in which Rs. 2 lakh has been provided as subsidy by the Horticulture department under the assistance of vegetable assistance under clusters scheme. At present we are operating our van in Pithapuram and Gollaprolu areas. Our plan is to popularise the society and accept bulk orders to supply vegetables at a remunerative price for marriages other functions, Mr. Venkata Ramana explains.Amenable conditionsSince Pithapuram and Gollaprolu areas are famous for vegetable cultivation and the soil is suitable for a wide range of vegetables, more and more vegetable farmers are coming forward to form societies. We have received applications from six societies so far seeking financial assistance to buy the mobile vans. This direct sale of vegetables is quite different from the Rythu Bazaar concept, as the society members fix the price of vegetables here, but not the officers of any department, says T.V. Cyril, Horticulture Officer, Peddapuram.A minimum of 13 farmers owning 20 hectares of cultivable land can form a society and avail the financial assistance from the department. This scheme is going to be a win-win proposition for both the farmers and the general public. It will also increase the vegetable production over a period of time, explains Mr. Cyril."

While Murthy urged young people to embrace technology, Shiva exhorted them to turn back to agriculture-to grow their own food, sans chemicals or machinery.Speaking at the same event on Tuesday, Narayana Murthy said India needed to follow China's example of shifting 95% of its workforce from agriculture to manufacturing, with focus on exporting all products manufactured. He also pointed out that countries dependent on agriculture recorded low GDP and low capita income, and as a result, citizens had low purchasing power and remained poor.""Mr Murthy has spoken about the need to reduce farmers in the country-but we must realize that these are human beings who cannot be thrown to waste. The GDP is falling because farmers are not getting a fair income; they are trapped in a negative economy that does not give them the fair price for their produce,"" said Shiva, citing the example of an MNC that uses local farmers to grow its potatoes in West Bengal. ""The company supplies the farmers with seeds, poisonous fertilizers and pesticides to grow potatoes, so it can manufacture potato chips. But for every twenty rupee-packet of chips consumed, the farmers growing the potatoes do not even get 20 paise-1% return is what Indian farmers get today,"" she said.""Contrary to popular belief, corporate-driven farming that uses chemical fertilizers, toxic pesticides and genetically-modified seeds does not produce 'higher yield' but cultivates hunger and malnutrition,"" claimed Shiva.Quoting research findings of the air, soil and water pollution caused by chemical fertilizers, she said, ""In our system of chemical-based agriculture, 10 units of input produce 1 unit of output-the only reason it has not collapsed is because it runs on billion-dollar government subsidies,"" she said, pointing out that 75% of all food crops are produced by small, individual farmers. ""The factory farms are not interested in cultivating food for human consumption, they look for whatever is most profitable-- 90% of corn and soya grown globally goes for chicken and cattle feed; as raw materials for another industry,"" she said.True to her stand against globalization Shiva also took on Murthy's support of Foreign Direct Investment in retail, as a means to boost India's economy. ""Indians are already experts in retail, and we have thousands of successful retail outlets that create jobs. We do not need a Wal-mart to come in to create employment, and rob our farmers of their livelihood,"" she insisted."
72,Vegetable Growers Claim Losses Due to Fall in Prices at Faridkot,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/vegetable-growers-claim-losses-due-to-fall-in-prices-at-faridkot/story-sHkNIUEYRSSxgNbKNF1MaJ.html,2014-06-09,Hindustan Times,"A small increase in the area under vegetables in the district has led to more production than the demand in the local market, which has resulted in the fall of prices and many farmers are claiming to be incurring losses on vegetables this season.I had grown okra (bhindi) over 4 kanals, but now within a few days, prices have fallen to less than Rs 500 per quintal at which we cannot recover the cost of even daily picking labour, said Gagandeep Singh Gaggi, a farmer from Duareana village.I have spent too much in raising the crop by buying costly hybrid seeds but have earned little. So, sensing the loss, I have stopped picking them while the crop has just matured to yield maximum, he said. Gagandeep has now decided to plough his standing okra crop.The vegetable-growing has no much profit now as the local markets are small and there is no other alternative for the sale of vegetables. Most of time, after unexpected rise of prices of some vegetables, people go after growing them without much understanding of the marketing that leads to a glut and prices crash badly, said Gurmeet Singh Mann, a farmer from Bukan Singh Nagar, Kotkapura, who has been in vegetable-growing for many years.The input costs have risen too much on vegetable-growing as it is more labour-intensive crop in comparison to the traditional crops. These days, most of the seasonal vegetables are selling at less than `500 per quintal in the wholesale market, which is leading to the loss to vegetable growers, Gurmeet claimed.The area under potatoes had increased in the district and after potatoes; many people grew vegetables in the fields vacated by the crop. Some have grown fodder and sathi mung, said Jaswant Singh, a farmer from Panjgrain Kalan village.My relatives had also grown vegetables but they have already abandoned them due to low prices, he said. Some of the vegetable-growers from landless communities are reportedly suffering big loss because they have hired land for about `15,000 to 20,000 per acre till June 15.The farmers should try to keep a tab on the market trends and avoid running after a particular vegetable due to the rates in last season. They can also form groups or market individually directly to earn more profit leaving out the middle man and third parties, said Dr Amandeep Keshav, project director ATMA Faridkot (agriculture technology management agency).Gradation and processing, if possible, of the vegetables should be tried to market the produce in a different way to carve a niche in the competitive market, Keshav said.Farmers now need to adopt some other techniques such as growing vegetables in poly houses/net houses, which can control the temperature to some extent and save the crop from insect attacks. Thus early or late crops of vegetables, when they are in demand can earn them handsome profit, said Kirandeep Singh Gill, horticulture development officer Faridkot."
73,Jamva avo: NaMo introduces India to the many flavours of Gujarat,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/jugglebandhi/jamva-avo-namo-introduces-india-to-the-many-flavours-of-gujarat/,2014-06-12,The Times Of India,"Dilli is all agog with learning a whole lot of new words. For instance, theres dhokla. And thepla. And khakhra. And gathiya. And khandvi. What on earth is khandvi? Is it an acronym for a new social and economic uplift programme for the vulnerable sections of society? Could it be Kisan Harit Andolan National Development Vikas Initiative? Is it a new political grouping? Is it a scheme initiated by the government designed to unearth the black money stashed in foreign bank accounts and bring it all back to India?Khandvi is none of these things. Along with dhokla, thepla, khakhra and gathiya, khandvi is what in Gujarati is often referred to as a snake. Snake not as in cobra or python. But snake as in something to eat, a light titbit. Often, though not always, of a savoury nature.Thanks to the Narendra Modi-led government, north Indianised Delhi is picking up not only a new vocabulary but also acquiring a new menu, which is a distinct departure from its usual butter masala and paneer tikka bill of fare.Dilliwallahs, and not just those in political circles, are beginning to learn the difference between a batata vada and an undhiyu (one is a mashed potato patty dipped in batter and deep fried, and the other is a sort of casserole of spiced mixed vegetables, cooked in a sealed pot, preferably in Surat, and with an extra dash of oil in it to give it that added zing.)Almost all Gujaratis  including Gir lions  are vegetarians by choice. And not just vegetarians, but selective vegetarians in that not a few will avoid even vegetables like mushrooms, which have a chewy, suspiciously meaty texture.As a result of such fastidiousness, Gujarati cuisine has had to make itself highly innovative in creating a range of flavoursome dishes using relatively limited ingredients. Such maximization of minimalist sources is also evident in the Gujarati idiom, in its style of verbal communication.For example, the monosyllabic interrogative Su? can convey a wealth of meanings. While basically Su? is the Gujarati equivalent of the English So?, it contains many more nuances than its Angrezi synonym.The succinct Su? can mean How has the world and life in general been treating you since last we met? It can mean Whats todays rate of interest on short-term loans? (All Gujaratis, from age five onwards, know the days rate of interest, along with their ABCs and 123s.)Su? can be an elicitation, inviting an opinion or point of view different from that which you hold, as in You dont agree that the going rate of interest on short-term loans is 15%? Or You dont think the perfect unidhyu should have beans as well as peas in it?An equally pithy substitute for Su? is Kem?. Kem? can do duty for Su? in many situations, besides being a form of greeting, as in Yo bro, howre they hanging? The appropriate response to Kem? is Maja ma, which broadly speaking translates into Yes, we are having fun already, and Gods in his heaven, and alls right with the world.Thanks to the new PM, not just Delhi but the whole of India has been invited to a feast of all things Gujarati, which is what Jamva avo means. Its an invitation thats hard not to accept. Not least because the person extended it has a way of making people eat not just dhokla but also humble pie, if necessary."

He used non-conventional animal feeds like maize cobs, palm oil mill effluent, de oiled palm kermal case and urea treated palm pressed fibre etc to minimize the milk production cost.Khobragade, 65, known popularly as the HMT man, belongs to Nagbhid taluka in Chandrapur district. A school drop out after the Std III, he took up paddy cultivation. He noticed different looking spikes in his Patel 3 variety field and thus was born the HMT rice. When he realized the high yields he preserved the seeds and grew them separately in his fields. Then over years he continued growing these and through selection method developed the HMT rice.Rambhau Dhage from Nashik, began his journey from a small nursery in 1089 sq ft field with an investment of Rs30,000 in 2006. He started with just 15,000 saplings of different vegetables and took it to 15 lakh saplings. Now, he owns a farm of 35 acres and grows grapes and vegetables. He has also started a fishery business in just a acre of pond and has an annual production of 2000kg of Rohu, Katla fish. Recently he ventured into dairy.Singh from Bhatinda grows potatoes on 35 acres of land and unlike other farmers does not burn the post harvest waste. Two years back he created a machine for crushing the waste and mixing it with the soil with help of a local mechanic. This reduced pollution and requirement of chemical fertilizers substantially thereby leading to low cost production. Today, the machine created by him costs 2.5 lakh. But he sells them to farmers on subsidy at Rs1 lakh.Lepcha from Sikkim believes in 'organic farming' and has managed to increase the production of cardamom manifold by using vermicompost and cow urine. He took training and guidance from the Sikkim horticulture department ATMA etc. He now produces 500kg of cardamom annually."

Officials are considering giving subsidised diesel and cheaper loans to farmers.The persistent stickiness in inflation has also dimmed the chances of an interest rate cut in the next policy review by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In its second bi-monthly monetary policy statement earlier this month, the RBI had said a faster-than-anticipated fall in inflation can only provide headroom for easing rates.The RBI is aiming at a glide path of 8 per cent consumer price inflation by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016. Although the RBI is closely watching the CPI-led inflation as a nominal anchor, WPI data points play an equally important role while formulating the monetary policy.Concerned over the rise in food inflation, industry chamber CII said the government should implement the APMC Act, develop advanced supply chains, rationalise subsidies, augment investment in agri-infrastructure and encourage FDI in retail.Assocham insisted on correcting supply chains. Supply chains are presently very long with numerous middlemen, a number of whom need to be shortened by connecting farmers directly to organised processors, retailers and exporters, it said. Ficci said it expected to see quick action from the government on food inflation.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, The government is seized by the matter and is committed to ease supply side constraints. Rise in prices could be because of withholding of stocks on account of apprehensions of weak monsoon, he said on Facebook. He asked the state governments to ensure speculative hoarding is discouraged.The market reacted negatively soon after inflation data was released. While the Sensex lost 100 points only to regain later in the day, the rupee breached the 60-mark to end at a six-week low of 60.16 to a dollars.According to Jaitley, The slight instability in rupee could be because of Iraq oil shocks and global fear of oil price rise."

Nasik is a major onion supplier to Jharkhand and onion prices are likely to go up if the strike continues.Nasik meets 40-50% of states demand of onions. So, prices will go up for sure, if supply reduces. We hope the strike ends in a day or two, said Deepak Kumar Gupta, a wholesale trader of potato and onions. Besides Nasik, Jharkhand also gets supply from Madhya Pradesh and local districts like Palamu.Manoj Kumar, an onion trader of RK Trading from Satana in Nasik, confirmed that the traders went on indefinite strike. Prices of potato and onions have already shot up to 53% in retail or vegetable markets compared to the wholesale market in Ranchi. However, currently there is no such shortage of the items in the city and price at wholesale market has been stable for the last 10 days.At present a kilogram potato or onion costs anything between Rs 20 to 22 in the retail or vegetable markets of the state capital, which was just around Rs 16 three days back. But, prices of the same items have been around Rs 13 to 14 for last 10 days in the wholesale markets at Pandra Krishi Bazar.Due to shortage of potato in Uttar Pradesh, its import to the state has stopped and we are depending on the supply from West Bengal. This is why, price of potato is soaring, said a potato-onion seller at Lalpur vegetable market.However, wholesale traders have denied any hitch in supply of these vegetables to the state capital. Supply of potato from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal is as usual. There was no snag in supply till Saturday and prices too were unchanged. A packet (50kg) of potato was sold at Rs 670 till Saturday, said Anil Gupta, president of Aloo-Pyaj Vikreta Sangh (APVS).Gupta, who is also a wholesale trader of potato and onion at Pandra Bazar, said, Arrival of onion was partially low at the mandi on Saturday but this shouldnt have had any effect on its price. Per kg price of onion was Rs 12 to Rs 14 depending upon the quality. However, if this situation persists, onion price may increase in coming weeks.Rate evaluator of Marketing Board, Sambhu Sharan Singh said that around 2000 quintals of potato and 800-1000 quintals of onion arrive in Ranchi every day from different parts of the country. There is no shortage of potato. But, onion supply has declined partially, Singh said."

This is the seventh such attack since 2001 on jute mills executives, Sanjay Kajaria, owner of several jute mills, said.The latest round of violence was triggered by workers fears of loss of wages due to a management proposal of cutting back on work hours due to paucity of demand.The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packing Commodities) Act, 1987, stipulating compulsory packaging of foodgrains, sugar, cement and fertiliser was passed by the Centre to help the jute industry.However, industry experts say that the shrinking sectors trouble began when the industry started treating a helpline as their mainstay. Any dilution in the mandatory portions sparked tension in the industry, which had failed to modernise and enhance their cost competitiveness vis-a-vis plastic bags.IJMA Chairman Raghav Gupta told The Hindu that this years problems could be traced to the overestimation of foodgrains during the rabi season (90 per cent of which should be packed in jute bags as per mandatory order), by the then UPA II government. This was repeated during a part of the kharif season, too.The jute industry geared up to meet a bolstered production target, which never materialised. This necessitated a 25-40 per cent production cut-back and losses on account of the raw jute which was purchased in anticipation of an increased order.It is with this end in view that the industry is seeking protection from the State government (where the industry is concentrated) by way of mandatory packaging of potatoes and rice  two commodities where West Bengal leads the country. This can boost demand significantly and perhaps help stem such violence, which is often fomented by outsiders, an industry source said."

The bad news came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned in Goa on Saturday: To improve the economic health of India, pull the country out of the current mess shouldnt we take some bitter decisions?In April, the rate of growth of the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) was 5.2 per cent; food price inflation had risen at the rate of 8.6 per cent. The pick-up in food inflation was led primarily by higher poultry and milk prices, according to the official data released here on Monday. Wholesale prices of potato are up more than 40 per cent since March. The build up in wholesale inflation in vegetables since March is touching 18 per cent.Fuel inflation climbed to 10.5 per cent in May largely on the back of the Rs.1.3 a litre hike in diesel prices and the lagged revision in the electricity index. In April, the fuel price rate of inflation was 8.9 per cent.The wholesale price data dampened the feel-good that the easing of retail price inflation in May to 8.3 per cent from 8.6 per cent in the previous month had generated. The official release also said that the rate of WPI rise for March has been revised up to 6 per cent from 5.7 per cent.In the near-term, the upside risks to inflation not only come from monsoons, but also from recent spike in crude on tensions in Iraq, said Citigroup Indias chief economist Rohini Malkani in a report on the latest inflation data. The report, however, also pointed out that the statistical base effect will turn favourable June onwards.Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said in a statement that the spike in WPI inflation in May was a cause for concern. Containing the spiral of rising price pressures is of utmost importance to revive industrial production, especially as persistent inflation has caused the interest rate to follow a tight trajectory and has added to the cost of capital for industry, he said pointing out the adverse impact of inflation on economic growth.FICCI President Sidharth Birla echoed the caution: Inflation remains a key impeding factor to the overall growth prospects of the economy With food and fuel prices being the key driving factors the upside risks to inflation continues.The sub-par monsoon outlook for this year could put pressure on food prices going ahead.The CII recommended a multi-pronged approach for tackling inflation, including the implementation of a model APMC Act."

The current rise in prices of onion, potato and other products has been in anticipation of a sub-normal monsoon, in addition to the violence in Iraq and rising oil prices.To check the price movement in cereals, the government is expected to immediately release about 50 lakh tonnes of rice in the open market. Moreover, state governments will be given a line of credit to import pulses and edible oil directly if the need arises.The finance minister also said that a decision on Minimum Export Price for potato would be announced by the Commerce Ministry to curb its exports and bring down domestic prices.The new government, which has placed inflation control as its foremost priority, is currently facing the highest-ever price rise in essential commodities, including food, since December."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept to power last month on the promise of lowering prices and reviving the economy growing at its slowest since 1980s.If prices remain at elevated levels, Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan, who indicated in his monetary policy on June 3 a willingness to consider a rate cut to kick start sputtering growth, will find it difficult to give up his hawkish stance on curbing inflation. Result: EMIs are unlikely to come down in the near future.Rising wholesale prices negated the feel-good factor that was beginning to emerge following last week's data that showed retail inflation easing to 8.28% in May and industrial output rising to a 13-month high of 3.4% in April.Reflecting the negative mood, the BSE Sensex fell for a second straight session to its lowest close in 1-1/2 weeks after the release of the inflation on Monday, although some risk-aversion also hit the market due to the crisis in Ukraine and Iraq. The rupee also hit a 1-1/2 month low during the day.Food inflation rose sharply to 8.58% in May compared to 7.06% in April, fuelled mainly by high inflation in potatoes (up 31.44%), fruits (up 19.4%), rice (up 12.75%) and meat, fish & eggs (up 12.47%).""Tackling food inflation should take centre stage in order to bring growth back to the economy,"" said Chandrajit Banerjee, director general, CII.Deficient rains, as forecast by the meteorological office this year, could hurt farm output, especially pushing up prices of vegetables, fruits and dairy products. India has ample rice, wheat and sugar stocks to tide over any shortage this year.Crude prices have risen to a nine-month high on anxiety over possible disruption in supplies from Iraq, where Sunni insurgents were advancing toward Baghdad as part of a campaign to establish a new Islamic Caliphate in Middle East. If crude prices keep rising, India's oil import bill, which stood at $160 billion (`9.6 lakh crore) last year, could shoot up further.Higher demand for dollars by oil importers could lead to the US currency appreciating against the rupee, making all imports more expensive, thus, fuelling inflation and increasing India's now-under-control current account deficit (CAD - the difference between dollar inflows and outflows in the economy).This will hit hopes of an early economic recovery. A soaring CAD last year had led to the rupee falling to 68.85 against the dollar and set off a global crisis of confidence in the Indian economy."

A shortfall in supply is either due to hoarding or mismanagement by onion-producing States, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told The Hindu .A sluggish south-west monsoon and rising inflation on account of food and fuel prices have alarmed the government. Onion prices have shot up to about Rs. 35 from Rs. 15 a kg a fortnight ago. The prices of potatoes and tomatoes have also spiralled.The spike in inflation came even before the effects of the projected deficient rains and possible Iraq-related hike in global oil prices began to kick in.The rise in prices of food articles can also be attributed to withholding of stocks on account of apprehension of a weak monsoon, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had posted on Facebook late on Monday. The State Government(s) should take effective steps to ensure that speculative hoarding is discouraged.Over the weekend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned that bitter medicine was needed to put Indias economy back on track, without giving details.There is an urgency in the government circles to tackle the situation as elections are round the corner in Maharashtra, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand and possibly Delhi. Last year, just before the Assembly elections in Delhi, onion prices shot up to Rs. 100 per kg taking down the Congress government.Mr. Radha Mohan Singh attended a meeting convened by Mr. Jaitley to review measures for containing inflation. Earlier, the Prime Ministers Office also convened a meeting with departments concerned on measures taken to tackle food inflation.Onion prices have also started rising as supplies have been hit due to a strike by loaders in Nasik in Maharashtra. Union Agriculture Secretary Ashish Bahuguna on Tuesday spoke to his counterpart in Maharashtra requesting him to prevent hoarding and resolve the dispute between strikers and the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee.Onion production this year is 192.98 lakh tonnes as against 168.13 lakh tonnes in 2012-13. Potato output is 46.6 lakh tonnes compared to 45.3 lakh tonnes while tomato production is 191.03 lakh tonnes this year against 182.27 lakh tonnes. Last year, 13.58 lakh tonnes of onion were exported as against 18.22 lakh tonnes the previous year.Mr. Singh said onion prices shot up by 29 per cent in Mumbai and 13 per cent in Delhi within a week due to shortage in mandi arrivals. However, the steps taken by the government will bring down the prices, he said."

Vegetable vendors in the city said there may be a further increase soon as there has been a shortage of onions in the market for a fortnight.While onions now cost Rs.25 per kg from just Rs.10 a kg two weeks ago, the green beans have shot up from Rs.40 to Rs.100 a kg compared to weeks ago!Cluster beans, ridge gourd, tomato, cabbage, cucumber, carrot, and potatoes have also become costly, creating a bigger hole in the pockets of citizens. Vegetable vendors at Monda Market in Secunderabad said that the price rise may stop once monsoon begins. A wholesale onion trader at Monda Market, on condition of anonymity, said that the ongoing strike by onion traders in Nashik, Maharashtra, also may contribute to the hike of onion prices. Gajanand, vice-president, Monda Market Retailers Association, explained that more than 60 per cent of the vegetable stock comes from Andhra Pradesh, and that lesser stock has been arriving from the last two weeks.The production of vegetables in Telangana is less. Since monsoons have not begun, the extreme heat has resulted in low productivity, Gajanand said, and added that once rainy season sets in the State, the situation will improve."

File PhotoThe onion price in Bangalore has gone up by nearly Rs. 10 a kilo in the wholesale market over the last fortnight and is likely to increase further, according to onion traders at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). The retail price of good quality onion, which was in the range of Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 a kilo, is now above Rs. 25.The increase, they say, is due to a shortage of supply from Maharashtra even as supply from Karnataka has almost come to an end. While a quintal of onion was traded between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 1,200 till about the beginning of June, it is currently being traded around Rs. 2,500. S. Balakrishna, vice-president of Bangalore Onion and Potato Merchants Association, said that the current price is almost comparable to that in the corresponding period last year when heavy rainfall damaged crops. A quintal of good quality onion last June cost about Rs. 3,000.The price, Mr. Balakrishna said, could go up further during marriage season when demand for good quality onion goes up. The big onion used in hotels and marriages come to us from Maharashtra. The current stock may not be sufficient to meet the demand, he said, adding that high prices may prevail till August-September when fresh stock will come from Karnataka."

The trend was the same last month too. The highest price for onion has not crossed Rs.25 in the wholesale market, said Rajender Sharma, former chairman of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee.Mr. Sharma said while most of the vegetables are selling in the price range they were in about a month ago, tomato has in fact hit a low with one kilogram available at Rs.3 to Rs.5. Supply of vegetables to the wholesale market has also seen a spurt this year. ""The monsoon this year has resulted in high yields, flooding the markets with fresh fruits and vegetables. Thus supply has been more than adequate this season.A wholesale market official said he was expecting a dip in prices after July 10. Explaining the reasons for the same, he noted: The prices are usually low at the start of the harvest. The prices usually witness a hike only after the grading of the vegetable. Once it ages and obtains a certain size and shape, the demand goes up.Apprehensions related to cartelisation and hoarding of the yield was dismissed by the officials at the mandi who said ""stocking"" should not be confused with hoarding.Cartelisation of vegetables and fruits is not really possible because of their perishable nature. For example, potato is not harvested beyond mid-July. In such a case, it is important to stock the harvest for future demand. This is not hoarding, said an official."

Among these, the worst affected are the onion prices that has shot up to 75 per cent from Rs 15-20 to Rs 30-35 per kg, within a week.With the shortage of onion supply added with poor quality produce not fit for long duration storage and the prediction of below normal monsoon, this is expected to further escalate the prices in the coming weeks across the state.The worst affected cities with high onion prices are Surat where it is the highest at a retail price of Rs 33-35 per kg, followed by Vadodara and Ahmedabad where retail vendors sell it at Rs 25-30 per kilogram. In Rajkot, it is sold in retail market at Rs 15 per kg.Similar increase is witnessed in the wholesale prices of onion within a period of last 10 days. At Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), it shot up from Rs 6-15 on June 9 to Rs 10-20 per kg on June 20.Among reasons cited by traders and experts for this sudden increase in prices of onion is a shortfall in supply due to the unseasonal rainfall with hailstorm that was witnessed in Maharashtra a few months ago. This resulted in a damage to onion, potato and tomato produce.With nearly 80 per cent of the produce in Maharashtra that got damaged with unseasonal rainfall and hailstorm, there is a 25-30 per cent shortage in the stock received from farmers and traders. For instance, a farmer who was expected to have 500 packets of onion is left with only 100. Thus, shortage in supply is resulting in increase in prices, said Kishore Paryani, wholesale vendor of onion at Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Vasna in Ahmedabad.Further, the unseasonal rainfall and hailstorm in onion producing areas had also affected its quality. The quality of onion that is coming this season is sub standard. This will certainly create a problem for hoteliers who require to store it in bulk, said APMC Ahmedabad Secretary Dipak Patel.The prices are expected to increase in the coming days. During the rainy season, the supply of onion, potato and tomato will be affected as a result of which the prices would be doubled. The prices are expected to start increasing from July 15 onwards.

93,First global village? The story of Anjuna,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/First-global-village-The-story-of-Anjuna/articleshow/30869900.cms,2014-06-23,The Times Of India,"Visitors to Oxford Arcade supermarket in Anjuna quickly glimpse an exciting, highly cosmopolitan future that is quietly being made for Goa, and possibly eventually the rest of the country.Like many other stores of its kind, Oxford displays a number of imported products for sale. But far more than any other, it has also become a showcase for artisanal foods made right here in Goa by foreigners. The high quality and sheer variety of this new kind of ""local produce"" has to be seen to be believed.There's beautifully bottled strawberry, pineapple, and banana/orange jams made in Goa from a ""French traditional recipe."" In another aisle, more than a dozen varieties of freshly-baked bread: crisp baguettes made by a Belgian, heavy German-made sauerteigbrot (sourdough bread), lots of brioches, croissants and pain au chocolat.In one fridge's shelves, a cornucopia of cheeses made in nearby Siolim by the Swiss Happy Cow company: ricotta, real mozzarella di bufala, camembert, blue cheese, and a soft 'Tomme de Goa' which comes studded with walnuts, or capers, or green pepper, or garlic and chili flakes. Next to Israeli-made hummus there is Russian-style smoked kingfish, to be eaten in bites like tapas alongside the pickled cabbage and brined potatoes also available in neat packages.Oxford carries ravioli and several kinds of pasta sauce made in Pilerne, and many kinds of cereals and grains from an organic farm in Parra. A freezer shelf holds-almost miraculously-the best creme fraiche and sour cream you will find anywhere in India. Also made by Russians, up the coast in Morjim, these rarities are roughly the same price you could expect to pay in Europe, but a trip to Anjuna is certainly much shorter and cheaper!No less than the goods at this unusual supermarket, its clientele is wildly globalized. On a midday visit earlier this week, I heard at least nine languages in its lanes. Finnish natives brushed shoulders with Farsi speakers, and two young Afghans stood ahead in line while I chatted with Mendel, an equally young, orthodox Jewish Lubavitcher from Brooklyn who sported his knotted tzitzit (ritual fringe) with as much aplomb as the Japanese woman at the opposite register tossed her dreadlocks.All this may seem very new. But like the rest of Goa, Anjuna has always been at the vanguard of what is now called globalization. Across the road from Oxford is a multi-turreted mansion that is an exact replica of the royal palace of Zanzibar, erected by a team of African craftsmen sent by the Sultan in gratitude to his personal physician, Manuel de Albuquerque. This son of Anjuna earned distinctions in Bombay, Edinburgh, Dublin and Brussels in the late nineteenth century, before spending decades as consul general of Portugal to Zanzibar.Delving even further back, historian Teresa Albuquerque (a daughter-in-law of Anjuna) reports that the village's name is derived from the Arabic word 'Hanjuman' (meaning merchant guild). More than a thousand years ago it was ""a prosperous Arab commercial settlement and an important port along the west coast."" Nearby Chapora (Shah pura) ""had for long been a vital maritime hub. It was once a gateway to the holy city of Mecca and many ships were anchored, repaired and even built there. To Chapora came Arab dhows loaded with horses bound for the great market at Pernem, across the creek.""With that kind of history, it is no surprise that the first motley crews of hippies from the West found themselves exceedingly comfortable in Anjuna in the late 1960's and early 1970's. The original 'Goa Freaks' blazoned a trail beginning in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury that meandered through Western Europe, Afghanistan and Kathmandu before winding up in these same coconut groves. All those other places have changed beyond recognition, but that's not the case here in Goa, where a wildly multi-racial, multi-lingual and multinational mix of 'outsiders' mingles visibly happily and peacefully with the 'insiders' of Anjuna, resulting in many positive by-products that include the remarkable smorgasbord of delicacies available at Oxford Arcade.In recent months, Goa has been largely unfairly, and often maliciously, portrayed in the media (especially the Delhi-based outlets) as a hotbed of the kind of narrow-minded xenophobia that characterizes much of the rest of India. After centuries-indeed millennia-of world renown for open-mindedness, tolerance and extraordinary hospitality, there is a worrisome trend of stories about Goans turning nastily against Nigerians, Russians, even ""budget travelers.""But even a short visit to places like Anjuna, demonstrates that the truth is far different. Don't believe the hype about Bangalore et al, India's cosmopolitan future is quietly developing right here on Goa's coastline. And that's just the way it always has been.The writer is a well-published author and photographer"

Though there are indications that the prices will go up further, the UT administration has stepped in to keep a check on the prices and hoarding, if any, of onion as well as potatoes.The traders from the Sector-26 grain market say disruption in supply of onion and potatoes remains the major reason behind the price hike. They maintained that there is no hoarding and the prices have risen as the demand is much more than the supply. The main supply of onion comes from Nasik in Maharashtra. Owing to the unseasonal rain and hailstorm, the crop has been affected, resulting in the reduced supply as compared to the demand.At the main vegetable market in Sector 26, the prices are still under control. While the wholesale price per kg has been Rs 22 and the retail rate is Rs 28, regular vendors are charging much more and there is no mechanism to regulate the same. Regular vendors are selling onion at Rs 35 a kg and the new crop of potatoes for Rs 30 per kg. The prices with the local vendors about a fortnight ago were Rs 25 and Rs 20 per kg, for onion and potatoes, respectively.Satya Gopal, secretary, food and civil supplies and consumer affairs, UT, also held a meeting on the prices of onion on Saturday. While chairing the meeting, he said though there is no panic in Chandigarh regarding the availability of onion or potatoes and their prices, the administration should be ready to control the prices of these commodities.He had stated that the administration will be conducting raids to ensure that there is no hoarding of these commodities at the Sector-26 grain market."

Picture by Ashwinee Patibibhuti Barik Bhubaneswar, June 22: After vegetables, its the turn of chicken and mutton in the city to skyrocket. Chicken, which was being sold at Rs 140 a kilo a week ago, has reached Rs 180 and mutton, which was selling at Rs 400 a kilo, has now climbed to Rs 440. Sabyasachi Das, a resident of Lingaraj Vihar at Pokhariput, said: Todays market rate for chicken and mutton at the Sundarpada market was a real shocker. Meat sellers were charging Rs 440 a kilo. Marriage season pushes up price marginally, but such a stiff hike hurts us. Prices of vegetables have already gone up after a hike in petrol and diesel. Now, railway fares have been increased and it will add to the rising prices. Prices of vegetables, potato and onion are going up daily, he said. Sajid Khan, who sells chicken at Pokhariput, said: The suppliers have started minimising their supply and we are depending on hatcheries in and around the city, mostly those in Khurda and Puri district. Once the demand-supply gap narrows down, the rate will fall. Kalu Khan, a mutton seller at Unit IV Market, said: The mutton price has increased due to short supply of animals from the traditional supply areas. We mainly get mutton from Jashipur in Mayurbhanj, Nayagarh, Daspallah, Kandhamal and nearby Khurda, but the sudden change in weather conditions has hit the supply line, hence the rate has increased. While some meat sellers claim that the shortage in supply of mutton has led to the sudden rise in price, a leader of the butchers organisation Sheikh Sarjan Qureshi says that those selling the product for more than Rs 420 a kilo is charging extra. Qureshi said those who claimed that higher price meant better quality were actually duping and exploiting the buyers. He said that people should not pay more than the current market rate. On an average day, the city consumes 1.25 quintal of mutton. It goes up to 3 to 3.5 quintal on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. Similarly for chicken, the consumption level varies between 1.5 and 4 quintals. Fish merchant Seikh Mustafa, however, said: Rohu is still being sold between Rs 120 and Rs 140 depending on its size. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporations mega plan to have multiple slaughterhouses in the city and modern meat and fish shops at Unit IV might help in regulating the price in future. With most shops coming under one roof, the variation in price will be less likely to happen. The slaughter house plan for Gadakana has been sent for administrative approval and the proposal for a mega facility project at Rudrapur is before the state government for consideration.

101,"Advisory, not tall order, on potato price",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140625/jsp/bengal/story_18548331.jsp,2014-06-25,Telegraph,"Calcutta, June 24: The state governments request to traders to peg the price of potatoes at Rs 14 a kg in the retail market has brought back memories of last years intervention, which had led to a demand-supply mismatch and a consequent spike in rates. As this year the government has confined itself to issuing an advisory, which is not binding on traders, the Jyoti variety sold at prices between Rs 18 and Rs 20 in Calcuttas markets today. An official said it was not possible for traders to sell the tuber at the rate prescribed by the government. The government should have taken steps to keep the price in check when potatoes were being harvested, he added. Senior agriculture marketing department officials said there was lack of planning despite last years crisis  when the price of potatoes had gone up to Rs 23 a kg. Last year, a notification was issued, pegging the maximum retail price of potatoes at Rs 13 a kg. But no such notification was issued this time as the government has realised that it is not possible to sell potatoes at Rs 14 a kg this year, another official said. According to the officials, potatoes were sold at Rs 9 a kg from the field this year. A crop bought by traders for Rs 9 a kg will cost Rs 5 more when it is brought out of the cold storage. The sum is added to the base price as storage, shrinkage, insurance, wastage and labour charges, a cold storage owner in Hooghly said. The price increases further on the way to the market from the storage. The price of potatoes goes up by Rs 4 when it reaches the retail market because of the ferrying cost and the profits cornered by wholesalers and retailers. This is the reason why potatoes are being sold at prices between Rs 18 and Rs 20 a kg, a potato trader said. A member of a cold storage owners association said: If the government forces traders to sell potatoes at a lower price, it could lead to hoarding. This would lead to a shortage in supply and result in price rise. The officials said that to keep the price in check, the government should have bought potatoes and stored them so that they could be sold through fair price shops in case of a crisis. He said had the state government stored potatoes after buying them at Rs 9 a kg from the field, it could have made the tuber available through ration shops at the same price. The government can sell potatoes on a no profit-no loss basis. Potato traders feel that because of the governments wrong intervention in the market, the base price of the tuber increased to Rs 9 a kg this year from Rs 6 a kg last year. Last October, the government had issued a blanket ban on the export of the produce to other states. Many potato traders suffered losses because of this. Soon after the fresh produce was harvested this time, traders tried to recover last years losses by selling potatoes to other states in large quantities. This increased the base price, an official said."
102,A huge challenge,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/415900/a-huge-challenge.html,2014-06-25,Deccan Herald,"A huge challengeAlok Ray, Jun 26, 2014 : 22:51 ISTThe success or failure of the Modi government, in popular perception, will be judged in terms of taming the beast of food inflation.If one has to mention one issue which was most responsible for the defeat of UPA, it has to be the chronic food inflation. Slow growth rate of GDP is just a number to most people as they do not see the connection between slow growth and rising unemployment. But rising food prices hurt them all the time. Consequently, the success or failure of the Modi-led BJP government in popular perception will be principally judged in terms of its success or otherwise in taming the beast of food inflation.There is another problem of perception here. Most people fail to realise that even when the rate of inflation comes down, prices may still go up. For example, if the price level changes from 100 to 110 and then moves to 118, the rate of inflation has come down from 10 per cent to 7.27 per cent. Most people would still be complaining about the persistence of high inflation and the failure of the government.Therefore, if the success in containing inflation has to be registered in peoples mind, there has be a substantial fall in the rate of inflation. The government has already announced a few steps to bring down food inflation (currently it is more than 9 per cent per year). It wants to be pro-active as monsoon rainfall is feared to be below normal this year. The steps include a rise in the minimum export price (MEP) of onions and potatoes (which would reduce exports, increase domestic availability and hence reduce prices), offering credit to states to directly import pulses and edible oils to meet shortages (which would add to supply in the domestic market and bring down prices), releasing five million tonnes of rice from the FCI godowns to depress grain prices in the market, selling onions through fair price shops, advising states to delist fruits and vegetables from Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act so that these can be sold and transported anywhere by the growers directly, and exhorting the administration to crack down on hoarders in anticipation of a supply shortfall due to sub-normal monsoon.On the flip side, the tough decision by the new government to gradually raise diesel prices to international levels and to raise rail freight rates would exert some upward pressure on prices by adding to transport and cold storage costs. The trouble in Iraq may add further to international oil price and hence to prices in India.In any case all these measures are short term steps which should produce some downward pressure on these specific food articles but would not touch the root causes of rising food prices  specially of superior foods like vegetables, fruits, milk, fish, eggs and meat. The root cause lies in the steadily rising demand-supply gap for the non-grain food articles. The growth in income  specially income of the poorer sections in the rural economy in the form of MGNREGS  is increasing the demand for the superior varieties of food as people with higher incomes are switching from basic grains to better quality foods. On the other hand, steadily rising MSP (Minimum Support Price) and open-ended procurement by government agencies is making cultivation of grains a safe bet for farmers. For example, in the first half of the last decade, the MSP for paddy was raised by about 10 per cent while the same went up by about 75 per cent in the second half. A similar trend prevailed for wheat.Producing more grainsThus, agricultural land (whose availability is shrinking due to urbanisation and industrialisation) is being diverted to produce more grains whereas the demand is switching the other way. Yet, grain price in the market is rising because of rising MSP and ever-mounting stocks of foodgrains in FCI godowns (much above the prudential buffer stock norms) where the government becomes the biggest hoarder of grains. At the same time, there is a huge wastage of perishable agricultural products, thanks to bad storage and transportation facilities. APMC Act gives monopoly rights to wholesale trade in agricultural produce to a few mandis and leads to price manipulation by creating artificial scarcity at times of production shortfall.Clearly, therefore, the long term solution would have to be rising productivity in non-grain food articles, cutting wastages through improving storage and transportation facilities and introducing competition by amending the APMC Act so that retailers get a choice of buying from mandis or directly from the farmers.Allowing FDI in retail could be one option which the BJP has ruled out. But, if APMC Act is appropriately amended, domestic big retailers can also play a similar role through mechanisms like contract farming. Both public and private investment needs to go up in rural infrastructure (power, irrigation, better seeds and farming techniques, cold storage, transportation) and the sharply rising trend of MSP for grains needs to be moderated. The grain stocks have to be held at strategic locations all over the country so that these can be sold quickly whenever prices spike.Restricting export when there is a domestic shortage -- though it may reduce inflation in the short run -- may aggravate the problem in the long run as farmers would shy away from producing these crops as they can not take advantage of profitable export opportunities. Foreign buyers would also regard Indian suppliers as unreliable and would look elsewhere.Politically, it is difficult to take out fruits and vegetables (however much the Modi government at the centre may want it) from the APMC Act as it falls under the jurisdiction of states. The mandi middlemen are big contributors of funds to political parties and some of them are also local leaders with significant political clout. The powerful lobby of big farmers would fight any attempt to flatten the rising MSP curve. It is to be seen whether the BJP, whose one major support base is small traders and big farmers, would muster the political will to bring about these long term reforms in the agricultural sector.(The writer is a former professor of economics, IIM, Calcutta)"

The model code is in force in the state since February 19 when Election Commission of India issued notification for the legislative council polls to be held in five graduate and six teachers' seats in the state. When TOI sought asked chief electoral officer Umesh Sinha about the grant announced by the chief minister, he said ""the mattered would be examined and referred to the ECI.""The chief minister on Wednesday announced a Rs 15-lakh annual grant to Maulana Azad Memorial Academy, Lucknow, at a function at his official residence. The model code says that no policy announcement or programmes can be initiated by government departments related to the constituents of the election. In this case, the programme was hosted by the chief minister. The government-aided memorial academy funds research theses in the field of education and national integration.According to the EC's mandate, no Central or state ministers should initiate a new policy or programme that could influence graduates - for instance promises of jobs or unemployment allowances -- or dealing with teachers as long as model code for council polls is in place. So, announcement of grant to an educational institution amounts to violation, feel experts.On Tuesday as well, Akhilesh laid the foundation stone of and inaugurated projects worth Rs 2,200 crore for the state. Sinha clarified that the chief minister's office had sought prior permission from the EC with regards to some official programmes in which the CM was to participate. Wednesday's announcement however did not have the EC's prior sanction. Education and health ministers Ram Govind Chaudhary and Ahmad Hasan also said the SP government would ensure more jobs for Shiksha Mitras, for which new advertisements would be placed, and 18% to 20% reservation for Muslims in the appointments as Ayush doctors.Meanwhile, Akhilesh cleared more than 40 projects in a meeting of the state cabinet on Wednesday, days before the Election Commission of India is to notify general elections in the country. With the focus clearly on mass-scale appeasement, Akhilesh and his team clear long pending decisions that they believe are likely to impact voting patterns. Among the major decisions, the state government has expanded the scope of the Rashtriya Swastha Bima Yojana (RSBY), with the new beneficiaries to be funded by the state coffers. Following Wednesday's decision, the scheme will bring under its ambit NREGS labourers who have worked for a minimum of 15 days in the previous fiscal, rickshaw pullers and sanitation staff. Till now, the scheme only covered those registered under the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category.Among other decisions, the cabinet approved a proposal for setting up a tiger reserve in Pilibhit. It also approved the implementation of the UP Potato Development Policy 2014 to increase the state's yield and production of potatoes. The decision in this regard was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, an official release said here. The cabinet also approved a policy for the development of IT Park, in addition to a proposal to start air services between different districts including services to Agra, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Meerut from the state capital. The government will also give rebate to scheduled and non-scheduled airlines for the purpose.The cabinet also approved travel by air or water for claiming Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) by government officials. In a fresh development for school going girls, the cabinet also cleared a proposal to distribute menstrual sanitary napkins free of cost to girls studying in government schools at a cost of Rs 19.74 crore to state exchequer. The scheme, officials said, is expected to check drop-out rate and increase confidence among school-going girls. The cabinet also approved a plan for the purchase, implementation and monitoring of the scheme."

In a release, Santam Singh Behru, national president of CIFA, said during the Lok Sabha poll campaign Modi had talked about implementing the Swaminathan commission report. Even the BJP manifesto had listed it as a promise, he said.However, Modi has let down farmers, who voted in large numbers to get MSP as per the Swaminathan panel report, Behru said, while criticising the SAD for remaining silent on issue. Apart from MSP, the NDA has also cheated farmers by increasing the prices of diesel, he added.Behru has also filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court for implementation of the Swaminathan commission report.Meanwhile, Lok Sabha member Dr Dharamvira Gandhi has also condemned the central government's decision to make a meagre increase of `50 for paddy MSP and termed it a joke. He demanded that prices of crops should be fixed as per the recommendations of the Swaminathan commission.Dr Gandhi said before the parliamentary elections, the BJP and SAD had advocated that prices of crops should be fixed as per the recommendations of the Swaminathan commission, but after coming to power at the Centre they started showing their real anti-farmer face. Now, anti-farmer export restrictions are being imposed on crops, he said.The Patiala MP said when the government did not provide any support price for potatoes and onions then it had no right impose such export restrictions on farmers. ""If the government really wants to protect the interest of consumers, it must ensure reasonable support price for crops and also ensure the timely procurement and storage of crops for supply at reasonable prices to the consumer,"" Dr Gandhi said.He asked if government has ever imposed such exports restrictions on corporate houses like Ambanis.

110,A bogeyman called onion hoarder,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/a-bogeyman-called-onion-hoarder/,2014-07-01,The Times Of India,"Come Friday, food ministers from different states will gather in Delhi to talk about onions, among other things. A pattern of events that used to play out in UPA years has surfaced within a month of Narendra Modi taking over as prime minister. The mysterious hoarder has once again become the culprit responsible for escalating prices of onions and potatoes.This sounds ominous. Every time UPA began to blame hoarders, it became an indirect admission of helplessness. If history is going to repeat itself, we had better prepare for another bruising round of vegetable inflation.Political parties in India fear a rise in price of onions and potatoes with good reason. Household consumption surveys show onions are the most widely consumed vegetable, with 96% of rural households and 91% of urban households consuming onions. Potatoes, while not as widely consumed as onions, happen to be draw in the highest amount of spending among vegetables.Given how sensitive the price trend in these vegetables is, it is puzzling when political parties expect people to believe periodic spikes are on account of hoarders. When compared to grains such as rice, these vegetables do not have a long shelf life. Theres a slim chance of each bout of price spikes being driven by just hoarders.If anything, food ministrys data shows India does not have a uniform nationwide trend when it comes to onions and potatoes.Over three months ended 24 June 2014, price variations of onions and potatoes differed sharply across four metros. If onion prices increased 14% in Delhi, the rise was 50% in Kolkata. In both Mumbai and Chennai, the increase was 33%. There no discernible pattern here that would suggest a shadowy network of hoarders holding the country to ransom.The story was the same in the case of potatoes. The rise in price over three months in Delhi was 15%, while it was 68% in Chennai and 42% in Kolkata. The price trend in all probability is influenced by a set of local factors.If there is one common factor across India, it is that there is not enough competition in the food supply chain. Ram Vilas Paswan, consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister, and Arun Jaitley, finance minister, who are to meet with states representatives on Friday should focus on reforms in the food supply chain.Hopefully, they will stop using an onion hoarder as a bogeyman. The fight against food inflation isnt won by deflecting attention towards a bogeyman."

In Delhi, the retail price on Monday was between Rs. 25 and Rs. 30 a kg as against the wholesale price of around Rs. 18 a kg. Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Delhi have sought the Centres permission to impose stock control orders on onion traders but the government is yet to decide.The Centre has also convened a meeting with State Food and Consumer Affairs Ministers here on July 4 when the issue will be discussed, sources said.Some other steps to curb inflation include marginal increase in the minimum support price for crops, as last year. The step is expected to reduce the price distortion between market and government-determined prices. The government also announced export restrictions on onions and potatoes last week."

This can be explained only by leading the people to believe that they have moved from the Congress to the BJP today! It is time to remind these pundits that the earlier BJP-led NDA Vajpayee governments electoral slogans of India shining and feel good factor were rejected by the people, keeping them away from government for a decade.The moot argument of the pundits is that this Modi government must undertake reforms that will lead to greater availability of resources at cheaper rates of interest to the corporates. This will stimulate larger investments, leading to higher growth and employment generation. If this is done, lo and behold, India will become the El Dorado  land of flowing milk and honey. Such resources can be found by drastically cutting the UPAs vote-bank policies of populism, ie, reduce, if not eliminate, subsidies for the poor, restrict and cut back on expenditures on food security and other entitlements for the poor. The Food Security Act came into force on July 5, 2013. The state governments were to implement the law by July 4, 2014. The Modi government has already decided to extend this deadline by three months.In yet another absurdity, these pundits have claimed that within one month of the Modi government, prices have fallen. Potatoes selling at Rs 100 a kilo under the UPA government are now selling at Rs 30. Every household is, thus, saving `70/kg on potatoes alone! Hence why further subsidies? They seem to be living in some other Indian Wonderland. The official data indicates that the inflation rate has suddenly shown an upward swing. The wholesale price index rose from 5.2% in April to 6.01% in May 2014. Consumer price index growth would naturally be a multiple of this price rise. Worse, this surge in the inflation rate is based on the rise in food prices and essential commodities. The food inflation rate rose to 9.5% in May against 8.64% in April. Potato inflation was highest at 31.4% followed by fruits at 19.4% and eggs, meat and fish at 12.47%. Manufactured products went up by 3.55%.Under these conditions, the prescription for drastically cutting subsidies only means that there is going to be a severe squeeze on the quantum of purchasing power that is available in the hands of the vast majority of our people. Now, no corporate would invest more when the people simply do not have the money to buy the products produced by such investment. This will neither generate profits nor lead to higher growth or employment. Thus, making available a larger quantum of resources at cheaper costs to the corporates can only mean making resources available for speculation and not production. This is what explains the current stock market boom when the economy is stagnating and manufacturing output declining. The fact that the capital goods sectors output declined in 2013-14 compared to the previous year suggests corporate investment that should have got a boost from the stock market boom has actually declined.On the other hand, the surge in the prices of gold, real estate and savings in foreign currency, leading to a decline in the value of the rupee, clearly show that profits are being maximised through speculative activity rather than production. Hence, the prescription for making resources available at cheaper costs will only lead to profit maximisation through speculation and not to higher growth and employment. In the bargain, the miseries of the vast majority of the people are bound to exponentially increase.Completely ignoring this reality, these pundits are renewing the demand for the elimination of subsidies on petroleum products. This, we are told, is necessary to improve the health of the economy as the oil companies are losing thousands of crores of rupees of under recoveries. These under-recoveries are not actual losses, they are the difference between the international price of a petroleum product and its domestic price. If India were to eliminate all subsidies and price these petroleum products at international levels, then these under-recoveries can be wiped out. Now, India essentially imports crude oil, which is refined to produce different products like petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG. Any loss or gain, therefore, must be calculated on the basis of the cost of production domestically (including the cost of imported crude). The fact that the annual balance sheets of all major oil companies show handsome profits means that there is simply no loss. Therefore, the alarming cries of staggering under-recoveries are a ruse to make petroleum products unaffordable to the vast mass of the people while permitting India Inc to reap super profits. This is a gigantic fraud. By endorsing such a fraud, the Modi government will only perpetuate mounting peoples agonies.This budget season, therefore, is not of mere routine concern. The Modi government appears to send signals that it shall implement the UPA policy trajectory of widening the divide between the two Indias more aggressively.The Prime Minister has agonised in a blog (typical one-way communication) that he did not have the luxury of a 100-day honeymoon period which other new governments enjoyed.

It also increased the minimum export price of the two vegetables to $500 per tonne to check their outbound movement. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to bring onions and potatoes under the purview of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 for one year.The step imposed an upper limit on the stocks of the two vegetables held by traders and farmers. It also empowers the state governments to undertake de-hoarding operations and control the price of onions and potatoes.The measure was taken after tough action by the government for nearly two weeks failed to check rising prices of the two vegetables.Despite adequate availability, there has been an increase in prices of onions and potatoes. There have been complaints of hoarding, Law and Telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said after a meeting of the CCEA.We want to assure all citizens that our government is committed to reduce prices he said, adding a notification to bring onions and potatoes under ECA will be issued on Thursday. New Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Mizoram and Tripura had requested the Centre for such a measure so as to differentiate between a trader and a stockist before taking any action against hoarding.The decision on the stock holding limit will, however, be left to each state government to notify, Prasad said.Onions and potatoes were removed from the purview of the ECA in 2004 after remaining under its ambit for years.Earlier in the day, the government increased the Minimum Export Price (MEP) for onions to $500 per tonne from earlier $300 per tonne. MEP is the rate below which no exports are allowed.Only a fortnight ago, the MEP on onions was re-introduced at $300 per tonne. Retail prices of onion have risen to about Rs 25-30 a kg, while the wholesale prices are ruling at Rs 18.50 a kg in the national capital.The CCEA also decided to release 5 million tonnes of additional rice to BPL and APL families through public distribution system in states where the food security law is not in force. The additional rice, which will be over and above the normal PDS allocation, will be released from July to March 2015.We have sufficient supply. There is no need to panic. We are taking all possible measures to improve supply and control prices,"" Prasad said, adding that the government was hopeful that the monsoon rain would improve from next week.* Encourages equitable distribution and availability at fair price of the scarce item listed under the Act* Checks unethical trade practices like hoarding and black marketing* Empowers government to control production, supply and distribution of commodities under the Act* States can facilitate distribution of commodities and fix their prices but are under centres supervision* Commodities such as foodgrain, edible oils, pulses, kerosene, sugar are essential commodities"
114,AGP slams Modi on price hike ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140702/jsp/northeast/story_18571172.jsp,2014-07-02,Telegraph,"Guwahati, July 1: The AGP today flayed the Narendra Modi government for hiking petrol and diesel prices. AGP working president Atul Bora told reporters here that the latest hike in fuel prices had come as a disappointment to people who voted for the BJP expecting a change from the anti-people policies of the previous Congress-led UPA government. The rise in prices of petrol and diesel and soaring prices of food items have let down the people who harboured expectations from the new government which made tall promises before the elections, Bora said. People had voted out the Congress-led coalition government for its failure to control price rise and handed a grand victory to the BJP with hopes that it would give them some respite. But the first 35 days of the Modi government turned out to be sheer disappointment, he said. Boras remarks came as a reaction to hike in petrol price by a steep Rs 1.69 a litre and diesel by 50 paise a litre. Not only fuel price hike, there has been a 14 per cent increase in train fares and the prices of onions, potatoes and sugar, among others, are skyrocketing. It appears that the Modi government will break the record of the UPA government in terms of price rise. The AGP leader also deplored the Modi government for its double speak on influx from Bangladesh. During election campaigns in Assam and elsewhere, Modi had said illegal migrants would be sent packing after May 16. However, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj did not even raise the issue during her recent visit to Bangladesh, Bora said. Instead of taking any step for detection and deportation of illegal migrants from the state, the Modi government is now going to issue a five-year multiple-entry visa to Bangladeshi citizens over 65 and under 13 years of age. The visa relaxation will only complicate the problem of illegal migration. In 2012-13, 4.83 lakh Bangladeshi nationals who came with regular visas either went missing or have overstayed in the country, he said."
115,Prices move upwards,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140702/jsp/odisha/story_18572860.jsp,2014-07-02,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, July 1: The rising prices of potato and onion have set the kitchen on fire, and the state government has stepped in to do some fire-fighting. As a first step, the state government today warned traders of stern action if they fail to follow government guidelines on prices. While onion prices have gone up for the second time in a fortnight, rising upto Rs 30 per kg now, potato, which was selling for Rs 18 a kilo till a couple of days ago, sold for Rs 20 today. With a crisis looming, the civil supplies and consumer welfare department today asked traders to maintain a maximum gap of Rs 2.50 to Rs 3 between retail and wholesale price of potato and in case of onion it should be Rs 3 to Rs 4. It has warned hoarders of stern action. Hoarders will not be spared and we are making it clear that no one can sell onion and potato at a price higher than that stipulated by us, civil supplies and consumer welfare secretary Madhusudan Padhee told reporters following a stocktaking meeting convened by his minister Sanjay Das Burma. This is the second time onion prices have gone up in the last two weeks. Last time, onion prices had risen from Rs 18 to Rs 24. Comparatively potato prices have not varied much, but this hike of Rs 2 pinches because you cant avoid eating it, said Rina Das, a homemaker. Onion prices have shot up because the local crop is not reaching the market and the supply from Nasik, country's main onion growing, has shrunk following crop loss. According to our information, there was a crop loss of nearly 20 per cent in Nasik, which is our main supplier. We are also getting a lot of rotten onions in each consignment. Around three to five kilograms of the produce have to be discarded in each bag of 50 kg, said general secretary of Unit I Daily Market Gayadhar Swain. State horticulture director Sanjeev Chadha told The Telegraph that Odisha's requirement of onion is around 4.32 lakh metric tonnes (MT) per year. This can be taken care of from the local produce, but the lack of storage facility is a major problem. Since we do not have enough storing facility for this crop, the farmers sell bulk of their produce to traders from neighbouring Chhattisgarh and Bengal, said Chadha. Onion prices have been fluctuating every year. While it sold for 16 a kilo in 2011, the rate varied between Rs 18 and Rs 20 a year later. However, the prices soared to an unprecedented Rs 60 a kg last year following floods in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said that the government had taken no steps to set up a regional mandi for onions in Bhubaneswar that caters to the needs of around 14 lakh people from city and its nearby areas. With the supply from Maharashtra turning into a trickle this year, there is a growing apprehension that onion price might rise further creating a 2013-like situation. The horticulture directorate has set up a 500MT capacity storage house for onion at Titlagarh in collaboration with Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. We are planning to set up similar facilities at Nuapara, Kalahandi and Balangir, respectively. In order to educate farmers on onion cultivation and its storage techniques, we have requested the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation to start a centre at Boudh soon, Chadha said. As far as potato is concerned, the Odisha Economic Survey 2013-14 says that the state produces nearly 1 lakh MT of potato against a demand of 9-10 lakh MT per year. Consequently, the state has to depend on the supply of the produce from Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh."

Over the weeks, the prices of vegetables in the biggest veggie market here at Chhatrabazar have gone beyond the reach of common people. Barring the prices of potatoes and onions, which have registered marginal increases due to government control, the prices of other green vegetables have increased nearly three times during the past one week.The green vegetables come from local areas and due to the rains and end of summer season, the availability of seasonal vegetables has been affected. But once the vegetables grown during rainy season hit the markets, normalcy would return, said a vegetable vendor in Chhatrabazar.However, the towering prices of vegetables have hit the poor and downtrodden, including the daily-wage earners the most. The daily essential vegetables for us like potato and onion are vanishing from our kitchens, said a construction worker at Markat Nagar. Potato is selling at Rs.18 to Rs. 20 per kg and onion is priced at Rs. 28 to Rs. 30 per kg in Chhatrabazar and the same are priced a little higher in sub-urban and other local markets. All the green vegetables are selling at exorbitant prices between Rs. 40 to Rs. 120 per kg, mainly due to short supply. There is no question of hoarding the green vegetables aiming to book profit at a later stage because they are perishable, said Kuna Patra, a vegetable grower.The district supply department officials are on their toes to ensure that the potato and onion prices do not shoot up due to hoarding by unscrupulous traders. At least four district-level teams are keeping a watch over the market and the retailers are asked to fix rate charts in their kiosks showing at what price they have purchased potato and onion from wholesale markets."

This cyclical price rise can be avoided if we can create 15-20 godowns, Paswan said at a seminar."

The decision of the cabinet committee on economic affairs to curb hoarding by traders, through the mechanism of imposing restrictions on holding of onions and potato stocks through bringing them under the purview of the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) of 1955 may sound menacing. It may conjure up images of hoarders being frog-marched to police stations and shoved behind bars  and voila, prices will magically come down. But unfortunately, these are just delusions.Bringing potatoes and onions under the purview of the ECA is no big deal as states, which have to implement ECA, have shown no interest in using the law despite the surge in prices of essential commodities in recent years.States are not in favour of using strong arm tactics like arrests by using the ECA since the raids are usually futile with very few prosecutions and hardly any convictions. Numbers for recent years show that the total number of raids conducted against hoarders by states under the ECA has steadily come down from 2 lakh in 2010 to 1.4 lakh in 2013. And the number of arrests under the act has fallen by almost half from around 10,000 to 5,718.Most of the raids failed to discover any hoarded stocks. The numbers show that prosecution was possible only in very few cases. For example, out of the 2 lakh raids made in 2010 prosecution was possible only in 4539 cases. And by 2013 the number of prosecutions came down to just 2725. These numbers are too meagre to have any significant impact on improving supply of goods.Claims now being made that states like West Bengal, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram and Tripura are now clamouring for inclusion of potatoes and onions under the purview of the ECA are hard to comprehend, given that those states have almost shunned using the act against hoarders in any meaningful way for years now.So rather than using an unpopular law that has been shunned by most states, the central government would be better off by focusing on steps to improve production of food items like onions and potatoes and increase market competition by breaking the oligopoly of a few traders. This can be done by allowing more players to trade in markets. For this the government should first ensure that all states are persuaded to bring fruits and vegetables out from the purview of the Agriculture Produce Marketing (APMC) Act  to allow farmers to sell their produce to any buyer  and not restrict itself to making just token threats against traders."

Many other locally significant grain and vegetable crops have suffered the same fate.The trend is a warning that the growing reliance on a few food crops may also accelerate the worldwide rise in obesity, heart disease and diabetes which are strongly affected by dietary change and have become major health problems, ""even within countries still grappling with significant constraints in food availability"".""In East and Southeast Asia, several major foods  like wheat and potato  have gained importance alongside longstanding staples like rice,"" Khoury said. ""But this expansion of major staple foods has come at the expense of the many diverse minor foods that used to figure importantly in people's diets,"" he added.Another danger of a more homogeneous global food basket, scientists say, is that it makes agriculture more vulnerable to major threats like drought, insect pests and diseases.Luigi Guarino, study co-author said, ""As the global population rises and the pressure increases on our global food system so does our dependence on the global crops and production systems that feed us. The price of failure of any of these crops will become very high."""

File picture Shillong, July 2: Citizens are disappointed with the BJP-led NDA government as they swallow the bitter pill called food inflation. We expected that with the BJP taking charge of the government, there would be relief. But things have not chan-ged. Our household budget exceeds by Rs 1,000 every mo-nth, said Kalkal Momin, a re-sident of Upper Chandmari in Tura in West Garo hills, said. Echoing Momin, Silje B. Sangma, a resident of Bonepa locality in Tura, said, The cost of living is escalating every day. It has become difficult for me to manage. In neighbouring Assam villages, the price varies. There is no regulation of price in Tura. These are only a few of the complaints expressed by citizens who have to meet ends with limited means. The sentiments expressed could be similar across the country. However, authorities are on their toes to ensure that no hoarding, black marketing and creation of artificial scarcity of essential food items take place. In Shillong, the East Khasi Hills deputy commissioner approves rates of ess ential commodities, and no one can sell beyond the prescribed rate. The district also has the price monitoring committee for essential commodities, which regularly puts a check on the essential food items. However, to pre-empt any artificial scarcity by vested interest groups, deputy commissioner Sanjay Goyal said random checks would be conducted in the markets. Till date, no complaint of hoarding has reached the office of the deputy commissioner, he said. At the same time, he said Meghalaya largely depends on imports from other states, as there is little production here. West Garo Hills deputy commissioner Pravin Bakshi said until date, there has been no complaint of hoarding in the district while claiming that regular checks are being conducted in the markets. It may be mentioned that the Centre had asked all the state governments to crack down on hoarders. The department of consumer affairs, under the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, has stated that seasonality plays a major impact on prices of vegetables. However, the abnormal price rise witnessed last year was mainly because of lower production along with hoarding. Even though the production of onion as well as potato was higher during 2013-14 compared to 2012-13, the reason for the current price rise in these commodities may be because of manipulation of market forces, the department has said in a note, which has been put on its website. Secretary to the Frontier Chamber of Commerce, S.K. Tarad, said, There is no hoarding or black marketing of essential commodities in Meghalaya. There is a sufficient quantity of essential items. According to him, in Shillong, the wholesale price of onion is in the range of Rs 25 and Rs 35 while the retail price is in between Rs 35 and Rs 45. The wholesale price of potato is Rs 18 while the retail price is in the range of Rs 22 and Rs 23. The deputy commissioner fixes the prices of essential commodities after every 15 days, he added. Tarad also said materials to Shillong are being sent from Guwahati, and hence, the prices will depend on the Guwahati market scenario. In Tura, the price of onion is Rs 40 per kg while potato (new) and potato (old) is Rs 40 and Rs 30 per kg, respectively. However, these prices vary in other places. According to government data, food inflation based on consumer price index (CPI) has shown a rise of 9.40 per cent for the month of May 2014 as against 10.71 per cent a year ago. The rate of inflation showed a marginal decline compared to the previous year, but it is still very high, the data said. The Centre has convened a conference of state ministers of consumer affairs on increase in food prices in New Delhi on Friday."
124,Vital tag on veggie duo,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140703/jsp/business/story_18576179.jsp,2014-07-03,Telegraph,"New Delhi, July 2: The government today decided to bring onions and potatoes under the essential commodities act to prevent hoarding and curb price rise. States can impose stock holding limits on food wholesalers once the two staple vegetables come under the act. This will empower the state governments to undertake de-hoarding operations and to control the prices of onions and potatoes. It will help in the efforts being taken to tackle the problem of rising prices and also improve availability, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs. He said, We think there are enough potatoes and onions in the country and theres no need to panic. The state governments will fix stock holding limits according to local conditions and the limit will remain for a year, he said. Earlier in the day, the government had raised the export prices of onions by 67 per cent to $500 per tonne to augment domestic supply and curb a price rise. Limits are currently imposed till September on pulses, edible oils and oilseeds; and till November on rice and paddy. Finance minister Arun Jaitley yesterday said high inflation was one of the major challenges facing the government ahead of the budget next week. The wholesale price-based inflation rose to a five-month high of 6.01 per cent in May against 5.20 per cent in the previous month because of a sharp jump in food and fuel prices. Retail inflation, measured in terms of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was recorded at 8.28 per cent in May, according to latest government data. Food price inflation is near double-digits, with a late monsoon pushing up the cost of vegetables and dairy products. Despite sufficient supply of onions and potatoes in the country, their prices have been rising in the past few days in apprehension of a below-normal monsoon. In the national capital, the retail price of onion is in the range of Rs 25-30 per kg and the wholesale price is Rs 18.50 per kg. Similarly, the retail rate of potato is Rs 27 per kg and wholesale price is Rs 16.75 per kg. Onion production is estimated to have risen to 192 lakh tonnes during the 2013-14 crop year (July-June), from 168 lakh tonnes in 2012-13. Onion is usually cultivated four times in a year  early kharif, kharif, early rabi and rabi. Meanwhile, the CCEA has approved an additional allocation of 50 lakh tonnes of rice for distribution to below poverty line (BPL) families for the period July-2014 to March-2015 or till implementation of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) by the respective state or union territory, whichever is earlier. This will protect people affected by price rise, particularly in those areas where the food security act has not been implemented. States/Union territories have been asking for more foodgrain to meet their requirements for the public distribution system."

However, retailers are selling them at Rs 28-30 and Rs 20-22 per kg, respectively, in local markets.The wholesale traders conduct their trade through KUBS. Entire business at KUBS is recorded and monitored and contrary to popular belief, there is no scope for hoarding, said Bharat Vasani, vice-president (trade and commerce) SCCI.He added that the retailers, on the other hand, were unorganised and were increasing prices of essential commodities at will. We are apprehensive that the administration may later target the wholesalers for alleged hoarding, said Vasani.The agitators also claimed that there had been no demand-supply gap as far as onions and potatoes are concerned. The city normally receives 200 tonnes of onions and 500 tonnes of potatoes daily. And there has been no decrease in the supply till now, said the SCCI president."

127,Hoarders disrupting supply; Govt to take action: FM,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/417662/hoarders-disrupting-supply-govt-take.html,2014-07-04,Deccan Herald,"New Delhi, Jul 4, 2014, PTI: 16:44 ISTBlaming hoarders for recent spurt in food prices, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said there was no need for panic as country has enough food stocks and promised stern action against black marketeers.Eager to control prices before they spiral out of hand, the Centre today called a meeting of State food ministers to discuss steps to crack down on hoarding and improving availability in the market.The Centre, which has in past few days imposed minimum export price on staple kitchen items like onions and potatoes and put stock holding limits on these, today indicated it was willing to consider suggestions for making hoarding of essential commodities a non-bailable offence.""One thing is clear that there is no panic situation. Whatever feedback we have got from state ministers is that there is no need for panic,"" Jaitley said after the meeting.Stating that prices of vegetables and pulses generally rise in July, he said this time there is an abnormal increase in prices of 2-3 commodities but ""there is no panic situation.""Allaying fears of the impact of a delayed monsoon on prices, he said ""monsoon has just started, it is a late start and it is too early to create any panic"".To deal with the price situation, Jaitley said some states have suggested strengthening of the Essential Commodities Act and making hoarding a non-bailable offence.The government and the Consumer Affairs Ministry will take a view on the suggestions of making hoarding a non-bailable offence, he added.Food inflation rose to 9.5 per cent in May, while the WPI inflation was at a five-month high of 6.01 per cent.Referring to onion and potato prices, Jaitley said ""there has been a record output and there is no shortage of these items""""Therefore it is not an issue of scarcity but it is an issue of supply side. These commodities are available in sufficient amount but the normal supply is disrupted by hoarders anticipating higher prices,"" the Minister added.However, he said: ""We have sufficient food grains stock with the government of India to face to any kind of situation. Depending on where the shortfall or deficient areas are....if such a situation arise, we are equipped to deal.""In order to rein in prices, Jaitely said most of the state ministers suggested that the Centre should help them in augmenting storage facility.""Some states suggested a price stabilisation fund. In case if prices in certain commodities go up, there could be market intervention,"" he said.The meeting was also attended by Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh.Noting that the current price rise is a temporary phenomena created by hoarders, Paswan asked the state governments to enforce the Essential Commodities Act effectively.Earlier addressing the meeting, Jaitley said: ""There are reports of below normal monsoon this year. Hoarders are taking advantage of the situation.""""When production of food items is higher than last year and still prices rise, then it means that intermediaries are keeping the stock somewhere,"" he added.He said the test of good governance is how to de-hoard the stock kept by intermediaries into the market to rein in prices. ""This is the biggest challenge.""""Prices of some items had touched Rs 70-100 per kg last year. Prices are still lower this year. There is no panic situation,"" he said.The Finance Minister asked the state governments to assess the problem as action taken after price rise creates panic in the market.""There should be collaborative efforts from both Centre and states so that price situation does not go out of control,"" Jaitley said, adding, ""states are equally anxious and they do not want prices to rise.""In order to check prices during the coming festival season, Jaitley urged the states to assess the supply-demand situation and take effective measures in advance to boost supply.The Finance Minister highlighted measures taken by the Centre in the last few weeks including additional allocation of 5 million tonnes of rice for poor and imposition of minimum export price on onion and potato.Noting that prices of crude oil have increased due to tension in Iraq, Jaitley said there are, however, indications of softening of prices."

129,Rajnath homes in on onions,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140704/jsp/nation/story_18580272.jsp,2014-07-04,Telegraph,"New Delhi, July 3: Rajnath Singhs first news conference as Union home minister today focused on potato and onion prices in Delhi, not guns and grenades. One hot topic was raids on suspected hoarders, not terror modules. As many as 540 premises had been raided on Tuesday alone and 1,082 in the past one month, a proud home minister said. A television journalist couldnt help asking: Did you have to hold this press conference because it (vegetable prices) may impact internal security? Rajnath could only laugh in answer. That the government would be keen to fight price rise amid the rising resentment is no surprise. But the media invite saying the subject of the home ministers first media interaction was to be onion and potato prices in the capital did astonish many. The briefing was held in the conference hall at North Block, a venue for internal security meetings, signing of peace pacts with militants, and treaties with foreign governments. But Rajnath seemed short on talking points even the day before Prime Minister Narendra Modis Kashmir visit. And even at a time several governors have quit and successors must be found for them. Its a shortage that had kept him from any media interaction since being sworn in 38 days ago. With Modi apparently keeping the reins of governance firmly in hand, most ministers have been shying away from the media anyway. That the big decisions will be taken in the Prime Ministers Office is apparent. Modi will meet chief ministers sometime in August to discuss internal security and Centre-state relations, sources told The Telegraph. Sources said the expected consultation with the home ministry on Modis Valley trip had not taken place. Rajnath is yet to visit any of the major theatres of internal strife although his junior, Kiren Rijiju, will travel to Arunachal Pradesh tomorrow to review border management programmes. The home minister wasnt ready to talk about prices countrywide, either, but only in Delhi on the plea that it is a Union territory and is under central rule. Union territories administration is under my purview, so I shall speak only about them, he said. Administration of Union territories is one of the ministrys 20 divisions, along with those for internal security, police modernisation, border management, Left-wing extremism and the like. Yesterday, the government had brought onions and potatoes under the Essential Commodities Act. There should be no hoarding and where necessary, there should be raids, Rajnath said. He added that the number of government-recognised outlets selling onions and potatoes would be increased. An action plan for the period between July 15 and September 15 would be prepared to control prices. Rajnath said he had met Delhi lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung over the spiralling prices of essentials while home secretary Anil Goswami had spoken to top agriculture ministry officials. Well try to strike a balance between demand and supply, he said. Rajnath did answer a few questions relating to his ministrys other mandates, though. The answers were brief and delivered after consulting Goswami who sat on his left. He confirmed that officials from the Registrar General of India, which functions under the home ministry, and the Unique Identification Authority of India met today to sort out their respective duties. Telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad attended the meeting. Asked about the Z-plus security for BJP general secretary Amit Shah, Rajnath said security matters depended on inputs from the Intelligence Bureau."

PichumaniJust as Chennai residents have adjusted their household budgets to accommodate the recent fuel price hike, they now have further worry in the form of soaring vegetable prices.The price of onions has nearly doubled over the past fortnight and is now between Rs. 36 and Rs. 40 in retail markets.Shanthi Subramanian, a resident of Nolambur, said shopkeepers have removed the price tags of a few vegetables like beans (Rs. 90/kg) and broad beans (Rs. 60/kg). I hosted lunch for eight persons a few days ago. I spent Rs. 875 on vegetables aone. Even a bunch of coriander leaves is priced at Rs. 22, she said.Traders at the Koyambedu wholesale market said the soaring heat and lack of rains have led to poor yield. On Thursday, Chennai experienced a maximum temperature of 39.2 degrees Celsius, three degrees more than the normal temperature. Delay in the onset of sea breeze resulted in a hot July day.Of late, Koyambedu market has been getting 300 lorry loads of produce daily, about 100 truck loads less than usual.Hailstorm that hit Maharashtra  from where Chennai receives a major share of produce  a few months ago, damaged onion crops.For the past few days, onion prices have been steadily rising in the wholesale market. On Thursday, the wholesale price of onions stood at Rs. 30/kg.However, traders said there is no hoarding in the market and there is not much difference between wholesale and retail prices.In the retail market, the prices of green chilli and potato have jumped to Rs. 45/kg and Rs. 34/kg, respectively, an increase of Rs. 10 from more than a fortnight ago. Cauliflowers, carrots, brinjals and drumsticks are also expensive.S. Chandran, a wholesale trader, said the prices have gone up by a minimum of 10 per cent due to fewer arrivals from other States. The recent hike in fuel prices has also added to escalating costs. The same trend will continue for a month until the rains resume."

Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, told The Hindu on Friday that the wholesale price of big onion in Coimbatore was Rs. 27 a kg for the best quality. The average price ranged between Rs. 22 and Rs. 27 a kg.However, the prices are relatively low in Coimbatore compared to other cities.Coimbatore is getting its supply now from Maharashtra. For the next four months, supply from Maharashtra will be what the farmers and traders have in stock. However, the price quoted at the markets in Maharasthra now is Rs. 26 a kg and the transport cost is almost Rs. 4 a kg. So the traders here are selling at a lower price.There are about 25 wholesale traders in Coimbatore for onion and prices are relatively low because of competition.Supply from the farms in Tamil Nadu will start by the end of this month and from Karnataka by next month. Yet, prices of big onion are expected to go up in the coming days, he says.Though the prices of small onion are very less now, prices of potato are going up.The wholesale price for small onion is Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 a kg. For potato, it is Rs. 22 to Rs. 25 a kg and it is expected to go up further.Mr. Rajendran says that though south west monsoon has set in, rainfall was very less last month and this is expected to affect almost all the crops.Jegan S. Damodarasamy, executive director of Sree Annapoorna Hotel, says labour costs have almost tripled in the last three years. Now, with vegetables prices also shooting up, hotels are affected.For instance, the price of coriander has shot up to Rs. 100 a kg. Some food items such as coriander chutney or garnishing are common and with prices going up hotels have no choice but to relook at purchase of some of these items. We are looking at measures to manage the costs, he says.Photo caption: Prices of onion and potato have shot up in the last few weeks."

At a meeting between senior central ministers and state food ministers here today, the government also promised to give more teeth to the essential commodities act by making hoarding a non-bailable offence. Finance minister Arun Jaitley, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan and agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh were at the meeting. The Centre also decided to consider setting up a price stablisation fund, which will be used to help state governments buy commodities and sell at subsidised rates. The government will have at least one storage facility in each of the 635 districts of the country. Besides, states have been asked to exempt perishable commodities from local taxes and fees till they are delisted from the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Act. It has also been decided to free inter-state movement of onion. Todays meeting was called to work out the strategy to tackle rising prices and build buffer stocks against a possible monsoon failure. Though Jaitley warned against panic, almost all state food ministers recommended building more storage facilities to guard against poor rainfall. During July-December every year, prices of some food items increase because of hoarding, Jaitley said here today. The problem, he argued, had been aggravated because of the below-normal monsoon forecasts. Skynet, a privately held weather forecasting service, added to Indias worries by predicting a 60 per cent chance of a below-normal monsoon. Hoarders are taking advantage of the forecast of below-normal monsoon. State governments should take stern action against hoarders to rein in prices. The Centre will give complete support, Jaitley said. However, the minister argued that this year had been better than last year on the price front. Prices of some items had touched Rs 70-100 per kg last year. Prices are still lower this year. There is no panic situation, he said. The price of many food items such as onion, potato and pulses have gone up between 15 per cent and 70 per cent in the last three months."

Waterlogging in fields has caused rotting of root vegetables. Leafy vegetables have been affected by bacterial diseases, said vegetable vendor Raju.He said there had been a considerable increase in the cost of vegetables in general, but for good quality vegetable one has to shell out 50% more. Most of the vendors have only low quality vegetables because there are very few people who want to pay more.A housewife, Saraswati, said vegetables have become expensive and poor in quality, so one has to take whatever is available.Situation in the wholesale market is no better. If after picking and choosing vegetables, vendors buy poor quality stock, wholesellers refuse to take it back. Humidity following rains has caused vegetables packed in sacks to rot by the time they reach the market. The retailers have to accept whatever is available, said another vegetable vendor, Kamal Ahmad.As for the prices, sharpest rise has been in the case of peas selling at Rs 30 per kg against Rs 20 per kg a few weeks ago. Potatoes selling at Rs 16 per kg a month ago now cost Rs 20 per kg. The price of onions has also increased from Rs 16 per kg to Rs 20 per kg. Vendors feel cost of potato may go up further as standing crops are prone to rotting in waterlogged fields. Cost of carrots has gone up from Rs 15 per kg to Rs 24 per kg and of cauliflower from Rs10 to Rs15 apiece. Cost of brinjal has also gone up from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 40 per kg.

The Delhi government has received an in-principle approval from the Centre to make hoarding of vegetables a non-bailable offence.The Delhi government had asked the Centre to make offences under the Essential Commodities Act non-bailable in order to crack down on hoarders and people who divert food grains and use domestic LPG cylinders for commercial purposes more effectively, sources said.HT had on Friday reported that hoarding may soon be made a non-bailable offence.The move, officials believed, would act as a deterrent. Offenders are currently able to procure bail easily.Those who divert food grains, misuse domestic LPG cylinders and hoard onions and potatoes to sell them at a higher price later will be targeted.The Lieutenant Governor had raised this issue. The Centre has agreed to amend the Essential Commodities Act under which any offence of hoarding will become non-bailable and attract stricter punishment too, said a senior Delhi government official.The Centre had on Wednesday taken the extreme step of bringing onions and potatoes under the Essential Commodities Act, 1995, which allows states to impose stock holding limits on the vegetables.The decision was taken by the Centre that feared hoarding had played a major role jacking up the prices.After the Centres decision, the Delhi government also decided to fix stock limits to crack down on hoarders.We will soon impose a stock limit on onions and potatoes for wholesalers as well as retailers, said a senior Delhi government official.To keep prices in check, onions and potatoes are being sold at more than 200 locations through government mobile vans at Rs 20 per kg and Rs 18 per kg.

Trinamool Congress leader Kalyan Banerjee was among the opposition leaders who flagged the issue of price rise during the meeting and wanted it to be discussed first after the presentation of the rail and general budgets.The Centre, too, is finding hard to curb inflation though it has initiated measures like putting onion and potato in essential commodities list to control rising prices.After the meeting, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu and Speaker Sumitra Mahajan separately said that the government was ready to allow discussion on all issues.

They are ready to discuss every issue. Different suggestions have come and they will be decided after the meeting of the Business Advisory Committee, Mahajan said while pointing out that the meeting was cordial and everyone promised cooperation.The session will see External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj making a statement in both the Houses on Indians held up in Iraq, including the safe return of nurses to the country, besides presentation of railway and general budgets as well as a budget for Delhi, which is under the Presidents rule.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP patriarch L K Advani joined the leaders during the lunch.

Telegraph picture New Delhi, July 4: The Centre will make hoarding a non-bailable offence, set a price stabilisation fund and fix a cap on the quantity of essential commodities that can be stocked. The decision comes a day after Bihar rejected the Centres plea to cap the quantity of essential commodities like onions and potatoes that can be stocked. Its plea was that it was for the Centre to come up with such a law. The Centre has now decided to work closely with states in this regard. State food and consumer protection minister Shyam Rajak told The Telegraph over phone from New Delhi: All food ministers today sat with Union minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan in New Delhi and discussed ways by which prices of essential commodities can be controlled. Bihar put forth its point and the Centre agreed to our point. It has been decided that the Essential Commodities Act will be strengthened and made stringent. Also, the Centre has said they will fix the cap on stocking of essential commodities. Thus, state governments will not be involved in fixing the stock limit. There was a consensus that the Essential Commodities Act should be strengthened and more teeth provided to it. Offences under the law should be made non-bailable, Paswan said after the meeting. He said a proposal to make necessary amendments in the Essential Commodities Act would be moved for the Cabinets consideration in a week. He did not indicate the size of the fund being created or the timeframe within which it will be set up. Union finance minister Arun Jaitley stressed there was no panic situation. Hoarders were disrupting normal supply anticipating high prices, he said. We have sufficient foodgrain with the Government of India to face to any kind of situation. Depending on where the shortfall or deficient areas are... if such a situation arises, we are equipped to deal with it, he said. Stating that food prices rise during monsoon months of July-September, Paswan said it was decided that at least one storage space would be created in all 635 districts. Rajak confirmed the Centre has decided to help state governments in construction of cold storages and normal storages in every district. The issue of absence of proper storage in many districts was raised and the Centre agreed it needed to the addressed. The Centre will come up with storages of different kinds in every district of states. And again, the state government will help the Centre in this connection. It has also been decided that the Centre will create a price control fund in association with state governments. Details of how the fund will function will be discussed. However, it will be exclusively for controlling prices of commodities, Rajak said. Earlier, there was a division of opinion among economists on the Centres decision. While some said the Centre should decide on the quantity that can be stocked, others felt the state government was in a better position to do the same. The consumers said there was need for transparency. The state government should provide the right information to the Centre and the Centre too should check and re-check facts and figures being given by the Centre before implementing the stock limits. If this is not done, things will never improve, Kankerbagh resident Surendra Kumar said."
139,TIME FOR FOODBALL,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140705/jsp/odisha/story_18583441.jsp,2014-07-05,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar/Cuttack, July 4: From the pitch to the platter, World Cup has hit a feverish high with the appetite of the gourmets skyrocketing for both delicacies and football. Following the trend of Bhubaneswar, Cuttack too has joined the gastronomic revelry. With the Fifa World Cup fever already reaching its zenith in Brazil, a rich variety of dishes named after various football players are driving the soccer fans in Cuttack crazy. Golden Spoon, one of the best restaurants in the city, has now turned host for the soccer fans by offering them special screening of the World Cup matches along with a wide range of delicacies. One can go for the Messis corner (steamed chicken roll with sweet and spicy kung pao sauce), Ronaldos favourite (chicken chunks marinated in sour cream), Van Persies penalty (grilled king prawns), Neymars dribbling (stuffed potato with cottage cheese) or the Thomas header (boneless fish chunks marinated in garlic, sour cream and grilled). We have come up with a food fiesta and designed a special menu to catch up with the soccer mania and provide a rainbow of packages for the fans, especially with the World Cup quarter-finals already on. This will continue at our restaurant till the final game on July 13, said Pravas Pani, CEO of Golden Spoon. He added that the food festival had been organised for foodies to celebrate the greatest show on Earth. The fans can enjoy the matches on a big screen, while they will be provided with mughlai, tandoor and continental food items named after the footballers. We are offering nearly 15 special dishes for the guests this football season. The fans can enjoy the dishes at costs ranging from Rs 180 to Rs 450, said executive chef Rajesh Das, adding that the entire restaurant had been decorated with flags of various countries participating in the World Cup. Watching the matches is certainly difficult for us as they are screened late night and we usually see the recorded matches the next day. We are now able to see our favourite matches, while enjoying some mouth-watering dishes at the restaurant, said Abdul Wahid, a visitor. The Telegraph had earlier reported about Hotel Hindustan International and Mayfair in Bhubaneswar making similar arrangements. HHI has put up a huge board intimating its customers about the schedule of the tournament. They have named their sumptuous dishes after famous footballers. While the chicken tangri kebab here is called Neymar, the mutton gilafi kebab is called Messi. Now, that Italy and England are out of the tournament, people may not be particularly interested in Balotelli (pomfret dilnashi) and Rooney (bali prawn) too much. Likewise, at Mayfairs pub Cellar you can munch a Messi (mutton patties) or grab a Neymar (salad). While the HHI is offering a 10 per cent discount on drinks and snacks, Mayfair is giving a buy one, get one free on all cocktails and mocktails. Both the hotels have LCD televisions and projectors and have put up football nets to engage the foodies in some footwork. Foreigner guests watch the games more keenly than our Indian customers. Margaritas, tequilas, and sex on the beach are the most popular drinks right now, said Amaresh, a bartender at Cellar. In-house DJ Ravi belts out tracks such as Waka Waka, Ole Ola and Wavin Flag adding to the mood. The a-la carte snacks and drinks at both hotels will cost between Rs 250 and Rs 1,250 exclusive of taxes. It is lovely to know that many restaurants in the twin cities, especially Bhubaneswar, are celebrating the spirit of the World Cup with special food festivals. That time should not be far away when we actually boast of a sports bar or a pub that celebrates sports all round the yearShirshendu Roycricket commentator, Cuttack Its a great time for those who love both good food and football. Theres nothing better than digging into sumptuous dishes and watching terrific game play. It is like tikkas meet tiki-taka!Sabyasachi Sahoostudent, Bhubaneswar"

The commodity is available at Rs 30-40 per kg in retail markets, depending on the location. Mother Dairy's Safal outlets are selling onion at Rs 29 a kg.According to the latest daily report of the Department of Consumer Affairs on July 4, retail price of Rs 41 per kg in Port Blair was the highest in the country while the lowest was Rs 16 per kg in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. The average price was around Rs 28 per kg.According to the government's data, prices are on a higher side in eastern, southern and northern parts.Cities where prices were on higher side include Aizwal at Rs 40, Rs 34 in Kolkata, Rs 33 in Thiruvananthapuram and Rs 32 each in Kozhikode and Shillong. The price is Rs 30 per kg in Chandigarh, Bhagalpur and Shimla, according to the data.To check the price rise, the Centre has imposed minimum export price of USD 300 a tonne on onion to curb exports.The government has brought onion and potato under the Essential Commodities Act. It has also decided to amend the law to make hoarding a non-bailable offence, besides setting up a price stabilisation fund to enable states to undertake market intervention.Onion production is estimated to have risen to 192 lakh tonnes during 2013-14 crop year (July-June), from 168 lakh tonnes in 2012-13. Meanwhile, exports fell to 13.58 lakh tonnes last fiscal, from 18.22 lakh tonnes in 2012-13."
141,Fighting food inflation,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fighting-food-inflation/article6178991.ece,2014-07-05,The Hindu,"For a government that rode to power on the back of widespread dissatisfaction among people over runaway prices, especially of food commodities, the rising cost of onion and potato are posing a major challenge now. Though there is no reason to panic yet, as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said after addressing a meeting of State Food Ministers, there is little doubt that there is cause for concern mainly because the monsoon is playing truant. After its poor performance in June, the revival in July has been patchy, fuelling inflationary expectations in foodgrains and vegetables. The government believes that the expectation of a poor monsoon and consequent fall in harvests has encouraged traders and middlemen to hoard food staples such as onion and potato. The decision to bring the two vegetables under the purview of the Essential Commodities Act and imposing stock limits on them is a direct result of this reading. Simultaneously, the government has increased the minimum export price of onion to $500 a tonne; the earlier level of $300 a tonne has not been effective enough. India is one of the largest onion exporters in the world, and last year it shipped out about 1.3 million tonnes of the bulb  which was a little less than 10 per cent of the countrys total output.The move to set stock limits could also be a strategy to co-opt State governments in the fight against inflation because the role of the Centre is limited to notifying the commodity under the Essential Commodities Act. Setting of actual stock limits and cracking down on hoarders are entirely under the purview of the States. The Centre will need to work in tandem with State governments on the issue of fighting food inflation because most levers to reform the supply chain are with them. Whether it is reforming procurement practices or minimising the role of middlemen or amending the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act, the power is all with the States. At this point in time, the Centre is waging a psychological battle to douse expectations of a shortage in food commodities due to the poor monsoon, but if the monsoon fails to revive in the next couple of weeks, it will have a real fight on its hands. What should lend comfort though is the large stocks of foodgrains that it is carrying  it has already allocated an additional 50 lakh tonnes of rice for PDS distribution. The fight against food inflation is critical for the government as it will have an impact on the monetary policy of the Reserve Bank of India. Food inflation rebounded in May to 9.50 per cent after a slight dip in April, and the June data are unlikely to be encouraging  which means that easier interest rates to spur growth are now that much more distant."

145,"Potato, onion on â€˜essentialâ€™ platter",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140706/jsp/odisha/story_18584720.jsp,2014-07-06,Telegraph,"Curb on hoarding Bhubaneswar, July 5: Soaring prices of onion and potato has prompted the state government to declare the two vegetables as essential commodities and crack whip on hoarders and black marketeers. The government has asked the district collectors to intensify raids and initiate criminal proceedings against violators. The Centre has already declared these two vegetables as essential commodities. According to provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, hoarders and black marketeers are liable for criminal prosecution and the hoarded materials are to be confiscated and sold in the market. The state government is also moving the Centre to make the offence as non-bailable instead of bailable. Food supply and consumer welfare secretary Madhu Sundan Padhi said: After the Centre has brought potato and onion under the essential commodities category, we have decided to follow suit. Under the Essential Commodities Act, we have decided to fix a quota on stocks of these two items. There will be a stock limit for wholesalers and retailers. While onion prices have gone up for the third time in a fortnight to Rs 32 a kg now, potato, which was selling for Rs 18 a kg a week ago, is selling at Rs 20 today. Though the state government has asked traders to maintain a maximum gap of Rs 2.50 to Rs 3 between retail and wholesale prices of potato and a gap of Rs 3 to Rs 4 in case of onion, it seems that no one is paying any heed to it. With a shortage looming, the civil supplies and consumer welfare department today asked traders to maintain the stipulated gap or face stern action. An official said they were more concerned about onion prices as compared to potato prices. The price of potato is hovering between Rs 20 and Rs 22, but the price of onion is rising constantly, said Pratima Behera, 36, a home-maker, who stays at Nayapalli. In Berhampur, raids were conducted at Kamapali, Bijipur and Giri markets to find out whether the prescribed gap was being maintained between wholesale and retail prices. We conducted raids to review the price gap between retail and wholesale markets. Though the gap was okay, we found two shop owners at Kamapalli market selling potato and onion with non-accurate weights. We imposed compound penalty on them, said assistant civil supplies officer Purushottam Lenka. The traders were asked to display rate charts of potato and onion at all wholesale and retail shops. We have asked all shop owners to follow the instructions, said Lenka. The state government is formulating an action plan for six months to regulate the demand, supply and prices of these two essential commodities, said Padhi."

There is sufficient supply (of potato and onion) and therefore there is no reason for panic,"" the Finance Minister said.Jaitley said that Food and Consumer Affairs Department would continue to take steps to contain the rise in price of onion and potato and noted that the output of these two essential kitchen items have increased.Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said strict action would be taken against hoarders and middlemen as they are responsible for price rise.Listing the steps already taken by the government, Jaitley said the Centre has issued directive to the states to crack down on hoarding, put a cap on stockholding and hiked minimum export price for onion and potato.""For the last two years, prices of onion and potato have been rising. The then government used to wake up after prices had already risen...We started taking steps immediately when the prices touched Rs 25 per kg,"" he said.To a specific question by CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury whether futures trading on various farm commodities would be banned, the Minister did not give any commitment but said ""the government will keep the suggestion in mind.""Responding to the attack on hike in 14.2 per cent hike in rail passenger fare and 6.5 per cent raise in freight charges, Jaitley said this decision was actually taken by the UPA government on February 11 and the present government only implemented it.Railway Minister D V Sadananda Gowda, Jaitley said, had a ""Hobson's choice"" as railways' financial health was extremely bad.""Does he (Railway Minister) follow the weak-kneed policies of his predecessor that unpopular decisions can't be taken even if they are in national interest or does he then take this decision and place this fact before the country that to run the railways this decision was necessary,"" he said.Jaitley said that although the decision to raise the rail fare and freight was taken with the approval of the then Prime Minister in February, it was withdrawn within hours of implementation on May 16 as the UPA realised that it was being voted out of power.When targeted by TMC member Derek O'Brien, he hit back indirectly targeting Trinamool chief and former Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee, saying, ""I do not know whether those who handled railways in the past are the original sinners for the current situation.""On the Re 1 hike in diesel price, the Finance Minister said the government is implementing the previous UPA's policy of gradual monthly increase."
147,Modi govt policies are anti-farmer: NDAÂ ally,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/modi-govt-policies-are-anti-farmer-nda-ally/,2014-07-07,Indian Express,"Farmers leader Raju Shetti, whose party Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) is part of the NDA, Sunday criticised the agricultural policies being adopted by the Narendra Modi government. He said farmers were disappointed that the government was continuing with the anti-farmer policies of the previous government and that his party would stage protests if the decisions taken in the last few days were not revised.Shetti said he was unhappy with the government for its decision to include agriculture commodities  onion and potato  under the Essential Commodities Act and for not fulfilling the promise of ensuring 50 per cent profit over input cost of a crop.During his (Modis) election campaign, he had promised farmers that if elected he would ensure the minimum support price for agricultural products will be decided in such a way that the farmers get at least a 50 per cent profit over the total input cost for a crop. What happened now? Forget about 50 per cent profit, the new government has increased the minimum support price by only 1-2 per cent while the inflation has increased by 15-16 per cent, Shetti told reporters in Pune.Shettis party had been contesting both Lok Sabha and Assembly polls independently until 2014 Lok Sabha polls. In January 2014, when the party joined the NDA, Shetti had said the party decided to enter the alliance after he was promised that issues affecting Maharashtra farmers would be resolved.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Photo: R. AshokFor many Madurai residents, vegetable shopping at the Central Vegetable Market near Mattuthavani on Sunday morning burnt a big hole in their pockets.For the last one month, the prices of vegetables have been steadily rising. Onions, potatoes and tomatoes are sold at Rs.30 a kg today, said S. Shiva who owns a wholesale shop in the market. Selling at Rs.70 a kilo, beans proved to be one of the most expensive vegetables. Drumsticks are sold at Rs.65 a kg and avarai (country beans) and beetroot at Rs.50.We are not expecting the rates of vegetables to come down anytime soon. There has been scanty rainfall everywhere and there havent been heavy arrivals, said N. Eswaran, a vendor.Customers bargain hard but we are already not making much profit. People who used to buy in kilos buy only 250 grams to 300 grams of these vegetables, he added.Echoing his view, most vendors at the market also said that with the cost of transportation having gone up, they were hardly making money.It costs Rs.5 to transport one kilo. A train ticket to Tenkasi which used to cost us Rs.25 now costs Rs.35, said T. Muthukumar.G. Nagamani, a vendor who sells coriander, said they bought a kilo of the leaves at a whopping Rs.160. Prices used to be so low that we used to give it for free in the past, he said.With vegetables such as radish, chow chow (chayote) and brinjal costing Rs.35 a kilo, customers have no choice but to go ahead and spend heavily on vegetables.We pack lunch for our children every day and they need some variety. With vegetables such as beans costing Rs.70 a kg, we have been forced to skip preparing extra meals such as evening snacks and tiffin, said G. Balamurugan, a resident of Surya Nagar.T. Bhuvaneshwari, a resident of Kadachanendhal, said the prices of vegetables were not the only ones to hurt, the prices of meat had also doubled. While chicken cost Rs.170 a kilo, mutton costs Rs.500. Now, our household budget is in disarray, she says."
150,Attend to root,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/418322/attend-root.html,2014-07-07,Deccan Herald,"July 8, 2014, DHNS: 0:07 ISTThe steps taken by the government to curb food inflation, especially the steep and sudden rise in prices of potatoes and onions, will be watched for their results in the next few days.They are measures for the short term, and call for support of and action on the part of state governments in implementation.The prices of food items, especially potatoes and onions, have flared up on fears of a deficient monsoon and a likely fall in production in the coming months.To some extent the price rise is artificial and the government has sought to fight it with techniques out of the text book.It has increased the minimum export prices of both commodities to cut down exports and brought the two vegetables under the Essential Commodities Act.Under the ECA, governments can impose stock limits and take action against hoarders.India exports potatoes and onions but the export quantities do not amount to a large part of domestic production.So the export curbs may not have a big impact.Even without the curbs there may not be much incentive to export when the domestic prices are high. Vegetables cannot also be hoarded for a long time, because they are perishable.Stocks will naturally have to be released into the market before they perish.But the measures may lead to an increase in supplies in the short term and may also have a psychological effect.However the actions against hoarders depend on the will and efficiency of state governments whose machineries have not always been found to be up to the mark in such situations.Finance minister Arun Jaitley did well to take them on board in the fight against price rise. But the strategy will need more medium and long term measures to be sustainable and successful.The governments steps do not address the supply side problems which lie at the root of food inflation.Farm productivity has to be improved, crops should be diversified, storage facilities should be improved and infrastructure inadequacies removed to boost supplies and movements of agricultural commodities.Laws and regulations of agricultural trade will need to be changed to better protect the interests of farmers and to reduce the influence of traders and middlemen in procurement and marketing of farm produce.The state governments have a greater responsibility on these issues.The Centre and the states should work together on these reforms."

Three such vans will be pressed into service with capacity of 50 quintal (5,000 kg each). The routes have not been decided yet, but will cover the southern sectors and the colonies.The two kitchen staples will be sold at Rs 1 more than the wholesale price of that day.Danish Ashraf, joint secretary, food and supplies, said prices of onion had hit the roof and that prompted the move. ""To begin with, we have planned to set up three such vans and will later increase its number,"" said Ashraf.The department of food and supplies is already selling onions and potatoes at a controlled rate at four fair price shops (FPS) - one each at Mauli Jagran, Sector 46, Sector 37D and EWS flats in Dhanas - at `23 per kg, while the rate of these items in the market is between `28 to `32 per kg.According to officials, over 1,500 kg of onions are being sold on a daily basis at these four FPS. On directions of UT administrator Shivraj Patil, the secretary market committee provides wholesale rate of agriculture produce, especially onions and potatoes, and the district food and supplies officer (DFSO) fixes the retail prices on a daily basis.The department is also maintaining a record of arrival of onions and potatoes, and their retail and wholesale-market rates. Three sub-divisional level committees have also been constituted comprising sub-divisional magistrates (SDM), station house officers (SHOs), food supply inspector, mandi supervisor and marketing supervisor to check rates and storage of these items. The police department has been asked to do surprise checking in civil clothes to check their storage and rates.Shashi Shankar Tiwari, colonies cell president of Congress, lauded the efforts made by the administration and said it would benefit poor people residing in colonies. He demanded that the number of such centres and mobile vans be increased so that more people can be benefitted. He further asked the department to keep a close watch on FPS to ensure that they do not indulge in any malpractice."

It had said then that the company was trading in potatoes for which it had trading licence and it was dealing in agricultural and non-agricultural products.Refund moneyIn 2013, SEBI ordered Sumangal to wind up the potato investment bond schemes and refund the investors money.Activities of several companies that had raised money through collective investment schemes in the State had come to fore the after the multi-crore Saradha scam came to light in April 2013.Last month, Santanu Ghosh, the chairman and managing director of Kolkata-based Xenitis Group, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate for having dubious business dealings with the Saradha Group.Company was involved in deposit collection and Ponzi schemesInvestors complain interest on maturity of Potato Flexi bonds not paid"

This was after prices of onion and potatoes began skyrocketing. Retail markets in the city are selling both between Rs 32 and Rs 40 a kg.District Collector C.A. Latha told The Hindu on Monday that the district administration had got no communication so far from the State government in this regard. For that reason, we have not carried out any surprise checks. Possibly, we may have to seek alternative steps to check prices, she said.The onus of carrying out the crackdown on hoarding is on the State government. Subsequently, the Department of Civil Supplies in each district has to adopt measures against hoarding.Retail outlets in the city have been selling onions and potatoes without any ceiling. Onions command a price above Rs 32 a kg while potatoes, anywhere between Rs 32 and 40 a kg. Green grocers sell both the vegetables at prices depending on the wholesale market while local department stores, hyper markets and multi- brands have fixed their own prices depending on the availability.Official sources said that the State government is required to impose stock holding limits. The rule could be made applicable for the entire year. The soaring prices of vegetables have been attributed to various reasons including hoarding due to speculation that a weak monsoon would affect the kharif crop in other States.Many believe that traders are creating an artificial scarcity on onion and potatoes during the month of Ramzan. The consumption of these vegetables had grown following the rise in population of migrant workers. Onions and potatoes have been chiefly used by the labourers from the north, Ms. Latha admits.Consumers believe that the prices would shoot up unless the district administration initiates action against hoarders. The stockholding limit ensures that traders cannot stock more than a prescribed quantum."
154,Arun blames it on UPA ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140708/jsp/nation/story_18592027.jsp,2014-07-08,Telegraph,"New Delhi, July 7: Finance minister Arun Jaitley today passed the price-rise buck to the previous government, prompting the dissatisfied Opposition to walk out of the Rajya Sabha after ridiculing the BJPs pre-election promise of good days ahead. In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan did not allow an adjournment motion seeking a discussion on escalating prices. The Speaker said she was ready for a discussion under Rule 193, which does not entail voting, but the Congress refused. Repeated adjournments followed, as the budget session got off to a turbulent start. Jaitley, who was replying to a discussion on price rise, said the NDA government had taken tough decisions, including a hike in train freight rates and passenger fares that the previous government had put on hold. He accused the UPA government of not increasing the storage capacity for food grains, a key factor for price rise. Ghulam Nabi Azad, the leader of Opposition in the upper House, where the NDA is in a minority, had initiated the impromptu discussion after Jaitley agreed to a demand for one by Opposition members. Azad said the prices of essential commodities have been rising over the past one-and-a-half months and blamed the government for not being able to check the escalation. In Delhi, 1kg of onion is now selling at Rs 35 and potato at Rs 25 a kilo. Congress leader Pramod Tiwary said the rise in diesel prices and train fare rates had contributed to the increase in costs as he reminded the BJP about its pre-poll assurance of good days ahead. Trinamul Congress leader Derek OBrien criticised the government for increasing railway fares by bypassing Parliament, saying the government should have waited till the budget session. The CPMs Sitaram Yechury said the government should ban future trading in essential commodities and release grains rotting in godowns. Jaitley said there was no need to panic. On the hike in train fares, he said the UPA government had decided on increasing passenger fares and freight charges by 14 per cent and 6.4 per cent from the first week of May, and the railway board had even issued a notification. But then minister Mallikarjun Kharge left it to the next government to implement the decisions, Jaitley said, adding the railways were losing about Rs 30,000 crore a year in passenger fares. The UPA government did not take tough decisions . To run railway, this decision was necessary, the minister added. Jaitley said his government had taken a number of steps to control price rise. The government has asked states to ensure minimum stock holding of essential commodities while the minimum export price of onion has been increased from $300 to $500 per tonne. Food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the government was planning to set up storage facilities in every district. The governments response couldnt satisfy the Opposition leaders. The BJP has always highlighted price rise when we were in power and we are taking the same actions as this government. We are not happy with the reply. We are walking out, Congress veteran Azad said. Members of the CPM, Trinamul, BSP, SP and the BJD also walked out."

The unusually cool and rainy weather currently prevailing in the north is raising concerns about potato and sugar production while mustard and wheat harvests, which were earlier headed for a record, would be lower.To make matters worse, the dreaded El Nino phenomenon, in which changes in temperature in the Pacific Ocean disrupt global weather patterns including Indian monsoon, seems more likely than earlier forecasts. The bad news is that unusual weather conditions are casting a shadow on farm output and winter tourism in snowy regions as the erratic weather changes are not predictable.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events is rising. Extreme Events to Become More FrequentThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, however, says it is difficult to link any single season or event to climate change.""Hence, we are likely to see such events occurring more often and with greater intensity due to climate change in the future,"" IPCC Chairman RK Pachauri told ET. Ajit Tyagi, at the ministry of earth sciences, says such phenomena need to be studied.""While the current weather events may be a part of the natural cycle, it is possible that these are being aggravated because of climate change, which, as climate scientists have said with increasing certainty, is due to human activity."" So what can Indians expect next? To start with, ""you will still have to take a hot water bath after Holi"", said a meteorologist, referring to the general expectation that summer sets in after the festival, and the current forecasts of snow in the Himalayan states in the days ahead.""Rainfall will continue across north-west India and gradually the temperature will increase by April-May,"" said DS Pai, director (long-range forecast), India Meteorological Department.""The winter cold wave this year is much colder than normal. Abnormal winter rainfall has covered Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and other states,"" Pai said. Parts of Uttar Pradesh are still reporting a minimum temperature of 8 degrees Celsius, the level usually seen in January or early February. Ladakh and Poonch saw a deficit of over 60% in precipitation this season but snowfall was excessive in Shimla, Kullu and Mandi, which is good news for apple orchards.However, other crops would suffer. Harvests are being delayed by one or two weeks while parts of the crop have been damaged. Mustard crop across nearly 25,000 hectare has been damaged by rain in Rajasthan and parts of Haryana. ""We were looking at a bumper crop of 8 million tonnes this year. Now, we should be closer to previous year's production figure of 7.82 million tonnes,"" said Dhiraj Singh, director of the mustard and rapeseed research institute in Rajasthan. Farmers had to stall harvesting of chana across Maharashtra.""More than 1.08 lakh hectare under pulses has been damaged in Maharashtra,"" said a pulses trader from Mumbai. Chana, which was selling 10% below the minimum support price of Rs 3,100 per quintal a fortnight ago in mandis, has now crossed that level. Last week, the Indian Sugar Mills Association scaled down its sugar production estimate to 23.8 million tonnes, from 25 million tonnes, for this season. ""Due consideration has been given to weather conditions prevailing in the past several months, including heavy rainfall in certain parts of UP as well as availability of water in Maharashtra and north Karnataka and scarcity of water in Tamil Nadu,"" it said.The wheat crop is expected to be 1-2 million tonnes less than previous estimates. Output is now expected to be close to 93 million tonnes, despite higher area under cultivation. The crop has been sown over 31.5 million hectare this year, compared with 29.82 million hectare last year. Crops may suffer much more this summer if the El Nino phenomenon disrupts monsoon rains as it often, but not always, does. The phenomenon is watched globally as it causes excess rain in some parts of the world and droughts in others, including South Asia.The Australian weather office had issued an alert that some climate models suggest El Nino will affect the weather this year, but it said forecasts made at this time of the year are not very accurate. Last month, the Japan Meteorological Agency said there was a 50% chance that an El Nino would set in this summer. On Monday, the agency said the probability of the phenomenon had increased.(With inputs from Shreya Jai in New Delhi and Jayashree Bhosale in Pune)"

Farmers said, the district was a pioneer in dairy farming, but there was nothing significant for the sector.Environmentalist and Congress leader H P Mohan said, the Union government was concentrating only on development, and was neglecting ecology issues. There was nothing in the Budget, for not just the district, but for the whole State.The MPs from the State had failed to draw the attention of the Finance Minister towards the problems of the State, he said.Mohan said, an increase in the cap on farm loan to Rs 3 lakh and a decrease in the interest rate to three per cent had brought slight relief to farmers, however, the cap should have been increased to Rs 5 lakh.He welcomed the increase in the funds for Gram Sadak scheme. However, higher subsidies for solar equipment would only benefit traders.Instead, low-interest loans should have been extended to people to invest on solar equipment, he said.Secretary of Hassan District Chamber of Commerce and Industries T P Ranganath Gupta said, the demands of all people could not be met in just one budget. However, a higher limit for exemption in income tax would have helped the middle class people, he said.BJP district unit president Renukumar said, it was a good Budget for senior citizens, industrialists and farmers.Ryot leader Kanakanchehalli Prasanna Kumar said, there should have been a proposal to fix scientific price for agriculture produce.Secretary of Dwarasamudra Lake Irrigation Association Suresh Shambu said, the Budget would help those who wished to buy houses and students opting for higher education.R Vasudevamurthy, president of Holenarsipur Distributors Association, said, the Budget would help popularise electronic gadgets in rural areas also.

159,"Onion, potato price pinch in market for shoppers",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140711/jsp/bihar/story_18602561.jsp,2014-07-11,Telegraph,"Residents purchase onions in Patna on Thursday. Picture by Jai Prakash Residents have finally started feeling the steep price rise of essential vegetables like onion and potato. Onion was being sold in the range of Rs 36-44 per kg in the local market on Thursday against its recent rate of Rs 24-28. Even potato prices have gone up and good quality potato was being sold above Rs 30 per kg in the local market which was earlier available between Rs 12 and Rs 15 a kg. The residents fear that if the state government does not take any strict action against the responsible people, the situation may go out of control. This situation is prevailing in the city for last one week and the residents are feeling the pinch. The wholesale traders blamed the local market whereas the state government passed the buck to the Centre for the situation. We were buying onion for Rs 24 to Rs 28 per kg a week ago and potato for Rs 12 to Rs 15, but in the last one week, the price has gone haywire. At some places, the prices are even higher. It is a very bad situation and we fear that if it prevails for a few more days then it would be terrible for us to hit the market, said Sumit Kumar of Boring Road. On an average, Patna receives around 400 tonnes of onion and around 300 tonnes of potato daily to cater to the need of the residents. However, without any weather issues, the steep price rise of these vegetables has come as a surprise the people. Manoj Kumar of Ashiana said: It is impossible to have any dish without onion, especially the non-vegetarian ones. It is equally same with the potato, considered most essential vegetable among all. Sujeet Kumar, a wholesale trader in Mithapur market, said: There is no problem from our side and we are selling onion and potato at Rs 18-19 per kg and Rs 15-16, respectively. If it goes to local market, it should not cross more than Rs 4-6 extra. If retailers at the local market charge more than Rs 10 or Rs 12, then it is bad. They should be punished for that. There is no demand and supply issue at all and we have enough stock. Patna receives onion from Nashik and potato from Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. Ironically, most of the onion and potato produced in Patna and Nalanda districts goes to Northeast and even Nepal. About the present situation in the market, food and consumer protection minister Shyam Rajak said: Such a situation will keep on arising till the Centre does not fix a rate of onion and potato. At the same time, the Centre must also fix stock capacity and make law on hoarding as a non-bailable offence. However, about this particular situation, I have already asked the district magistrates and superintendents of police to conduct random raids to put immediate check on this practice both at wholesale and local markets. About the reason for the steep hike of these two items, agriculture expert Anil Kumar Jha said: There are many factors in case prices rise in vegetables and it does not take place in just one day. However, in such cases, it is the market forces, which play important role  the chain from wholesale to distribution of product in the market."
160,TN model 'raitara angala' to be reality in State,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/419393/tn-model-raitara-angala-reality.html,2014-07-12,Deccan Herald,"TN model 'raitara angala' to be reality in StateP M Raghunandan, Bangalore, July 12, 2014, DHNS: 3:28 ISTGovt decides not to heed Centre's advice to de-list vegetables and fruits to fight food inflationThe State government has decided not to go by the Union governments advice to de-list vegetables and fruits from the list of notified commodities under the Karnataka Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act to fight food inflation and, instead, it wants to organise raitara angala on the lines of neighbouring Tamil Nadu.As part of its efforts to contain rising prices of essential commodities, the Centre had recently asked all the States to enable the farmers to sell price-sensitive vegetables and fruits directly to consumers in the open market by de-listing them from the Act. Currently, the farmers have to sell the notified produce at the APMC mandies.Direct selling by the farmers, the Centre believes, will cut down middlemen cost and ensure win-win situation for both the producer and the consumer. The farmers normally sell their produce at APMCs through middlemen, who are widely believed to make huge profits.Almost all notified commodities change many hands  it may be a middlemen buying in bulk and him later selling to a wholesaler, the wholesaler selling to a retailer at the market level and the retailer selling it to a small shop owner  before reaching the consumers. De-listing aims to eliminate all of them in one shot and ensure direct contact between the farmers and the consumers.The decision on de-listing was taken recently at a meeting chaired by Union Food and Civil Supplies Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and attended by representatives of all State governments.The meeting also decided to fix a cap on stocking onions and potatoes.But the State government, it appears, does not believe that it would contain inflation. Vegetables and fruits are perishable commodities.A farmer has very limited means to market the produce in the short time. If a farmer has, say, 10 bags of tomatoes, she/he can sell maximum of about two to three bags to consumers.So the APMC mandies play an important role as the traders buy the entire produce, officials in the Karnataka State Agriculture Marketing department said on condition of not being quoted.Karnataka has 155 major APMC mandies and 355 small rural APMC mandies. Of the total 92 notified commodities are fruits and vegetables, including onions and potatoes, in the State.Direction to APMCsInstead, the government has decided to adopt the Tamil Nadu model of organising Raitara Angala, wherein a space will be made available at APMCs for the farmers to sell their produce directly to the consumers.Directions have been issued to all APMCs to implement it, the officials said.However, sources said, the traders had been opposing the TN model tooth and nail. Though the State government brought an amendment to the APMC Act in March this year making a provision to organise raitara angala, it has so far not taken off in any of the 510 APMCs in the State. It is feared that the traders would occupy the space meant for the farmers and thereby prevent direct selling.When contacted, Minister for Agriculture Marketing and Horticulture Shamanur Shivashankarappa, however, said his department has not received any direction in this regard from the Centre.Cap on stocking onion, potatoes soonThe State government has initiated steps to fix a cap on stocking onion and potatoes as per the Centres advice.The State is most likely to fix two truckloads as maximum limit of stocking this politically-sensitive commodities. An official notification in this regard is likely to be issued in a few days.When contacted, Commissioner for Food and Civil Supplies, Harsh Gupta, said onions and potatoes have been brought under the Essential Commodities Act in order to regulate their supply. Appropriate steps will be taken on fixing a cap on stocking them after holding consultation with the government, he added.Appropriate decision will be taken after receiving the Centres letter in this regard, he added."
161,Middlemen under lens to tame food inflation,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/419527/middlemen-lens-tame-food-inflation.html,2014-07-13,Deccan Herald,"Mayank Bhardwaj & Rajesh Kumar Singh, July14, 2014, Reuters: 21:25 ISTEvery few weeks, farmer Jay Narayan Singh hauls onions and potatoes in a hired lorry to a wholesale market an hour's drive from his home in the country's northern plains, only to sell his vegetables at a quarter of the prices retail consumers pay.A law that dates back more than 50 years forces Singh and millions of other farmers to sell produce in regulated markets where middlemen take a hefty cut, boosting the cost of fruit and vegetables sold from handcarts and corner shops.""The market is nothing but a haven for a clique of middlemen who indulge in profiteering, depriving both farmers and consumers of a fair price,"" Singh said.As food inflation nears 10 per cent, the new government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces accusations that it is doing no better at reining in prices than the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty's Congress party, which suffered its worst election defeat in May.Determined to avoid a repeat of the inflation scourge that contributed to the Congress downfall, Modi is taking aim at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act.The law aims to protect farmers from exploitation by rich landlords, and requires all produce to be sold through regulated markets in most of the 29 states. Even big retailers, such as Reliance Industries, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Shoppers' Stop and Britain's Tesco Plc, can only buy through wholesale markets governed by the Act.But critics say too many people in the supply chain seek a cut, which exaggerates price rises during India's frequent supply disruptions because of a perennial shortage of storage.Modi's food and finance ministers are now pushing states to let fruit and vegetable farmers sell to anyone they want, ending a practice that governs more than 7,000 wholesale markets.""Allowing direct purchases will be a win-win proposition,"" said farmer Ved Prakash Sharma, as he oversaw labourers unloading sacks of vegetables at the Hapur wholesale market, about 60 km from the Indian capital, New Delhi.Many middlemen who benefit from the system are supporters of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which needs to keep voters sweet ahead of assembly polls due this year in Delhi, Haryana and Maharashtra.Even some farmers could baulk at any assault on traders, who are often a source of credit in hard times after drought or crop failure.Bargaining powerAn opaque system of auction by traders' cartels leaves farmers with scant bargaining power. Farmers who travel long distances to market often cannot afford to return home without a sale, said Naveen Yadav, a farmer who brought a truckload of okra to Hapur.""After extensive research we found that the total margin of middlemen in the entire chain adds up to 75 per cent, ramping up costs for consumers,"" said Gokul Patnaik, chairman of GlobalAgri System, a Delhi-based farm consultancy.In other countries where the food supply chain is better integrated, the margin ranges from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, he added.Excluding fruit and vegetables from the APMC Act would cut prices by at least 5 per cent because direct selling would cut out middlemen's commissions and wholesale market fees, he said.Numerous middlemen also add to a high rate of spoilage, as cargoes get repeatedly loaded and unloaded.That leads to wastage of as much as a quarter of the value of goods, with consumers paying the cost, Patnaik said.Levies such as wholesale market fees, purchase and sales taxes, and weighing and loading charges also boost final prices. Some states add a tax to fund welfare programmes, such as Punjab, where levies add up to nearly 15 per cent of the value of goods.Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan favours a uniform market in which farmers can sell whatever, and wherever, they want.Farming forms 14 per cent of India's nearly $2-trillion economy and employs more than half its 1.2-billion population.Debate over foreign playersStamping out middlemen is not a panacea. The government will have to give private players incentives to invest in alternative large markets, said Ashok Gulati, an agriculture expert at economic policy think-tank ICRIER.Middlemen still thrive in Bihar, the only state to have junked the Act, because it offered no alternative arrangement to growers, such as private markets or direct purchase centres.Trying to modernise the food supply chain by meddling with every stage and every product would only lead to failure, a group of senior government officials warned recently.""One way of playing an enabling role is to allow foreign direct investment into multi-product retail,"" they said in an internal memo.Modi's BJP has ruled out FDI in supermarkets, however. Losing patience, Wal-Mart has dropped a wholesale joint venture with a local firm and France's Carrefour plans to close its four wholesale stores in India."

The survey report will help in chalking out developmental programmes and implementing them in Chadegaon and similar villages.The village has sufficient water supply and round-the-clock electricity. About 90% of the farmers own less than three acres of land.Shamna N, a fish nutritionist from Kerala, said, ""This is an agricultural village in urban area and yields 17 crops. Moreover, livestock rearing is done here and all the modern farming technology and inorganic fertilizers are used. But there are pest problems here.""Thoke said the cost of producing vegetables is very high. Besides, the villagers also face dog menace, who eat up their potatoes and tomatoes.""The villagers cannot maintain purity of the animals. Most are foreign bred and hence, the purity can be maintained only till a certain extent i.e., around 60-65%. With the help of coolers, they try to maintain the kind of atmosphere that the animal is used to,"" said Dr Pradip Gandhale, veterinary virologist from Ahmednagar.The solutions suggested by the scientists include integrated pest management, knowledge-based training, disease forecasting using information technology, skill development, soil testing, using fertilizers based on soil testing report, outside grafting of grapes and market-oriented cropping pattern.Upasana Yadav, a food technologist from New Delhi, said, ""The climatic condition is suitable for all crops here.

It was 6 per cent in May.Even then, there was little relief for the common man as wholesale prices of vegetables grew month-on-month at the rate of 16 per cent in June with the inflation rate for potatoes being 12.22 per cent and that for onions 16 per cent, according to the official release issued.Prices of vegetables, though on a downward trend, continued to remain elevated despite a series of steps from the Modi Government for a crack-down on high food inflation. These include restrictions on exports of key kitchen commodities.Food prices are likely to continue to remain under pressure owing to the drought warnings for the year even though the government has said it has adequate foodgrain stocks.The wholesale price index for fuels grew at 9 per cent in June. With India importing 75 per cent of its crude oil requirement, global fuel price pressures are also likely to be an additional pressure on inflation. Brent crude that had plunged to a three-month low rose above $106 a barrel on Monday over the ongoing tensions in Libya and Iraq.The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) issued a statement saying even though manufacturing inflation had recorded a marginal rise, what was noteworthy was that items such as rice, wheat, vegetables, onions, among others had shown a decline.Positive signalThe moderation in inflation together with the rebound in industrial production, as per the recently released data, provides a positive signal that the structural bottlenecks afflicting the economy could be gradually showing signs of receding and greenshoots of recovery could be around the corner, said Chandrajit Banerjee, Director-General, CII.Food inflationPTI reports:Retail inflation fell to 30-month low of 7.31 per cent in June, mainly on account of lower prices of food items, including vegetables, cereals and meat.The retail inflation, measured on consumer price index (CPI), was 8.28 per cent in May.

Picture by Bijoy kr Sharma Dhubri, July 14: Trucks carrying potatoes and onions from Bengal, which were stranded in two inter-state checkgates, started moving towards Assam after 2pm today. The Bengal government instructed the Cooch Behar district administration not to give clearance to the trucks to enter Assam on July 11, an official of Joraimore checkgate in Bengal said. Nearly 250 trucks were stranded in Bengal at Barobhisa, Joraimore and Jorakata near Assam-Bengal inter-state checkgates at Chagolia and Srirampur of Dhubri and Kokrajhar districts for last couple of days owing to the non-clearance by transport and sales tax department of Bengal. Anil Das, one of the retailers in Dhubri market, alleged that unscrupulous traders taking advantage of the situation shot up the prices of potatoes and onions in lower Assam in the wholesale markets. As a result, prices of these commodities went up to Rs 25 to 28 and Rs 35 to 40 per kg in retail markets in the past two days. Stockists and hoarders, too, created an artificial scarcity in the market despite availability of buffer stock in the district for at least 15 days, a source said. An official source in Dhubri said at the instance of Dispur, the matter was taken up today with the Cooch Behar district administration and then it agreed to give clearance to the trucks. Dhubri deputy commissioner Kumud Chandra Kalita told The Telegraph that when he contacted the Cooch Behar administration, he learnt that transportation of potatoes and onions from Bengal was not only stopped for Assam but for the rest of the country too. The matter was settled as the Cooch Behar administration agreed to allow the trucks to head towards their destinations today. In fact, as officials reported from Chagolia, trucks crossed the inter-state checkgate and entered Assam, Kalita added. However, truckers in Chagolia and Srirampur alleged that they were being allowed to transport the potatoes and onions after greasing the palms of the transport and sales tax officials at the checkgates. Through brokers, we pay Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 for each truck of potatoes and onions respectively to manage Bengal and Assam police and officials, a trucker said. State minister for food and civil supplies and consumer affairs Nazrul Islam today said at a high-level meeting, convened by chief minister Tarun Gogoi, that there was no shortage of onions or potatoes or any other essential commodity in the state. Altogether 29 trucks reached the state yesterday. Onions are also scheduled to arrive from Nashik at Changsari railway station here tomorrow."

This was announced in a meeting convened by chief minister Tarun Gogoi at his office here today. During the meeting, senior officials of the state food and civil supplies and consumer affairs department, the nodal department for implementing the act, apprised Gogoi of the slew of measures that have been taken for implementation of a particular scheme. Minister for food and civil supplies and consumer affairs, Nazrul Islam, chief secretary Jitesh Khosla, additional chief secretary of finance, H.S. Das, principal secretary of food and civil supplies and consumer affairs, S.L. Mewara, principal secretary to chief minister, Jishnu Barua and other senior officials were present at the meeting. Gogoi urged the officials to ensure that the scheme is implemented efficiently in the state and actually benefits those for whom it is meant. He also directed them to ensure that sufficient quantity of commodities are available in Amar Dukan, the states fair price shops, take concrete and effective steps to prevent hoarding and black-marketing of necessary commodities and maintain a steady supply line to create a balance between their demand and supply. Adequate arrangements have to be made to check the prescribed stock limit of essential commodities from time to time so that no criminal element can indulge in artificial shortage by way of hoarding of necessary articles, leading to black-marketing, Gogoi said. The government also plans to bring onions and potatoes in the list of essential commodities to curb hoarding. The step will help undertake de-hoarding operations and control the prices of onions and potatoes. All officials concerned should send a list of regular stocks and prices of essential items, including onions and potatoes, to the media on a daily basis so that the consumers are made aware of it, Gogoi said. Officials of the legal meteorology department were also asked to carry out inspections of weighing scales and weight equipment in the grocery and in vegetable, fuel and other retail outlets so that they cannot dupe unsuspecting consumers. Gogoi also suggested opening up of a farmers market to ensure that farmers are able to sell their produce to the consumers directly so that they earn the right price without the middlemen milking the profits."

Households will be forced to cut down on vegetables, says P.A.

Onion, tomato and potato are consumed throughout the year and since the local stock of these vegetable ends soon, Punjab is mostly dependent on its neighbouring state of Himachal Pradesh for their supply.According to some vegetable wholesalers, in Himachal Pradesh also, there has been more than 30% shortage in rainfall and this has affected the crop very badly.Delay in rainfall has affected almost all the states in the country, including the colder states like Himachal Pradesh. This eventually affects prices of vegetables. Even in HP, prices have gone up, said SK Kumar, vegetable retailer in Maqsuda Mandi.Since the traders are getting vegetables at higher prices than last year, the prices in the market have gone considerably higher.The prices of tomato and onion have gone up as compared to last month but it has not affected our business a lot since onion and tomato are basic food items and used in all Indian households. Even if there is a price rise, people will buy it. Though people complain about the price rise, we have not faced any loss in the business, Kumar said.Nancy Sharma, a housewife said, Price rise in the vegetable is a big problem for us. Food is the basic need and even if the prices are high, we have to purchase vegetables. We get a fixed salary but the prices of vegetables and other commodities are considerably increasing. It becomes difficult for us to manage our kitchen.Dimpi Sachdeva, a wholesaler, said that if a weak monsoon continues, the prices of some vegetables in the future can reach up to Rs 100 per kg. The region desperately needs rains if we want to see the stability in prices of vegetables,he said."

Nowadays, vegetables get easily rotten. Moreover, weather production these days, leading to increase in the prices of vegetables, said Kuljit Singh, a farmer and agriculturist from Amritsar.After I sell a vegetable to the wholesaler for Rs 10 he adds Rs 2 or more while selling it to the retailer, who in turn, increases Rs 6-7 further when selling it to the consumer, he added.Manav Taneja, a vegetable exporter, says, In May, June and July, export of potatoes is very less. Delay in rainfall, shortage in supply of crops coupled with small retailers increasing the prices adds to price rise.The prices vary from area to area as well. In the walled city localities such as Logarh the price would be less as compared to Lawrence Road, he added.In last two to three weeks, there has been a Rs 20-30 increase in prices of many vegetable. The prices of some have even gone up by Rs 40 per kg. I am selling capsicum and lemon at Rs 80 per kg and cauliflower at Rs 50 per kg. The price of onion and tomato havs also increased by Rs 20 each but there no change in demand, a woman vegetable vendor said.We have to pay for transportation also. At present, the production of vegetables has gone down while the consumption has increased. The demand for cucumber, gourd etc is more while the supply is less as it usually happens during the summer. This is the time when vegetable vendors and shopkeepers get a chance to earn, Bharat Bhushan, another vegetable seller said.When there is price rise dhabha owners too feel helpless. We have to bear the brunt of price rise. We cannot even increase the price of cooked vegetables as it will directly affect our clientele. We have to increase prices in case the vegetable prices do not come down for a longer time and that too by maximum Rs 5-10, said Kala, a dhabha owner"

Assam food and civil supplies minister Nazrul Islam told reporters here today that over 40,000 metric tonnes of potato were stocked in 14 cold storages and there was no possibility of shortage of the vegetable. Guptas comment was an attempt to create confusion among the public and thereby trigger a price rise. I have asked the district administration to lodge an FIR and arrest him immediately, Islam said. When asked by The Telegraph, Gupta said he had made no such comment and said he would file a defamation case against the minister. This is a false allegation and I will send a legal notice to the minister tomorrow, he said. Gupta, who is associated with the Assam Chamber of Commerce, is also a general secretary of the state unit of the BJP. The minister today, however, alerted that there was possibility of further hike in prices of potatoes and onions after August. We are still obtaining potatoes and onions straight from the farmers but after August, we may have to buy the two vegetables from traders as farming would be over. The traders will hoard them and may try to increase prices according to their will. So there is a possibility of a further increase in prices of the two essential commodities after August, Islam said. Consumer rights activists here said strict action against traders spreading rumours of price rise was necessary but the minister committed the same crime by saying there will be further hike in prices after August. Potato prices had increased following reports that truckloads of the vegetable were stranded at the Assam-Bengal checkgates because of non-clearance from the Bengal transport and sales tax department. The trucks, however, started moving towards Assam after the state government here intervened and took it up with the Bengal government. The minister said retail prices of potato in the markets here at present was between Rs 22 and Rs 26 while onion was sold from Rs 26 to Rs 40. Asked why the state government could not check price rise of the two vegetables, Islam put the blame on the Narendra Modi government and said checking inflation was the Centres job. Nobody is hoarding in the state and prices have gone up because of hoarding at the sources. The Centre should take strong steps against hoarding. The Modi government had promised acche din but now they are saying acche din ayega, Islam said. The minister asked consumers to use a helpline (9864055550) to lodge complaints on price rise."

176,BJP seeks inquiry into â€˜potato crisisâ€™,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140719/jsp/northeast/story_18629471.jsp,2014-07-19,Telegraph,"A worker sleeps at a wholesale market in Nagaon. (PTI) Guwahati, July 18: The Assam unit of the BJP today demanded an inquiry into why only 19 traders were controlling the business of potatoes and onions in the state, resulting in frequent increase in the prices of the two commodities. The state government has not set up a single cold storage in Guwahati where as only 19 traders under the banner of Potato and Onion Merchants Association is controlling the business of the two commodities for long. The state government has no control over the supply of the two commodities and as a result the prices go up based on the wishes of the traders, the party vice-president Siddhartha Bhattacharjee said here. The party sought an inquiry if the traders were running a syndicate of the two items. The demand comes days after an FIR was lodged against BJP leader and businessman Vijay Kumar Gupta for allegedly making a statement on July 15 that the state had stocks of potatoes for one day. The state food and civil supplies minister, Nazrul Islam, had directed the Kamrup (metro) district administration to lodge the FIR alleging that Guptas statement had triggered panic about increase in prices of potatoes. Gupta, however, denied the allegation and said he would file a defamation case against the minister. The controversy started following reports that truckloads of potatoes coming from Bengal were stranded on the Assam-Bengal checkgates for sales tax inspection. The trucks, however, started moving towards Assam following the state governments intervention. The minister on Tuesday said Gupta had provided misleading information to reporters about stocks of potatoes where as there were 40,000 metric tonnes of potatoes in stocks. Gupta today challenged the minister and dared him to publish a white paper on how potatoes and onions coming from outside the state were allocated to traders by the Potato and Onion Merchants Association. The BJP said the traders were taking advantage of the ongoing political crisis within the Congress and increasing prices. The state machinery is almost non-functional because of the internal crisis in the ruling Congress. Traders are taking this advantage, Bhattacharjee said."
177,'System of Rice Intensification' Better Way of Paddy Plantation,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/system-of-rice-intensification-better-way-of-paddy-plantation/story-kVbwu8ymnuXq0y3o81X7OP.html,2014-07-20,Hindustan Times,"With climate change, soil degradation and water becoming an important cost, the 'System of Rice Intensification' (SRI) offers disadvantaged farming households better option of paddy transplantation.A truant monsoon is in the offing, with El Nino weather patterns expected to bring about drier conditions. India has the world's largest area devoted to rice, a very water-intensive crop. Experts feel that this is the right time for giving impetus to 'more crop per drop' practice during the current rice-growing kharif season.Chief agriculure officer, Dr Ravi Kumar Sabharwal, says, ""The SRI is in step with the goal of enhanced food production keeping water availability in mind. With enhanced industrial and domestic demands, the demand for water is increasing and the agriculture sector is expected to adapt to a water discipline without letting up on the demand for increased agricultural produce. For small and marginal farmers, SRI can be a game changer because of reduced input requirement"".The SRI method involves only reorganising the way in which available resources are managed. It was in Madagascar, some 30 years ago, that the SRI technique was developed by a Jesuit priest, Henri de Laulanie.""In India, it was first tried out in Tamil Nadu in 2000-01, following which several states have demonstrated higher rice production using less water,"" Sabharwal adds.CLIMATE-SMARTAgricultural development officer, Dr Amrik Singh, points out, ""As pressures mount to ensure that every drop of water counts, SRI is seen today as climate-smart agriculture'. Benefits of SRI include lower costs, improvement in soil health, and the capacity to withstand biotic (pest and disease) and abiotic (climatic) pressures"". It is estimated that there are now over five million farmers using SRI worldwide. In more than 50 countries wherein the benefits of SRI have already been demonstrated, there has been a 30-50% decrease in water use compared to growing the same varieties on similar soil under flooded conditions, Dr Sabharwal claims.Professor Norman Uphoff of Cornell University, who is credited with spreading the word about Laulanie's work, sees the principles of SRI as being quite different to the first Green Revolution of the mid-1960s, which focused on improving yields through breeding new traits, using agrochemicals to enhance soil nutrients and providing assured irrigation. That resulted in adverse ecological effects"", says Dr Sabharwal.According to Prof Uphoff, in the 21st century, with water becoming an important cost and constraint, with soil degradation and shrinking land resources and climate change adverse impacts, SRI offers millions of disadvantaged farming households better opportunities. There are no patents, royalties or licensing fees - only the farmer benefits from SRI.INDIAN EXPERIMENTSRI started early in Tamil Nadu. With scientific and extension support from Tamil Nadu State University, the area under SRI management has now reached about half of the state's rice area. In Tripura, from just 44 farmers using the methods in 2002, the number has increased to about 3,50,000 on 1,00,000 hectares, nearing half of that state's rice area. Bihar started it with only a few hundred farmers in 2007; four years later, the area under SRI was reported to be about 10% of the state's rice area, with a target area of 40% set for 2013-14, Dr Sabharwal adds.Some SRI results have made headlines. Two years ago, Sumant Kumar from Nalanda in Bihar set a record by claiming a harvest of 22.4 tonnes of rice per hectare. S Sethumadhavan from Alanganallur in Tamil Nadu reported a yield of nearly 24 tonnes per hectare. While both these claims were verified by the state governments, they have been challenged by agricultural scientists who dismiss them as beyond the biological maximum.A woman farmer, T Amalarani of Vasudevanallur, who harvested 18 tonnes per hectare, was awarded the 'Krishi Karman Award' by the President in January this year. The votaries of SRI tend to play down these super-yields as statistical ""outliers,"" on the premise that it is the averages which are more significant than the extremes.CONSTRAINTSSRI is generally considered to be labour-intensive, one of the constraints to its rapid adoption. This characteristic has prompted possibilities of linking it with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS). Labour is required for more weeding, on-farm water control, and organic fertiliser application. Under the MNREGS, works can be taken up on private farms of small and marginal farmers. SRI methods have also been used in crops like wheat, sugarcane, millets, potato and rapeseed-mustard, with similar benefits as for rice.""The rice-growing season is here. The disposition of the rain gods is speculative. Inter-state water wars are getting fiercer. An SRI movement is stirring and beginning to win some battles. Public policy and research must lead from the front in this area and not merely react. The time is ripe to champion the SRI cause,"" says Dr Amrik Singh."
178,Paswan talks law tweak to pin hoarders,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140721/jsp/bihar/story_18635539.jsp,2014-07-21,Telegraph,"Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan addresses the news meet in Patna on Sunday. Picture by Ranjeet Kumar Dey Union consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister Ram Vilas Paswan said on Sunday amendments in Essential Commodities Act would be brought in the ongoing Parliament session. The amendments would bring in stern laws to check the influence of hoarders who suddenly hike the prices of onions, potatoes and other vegetables. Under the said amendments, an alleged hoarder would face non-bailable charges. Earlier, the offence was bailable, taking the advantage of which many persons secured bail easily after committing the crime. Paswan, who was in Patna, said: The government has enough stock of essential commodities and there is no worry for common people. A few weeks ago, there was a sudden rise in prices of essential commodities but the government successfully checked that. A person booked for hoarding was kept in judicial custody for a maximum of six months earlier but that has been extended to one year under the amendments. Paswan also blamed the state government for introducing the Food Security Act without proper planning. The state government introduced the act on March 4 this year without identifying the beneficiaries, he said. Under the Food Security Act, the brainchild programme of the UPA government, every individual living below the poverty line gets 3kg rice and 2kg wheat in a month. In Bihar, there are around 7.7 crore people covered under the Food Security Act. Around 84 per cent of the rural populace, which is around 6.9 crore, and 70 lakh people in urban areas are covered under the act. However, the state minister for food and consumer protection Shyam Rajak said: The state government has seriously implemented the Food Security Act and the ministers (Paswans) observations are without facts. The minister also spoke of bringing changes to common agriculture marketing system under which farmers can sell their product in other states too. Paswan had recently attributed the sudden price rise of vegetables such as potato, tomato and onion to hoarders stocking them up for two or three days to create an artificial shortage and panic, but the production figures proved no shortage. According to the figures presented by the Union minister in 2012-13, the production of potatoes was 453 lakh metric tonnes, which went up to 464 lakh metric tonnes in 2013-14. Similarly, onion production last year was 168 lakh metric tonnes, which went up to 193 lakh metric tonnes. In 2012-13, the wheat production was 935 lakh metric tonnes, which went up to 960 lakh metric tonnes. Similarly, rice production was 1,050 lakh metric tonnes and increased to 1,062 lakh metric tonnes."

The world will have a generation of idiots.THINKSTOCKYoungsters today spend hours texting on smartphones.The truth in what Einstein said all those years ago cannot seem too out of context when placed in today's world. One of the advantages of the modern era is highly advanced technology which has transformed the entire world into a global village.

In fact, one can avoid seven miles in heavy traffic as well to meet loved ones.With just a click, one could text, send a voice note or even video chat, as if sitting next to the person on the other end. However, everything comes with a price including the numerous marvels of technology, which has without doubt created several voids in our social lives.One such major void is the declining quality of social interaction.With technology gripping our lives in a stronghold, relationships have become virtual, especially for those who are more introverted, said Deepika Sharma, 22, a student of UIAMS, Panjab University at Chandigarh.Youngsters today spend hours surfing social networking sites and chatting or texting on their smartphones.Another PU student, Namita Thakur, 23, said, ""The issue has both its pros and cons.

180,Tomato Prices Soar at Rs 65 a Kg,http://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tomato-prices-soar-at-rs-65-a-kg/story-GWN1Ixn6qfew44u87QEJzJ.html,2014-07-26,Hindustan Times,"Prices of tomatoes, the essential vegetable that adds tanginess to our diet, has increased 50% over the past week to be selling at `60 per kg. Other essential staples of the kitchen have also seen an increase of around 20%, with potatoes available at `35 per kg against last week's price of around `25 per kg. Onions is also available at `40 per kg, even as traders claim that during this season, its prices usually hover around `25 per kg.Several reasons are being advanced for the increase in prices. Poor monsoon and hoarding by vegetable vendors are being cited. However, vendors at the Sector 26 market claim that heavy rains in Himachal Pradesh and the scanty rainfall in some Southern parts of the country had affected supply, pushing up the prices.Vijay Kumar, a vendor in the sector 26 vegetable market said, ""The supply of tomatoes has been the worst-hit. We are getting only a limited supply of tomatoes due to lower production than last year and with weather vagaries, some stock also gets spoilt. All this has led to the hike in prices.""He added that this was the peak supply season for tomatoes, but because of heavy rain in Himachal Pradesh they had been getting less than the required quantity. Jitender, another trader, said: ""In monsoon, the supplies are usually hit.""Officials with the UT administration claim that steps have taken to check been hoarding and the deputy commissioner had been conducting raids in the market.The administration's mobile vans scheme had received a good response and soon special carts and stalls would be set up to sell onions and tomatoes at a no-profit-no-loss basis, an official said."
181,Govt needs to fix the cold storages to tackle price rise,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/422373/govt-needs-fix-cold-storages.html,2014-07-28,Deccan Herald,"Govt needs to fix the cold storages to tackle price riseAnnapurna Singh, July 29, 2014, DHNS: 22:41 ISTThe onion and potato crisis faced by the NDA government soon after assumption of office, is far from over. Another of an equal dimension, has been added. Welcome to a 500 per cent rise in tomato prices!And this makes the staple ingredients in every kitchen out of reach of the common man. Its not that the government which came to power on the commitment of protecting the poor from price rise, has not done anything: It raised the minimum export price of onion and potato manifold and issued orders to the states to bring in force a law that helps curb prices of the two kitchen items. After doing these, it also claimed in Parliament that prices of vegetables have stabilised. But, what is the net result? Barring in Delhi, where the prices have receded, though marginally, no other state has so far implemented any of the centrally directed steps to check prices of perishables. While onion is selling anywhere between Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg in Delhi and in neighbouring cities, In southern India, it is no better.So, the prices have actually not come down despite governments claim and thats why new tenders for importing some 70,000 tonnes of onions have been floated. Imports will be done from Pakistan, China, Iran and Iraq. The government fears there can be another spike in prices in coming months as subdued rainfall has delayed the new crop.The potato story is no different. When prices were going through the roof in the months of May and early June, traders confirmed that 1,500 to 2,000 tonnes of potatoes were being exported to Pakistan every day through Attari-Wagah land route to meet production shortage in the neighbouring country. It was much later that the government woke up to check 70-80 truck loads of potatoes being ferried to Pakistan everyday. By then much of the spud was out of an average Indian plate.Now, it is the turn of tomatoes. Their prices have zoomed and the Dehliites have to shell out Rs 100 for buying one kg from the retail market. In the South again, there is some respite but nothing below Rs 60 per kg. According to governments own admission, the prices of tomato were as high as Rs 85 per kg in Bhopal, Rs 80 per kg in Kanpur and Portblair this week.The price rise in vegetables is a seasonal phenomenon and it occurs during peak summer months of May to September. While last year heavy rains had onion prices soaring, this year it is unseasonal showers that have affected the summer crop.But, the question is, does the government have a policy in place to deal with the recurring problem? Why is that every year panic prompts the ruling dispensation swing into action?Each time the prices of perishables rise, the government declares a war against hoarders, especially of cerials and vegetables. States are asked to take stringent action. Centre on its part, halts exports, opens more imports and prices subside for a short term. But, does hoarding really pose a risk in perishables? It is still being debated for a simple reason that the shelf life of vegetables is very short. In fact, traders say the they are forced to export onions and potatoes because there is not much warehousing facility in India. They also claim that sudden focus on hoarding and black marketing is the governments excuse for its inaction.Welcome moveThe recent step to check prices through putting onion and potato under the Essential Commodities Act is welcome as it will temporarily bring the stocks into the market and check prices but the real problem lies with that of production and distribution system. The government needs to look at what is causing the repeated disruptions particularly in onions in past three-four years.The new food minister Ram Vilas Paswan has given a simple solution to the seemingly complex problem. According to him, the cyclical price rise in vegetables can be arrested merely by creating 15-20 more godowns. If his assertion is true that problems exist only due to lack of storage space for vegetables and fruits, then it is worse that even after 67 years of independence, India could not create those 15 to 20 godowns.It is true that India does not have many cold storages in the country but what about the existing cold chains that are non functional? These existing cold chains are gasping for breath due to acute power shortage. And a recent statement by Federation of Cold Storage Associations of India that the Rs 18,000 crore cold storage industry in the country is on the verge of collapse unless government gives power subsidy sums up their woes. Cold storages are highly energy consuming and unless the government comes forward to fix the problem, no amount of foreign direct investment can work in the food storage business. Power crisis is the major reason why private entrepreneurs have not come forward in public-private-partnership programmes in this area.On an average, India produces 85 million tonnes of vegetables and 45 million tonnes of fruits per annum. Over 30 per cent of the produce is lost due to inadequate storage. Secondly, there is no proper distribution of storage facility in the country. Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have over 65 per cent of the cold storage units and the rest are spread across the country.India is the worlds second largest producer of onions behind China and produces up to 18 million tonnes in a year. A crisis in onions is certainly due to absence of larger reforms in the country. Experts have always pointed towards improvement in supply chain. An improvement in roads, transport and agriculture storage facility can solve the recurring problems in vegetable shortage. If these are treated on priority, there will be no need for any import."

The ban on sale of potato outside the State was imposed early last month.The State has still a stock of about 32 lakh tonnes of potato which would help the State meet its demand till December till the next crop is available, Mr. Bose said.The State government has already arranged to open fair price shops for vegetables in about 19 markets in the city and steps are being taken to increase the number, he said. President of the Forum of Traders Organisation Pashim Banga, Rabindra Nath Koley, also a member of the task force, claimed that the vegetable price has already come down and the situation is much better in North Bengal.Only potato is costlier in North Bengal than in South Bengal because of transportation cost, he said.Mr. Bose further said the Chief Minister suggested to enhance production of fish in the State to meet its growing demand.

It was 916 MT in 2012-13.She said that Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) has issued separate advisories to exporters of vegetables to Saudi Arabia and to exporters of potatoes to Russia asking them to follow quality norms specified by importing nations.Replying to a separate question, the minister said that the scope for further increase in tax rates on apple without further negotiation under the WTO regime seems unlikely at present.The present import duty is 50 per cent which is also the bound rate of duty agreed in WTO.The top four countries which export apples to India include Chile, China, New Zealand and the US.She said that the ministerial mandate of the WTO's Doha Round recognised that developing countries should have the right to select an appropriate number of agricultural tariff lines (products) as special products in the interest of their food security, livelihood security and rural development needs.Such products would either undergo no reductions in import duties or would have to undergo lower reductions.""These provisions will, however, come into effect after an agreement is reached and the Doha Round is concluded. However, inclusion of apple as a special product will be considered as and when this department takes up the exercise of identifying special products on conclusion of the Doha Round,"" she added."
186,Karbi ginger farmers take to tapioca ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140801/jsp/northeast/story_18673046.jsp,2014-08-01,Telegraph,"Tapioca Jorhat, July 31: Nearly 7,000 ginger farmers in Karbi Anglong district have taken up commercial cultivation of tapioca, considered the poor mans potato. The farmers, who have formed an organisation called Ginfed, hope to tap into the commercial value of the crop after it is processed into flour, starch, semolina and saboodana. Jiten Sarang Fangsa, marketing manager, Ginfed, told The Telegraph over phone from Diphu, the district headquarters, that though Karbi Anglong was the highest producer of tapioca known locally as himolu alu in the region, the crop was usually consumed locally after boiling it. The Assam Agricultural University showed us the commercial viability of the crop. Some of us tried it out last year and after being able to sell the flour in various expos and melas at about Rs 50-60 per kg, many more have taken to the crop this season, Fangsa said, adding that he had also cultivated about 100 plants. Fangsa said while the flour was instantly sold out in neighbouring Nagaland but in Assam, people were not aware of its value and were not so keen to buy it. Tapioca flour has to be added to wheat flour in a 50:50 ratio so that chapattis, cakes, biscuits and other items can be made. Compared to rice and wheat, tapioca (dry) has less fat (0.3 per cent) than rice (milled) (0.6) and whole wheat (2.7). It also has more carbohydrate (82.6 per cent) than rice (78.2) and wheat (69.4). However, the protein content in tapioca (dry) is less (1.3 per cent) compared to rice (6.8) and whole wheat (12.1). Regarding the high cost of the flour compared to wheat, Priyanka Das, scientist, biochemistry department of Assam Agricultural University, said in the south of the country, tapioca flour sold for Rs 30 per kg but here most likely the raw material was procured at a high price owing to which the price became high. Das said tapioca was an indigenous tuber crop, which could be grown at a very low cost. Apart from its value as a processed food like flour or semolina, we want the farmers to benefit from extraction of the starch from the plant as India is still very dependent on import of tonnes of starch from neighbouring Thailand and Indonesia. Tapioca has the largest amount of pure starch, more than any other crop, including rice or potato and is of much value in the textile, paper and food industries, she said. The AAU has provided an electric dryer and other equipment for processing whereas the army under its Sadbhavana project has provided equipment worth about Rs 9 lakh, which includes grinders, peelers, drying trays, water pump and tanks, among others. The state agriculture department has also provided three dryers, of which one uses LPG and two machines use wood. The 7,009 farmers under Ginfed had till now grown ginger, turmeric and bhut jolokia but have decided that they will try out tapioca, on a small scale initially and if found profitable, go in for larger production. S. Sandhan, deputy director (hills), state agriculture department, Karbi Anglong, said the greatest problem in the district was the extremism problem apart from the high transportation cost and almost no equipment to process the produce at a low cost. In India, Assam stands sixth in tapioca production and Kokrajhar is another place in the state where tapioca is produced in a large scale."

There is no possibility of government formation in the current Assembly through constitutional means. Yet the city administration and the Central Government are not dissolving the Assembly and paving the way for fresh elections.The BJP seems to be enjoying ruling Delhi through the Lieutenant-Governor. Does not this amount to authority without accountability? Delhi is reeling under power cuts; food inflation has shot up many times over; cost of tomatoes, potatoes have skyrocketed. Delhi deserves an elected government that the people can hold accountable, he said.Electricity costs have been raised, yet the Central Government does not want to take accountability for the mess it has created in the city. The fact that the BJP does not want to get peoples mandate through the L-G, shows that it is scared of the polls and is sure that it would loose the polls, he said.The AAP leader also gave an ultimatum of a week to the Lieutenant-Governor to dissolve the Delhi Assembly and make way for fresh polls in the city. We are giving a weeks time to the government. If they do not dissolve the Assembly, we will undertake door-to-door and signature campaign and demand dissolution of the Assembly so that fresh elections can be conducted,Claiming that by delaying polls the BJP was only helping the AAP. If elections are conducted now, the AAP will get 40 seats, if it is conducted in October, we will get 50 and 55 in February.Over 9,000 people from about seventy Assembly constituencies participated in the rally but the metropolis was visibly absent from the crowd, which was largely constituted by slum dwellers, labourers, auto-drivers and residents of rural Delhi.The AAP leader also for the first time criticised the Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung by alleging that Modification has happened to the Delhi administration.Alleging that the remote control of the L-G was with the Delhi BJP, Mr. Kejriwal said Mr. Jung was not taking decisions independently and he was trying to save his chair."

With monsoon being below normal, there is a fear that price situation, especially food inflation, may further deteriorate in the coming days. Monsoon deficiency stood at 23 per cent in at the end of July.State Bank of India (SBI) Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya said the RBI is likely to keep interest rate intact in the monetary policy review. ""I think status quo (in policy rate) is more likely,"" she said.However, there are expectations that there could be some announcement in term of liquidity enhancement.""There may not be any action on interest rate front but there could be some action which will induce additional liquidity into the system,"" Oriental Bank of Commerce Chairman and Managing Director S L Bansal said.HDFC Bank Deputy Managing Director Paresh Sukthankar said: ""Our view is that policy rates are likely to remain roughly stable.""He further said: At least, the assumption that we are built in to for the GDP growth in this year, we are counting on major tail winds from interest rate reduction. The pick-up in the economy that we are anticipating is really going to be driven more by the policy environment and the investments picking up but not necessarily on the back of lower interest rates.""According to Indian Overseas Bank, interest rates will remain same in this policy, but going forward there would be a downward bias.In the last policy review in June, RBI chose not to tinker with the policy rate. It was the second consecutive time that RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan kept interest rates unchanged.The repo rate, at which the RBI lends to banks, was retained at 8 per cent and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was kept unchanged at 4 per cent.The statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), the mandatory amount of bonds lenders must park at the RBI, was cut by 0.5 per cent to 22.5 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) with effect from June 14.Bank of America-Merill Lynch said it expects the rate cut to happen only in December, if the monsoon normalises to cool down inflation, or early 2015 in case prices rise prolongs.""We continue to expect the Governor to be on hold on August 5...the RBI will be on long hold till it is clear that inflation is truly coming off,"" it said.""The RBI is likely to leave rates unchanged despite easing inflation... no hurry to ease rates,"" DBS said. It said the macroeconomic backdrop is looking better on most counts since the last monetary policy review in June and specifically mentioned a stability in the industrial growth saying it is only expected to consolidate over the next few quarters.However, the industry is pitching for a rate cut to boost industrial activities. Exhibiting signs of revival, India's manufacturing activity, gauged by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), had risen to 19-month high of 4.7 per cent in May on account of improved output from mining, power and capital goods sector.Besides improved industrial activity, retail inflation fell to a 30-month low of 7.31 per cent in June as prices of food items, including vegetables, came down. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation in June fell to 5.43 per cent after rising to a five-month high in the previous month.Committed to keeping the economy on a disinflationary course, considering CPI inflation at 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016, RBI said that further policy tightening will not be warranted if the economy stays on this course.""On the other hand, if disinflation, adjusting for base effects, is faster than currently anticipated, it will provide headroom for an easing of the policy stance,"" it had said."

While rising tomato prices have been making headlines over the past fortnight, the rates of other green vegetables are also showing an upward trend.A sharp rise in the prices of vegetables like tomato, onion, potato and cauliflower has adversely impacted household budgets.While ginger, an ingredient that adds the right dash of flavour to a dish, has been ruling at around Rs.200 per kg for a long time now, coriander that adds the perfect aroma has been hovering at Rs.150 per kg. Cauliflower and peas are being sold between Rs.40 and Rs.80 in the citys wholesale markets and for Rs.60 to Rs.120 in the retail market, depending on the quality.The traders blame the vagaries of monsoon and also their subsidiary expenditure for the spiralling cost.Traders at wholesale mandis attribute the price rise to lack of supply from the neighbouring States.Green vegetables like cauliflower arrive at the mandi largely from Haryana and neighbouring districts of Uttar Pradesh. However, supply from these traditional supply areas has stopped. This happens every year during this season. There has been a sudden increase in the prices of cauliflower now as fields in the surrounding States have been submerged due to the rain. The supply at this stage is only from Himachal Pradesh. The recent rain has played spoilsport, said Azadpur Mandi trader Suresh Mukhiya. Supply of other greens has also been affected.Traders said the retailers are forced to sell the produce at a premium as they have to pay commission to the mandi management, apart from paying the transportation cost.We need to pay transportation cost at two stages. Apart from paying the local transporter for carrying the load to the vehicles, we incur extra cost for transporting it to our retail shop. A margin of Rs.10 to Rs.15 over the wholesale rate is unavoidable, said Suresh Kumar, a vegetable seller at Sultanpuri, who was at the Azadpur Mandi for purchase.While prices of tomatoes continue to remain high in the wholesale market, onion prices have stabilised over the past few days. Tomato supply continues to remain restricted to just two States  Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka.Tomato supply has not normalised yet. Even supply from Himachal has been hit due to the recent rain. However, supply of onion has stabilised as daily arrival has been adequate. On Monday, 120 onion trucks arrived at the mandi , said Azadpur Mandi trader Sikander.(With inputs from interns Vinamrata and Richa Pandey)The one saving grace for many households is that in the fluctuating and volatile vegetable market, the onion prices have stabilised over the past few days and the daily arrivals have been adequate"

Although retail and wholesale markets across the city have started stabilizing, traders feel that prices will increase after the elections get over.Even a few months ago, markets across Kolkata have been facing a steep hike in vegetable prices. ""But it seems to have moderated a little now,"" said Kamal Banerjee, a trader in New Market.""Prices have come down in the wholesale markets in the last couple of weeks. Naturally, retail prices have also come down giving respite to consumers,"" he said.""Apart from potato, prices of all other vegetables have come down gradually in the last 15-20 days. In fact, we haven't seen so much supply of vegetables in the last one year,"" said Uttam Mukherjee, chief supervisor of Koley market, one of the largest wholesale vegetable markets in the state.""Except for potato prices, prices of all other vegetables have come down,"" he said. Prices of onion at the wholesale market have gradually come down from Rs 50 per kg some months ago to Rs 12-15per kg at present.""What has helped the state so far is a steady supply of locally grown onion. Production of onion in Bankura and Purulia earlier last year has helped in keeping prices low,"" he said. Similarly, prices of other vegetables like wax gourd (patal), lady's finger (dharos), brinjal, and cucumber have come down.""Prices of Jyoti variety of potato have increased from Rs 350 per 50 kg bag in March to Rs 550 kg now. This might come down after the new crop stored in cold storages is released in the market,"" said Gurupada Sinha, a trader in Posta potato market.Mangalmay Haldar has been selling vegetables at the Lake Market for more than 15 years.""Customers are happy about the prices and the quality as well. We had a good supply of vegetables so far. But it might go up again in a month,"" he said.Meanwhile, India's inflation rate has dropped to its lowest level in nine months. The inflation rate has dropped from 7.5% in November. But is this a prelude to elections scheduled a few days ahead?""No political party wants price rise to become an issue before elections. You have to make your own analysis from the fact. Moreover, there has been a good harvest so far,"" said Kamal Banerjee of New Market.Prices of commodities like wheat (atta) and a few varieties of rice have also come down marginally. Urad dal has marginally become cheaper in the last two months. Similarly, prices of atta, suji and 'Govind Bhog' rice have also declined in Posta bazar, the largest wholesale market in the state.While prices of fish have not come down, there has been a decline in prices of eggs. Egg prices at Sealdah market have come down from Rs 350-375 per 100 pcs two months ago to Rs 275-290 at present.""The purchasing power of the middle class and lower middle class has gradually come down over the last one year.

He was speaking to media representatives at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur, on Tuesday.The very purpose of constituting the Agricultural Prices Commission was to safeguard the interests of the farmers from these fluctuations. The commission will comprehend the cost of production incurred on cultivation along with natural factors and fix rational and scientific price for each agricultural produce, he said.He said that the commission would keep a watch on 12 produces including paddy, cotton, jowar, maize, red gram, groundnut, tomato, onion and potato that often face severe price drop every year. The commission will undertake region-wise crop survey and collect information from farmers about the cost incurred on cultivation before fixing the price, he said.Hanumanagowda Belagurki, another member of the commission, expressed concerned over people withdrawing from the agriculture sector.Lack of awareness among farmers about the latest developments in agriculture sector, their hesitation to use the advanced techniques in farming, increased cost of cultivation and uncertain prices in the market are pushing farmers out of the sector. The commission will strive to infuse confidence among the farming community by fixing scientific prices for their crops, he said."
192,Twin push to potato price,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140808/jsp/odisha/story_18698000.jsp,2014-08-08,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, Aug. 7: Potato has become scarce in the wake of floods with rates soaring to Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg from Rs 20 a week ago. What has compounded the crisis is almost no supply from Bengal and hoarding. The city needs 500 to 700 tonnes of potato daily and the requirement is met with 30 to 40 truckloads of the produce coming from Bengal. But not a single truck from the neighbouring state has arrived here in the last three days. Yesterday only six truckloads of potatoes reached here from a godown in Cuttack. This was like a drop in an ocean of requirement. When the state is facing such a crisis, we get to know that Punjab farmers having exported a major chunk of their produce to Pakistan. Therefore, the state is trying to tide over the trouble with potatoes from Bengal. But even that is not happening as the Bengal Government wants to levy an additional 10 per cent tax on potato consignments. Since a decision on this is still pending, there is no movement of the trucks from Sonakonia check post on the Bengal-Odisha border, said Sudhakar Panda, working president of Kuberpuri Byabasayi Sangh, Ainginia, on city outskirts. Pitambar Parida, who buys vegetable from Unit I Daily Market, was surprised to find that potato had vanished from the market. Last night I heard that the prices have risen to Rs 30 a kg, so I came here in the hope of buying some. But there is no trace of the tuber here, he said. Jasaswini Mohapatra, a housemaker from Soubhagya Nagar (Phase II), said the rise in the price of potato is unacceptable at a time when the state is in the grip of floods. The government should take immediate steps to resolve the crisis, she said. Civil supplies secretary Madhusudan Padhi said: The state government has initiated the process of talks with the Bengal government as it was found that potato laden-trucks from the neighbouring state were asked to stop at the border. On the other hand, the state government today requested the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) to supply 3,000 quintals of potato to Odisha in the first phase. Potato consignments will take minimum three to four days to arrive here as they will come from the Nafed godowns in Kanpur, said a senior official of the Civil Supplies Department.  The state government has decided to sell potatoes at market price at PDS and Maitree stores, the official said. Panda, who is also the general secretary of All Odisha Byabasayi Sangh, said: Last year after Phailin, our organisation had suggested that all the 18 cold storages of the state government should be made functional so that potato farmers can use them and store nearly 2 lakh tonnes of tuber that can sustain us for two months, but nothing has happened so far. A senior official of the civil supplies department, who spoke on conditions of anonymity, said: For the last five years we are suggesting that farmers should be allowed to use cold storages across the state at a concessional tariff, but there is no response. Professor of plant breeding and an expert associated with the All India Coordinated Research Project on Potato at the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology P.C. Satpathy said: With better use of irrigation facility in areas having cooler climate, we can produce more potato but we need modern storage facilities. Odisha produces 1.98 lakh tones of potatoes, but consumes more than nine tonnes. The rest of the supply comes from Bengal. State horticulture directorate claims that actual production in Odisha was 2.5 lakh tonnes if monsoon production in cool climatic regions such as Koraput and Phulbani is taken into consideration. However, the bulk of this produce gets diverted to the neighbouring states for want of enough storage space in Odisha."

194,"State intervenes again, potato price soars",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140808/jsp/bengal/story_18699613.jsp,2014-08-08,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Aug. 7: The Bengal governments intervention in the potato market has raised fears of a replay of last years cycle in which prices soared when traders reportedly controlled the supply within the state after they were prevented from sending stocks outside. The price of the Jyoti variety of potato has already hit Rs 22 a kilo in some Calcutta markets. Last week, the state government had barred the transportation of potato to other states. From Rs 17-18 a kilo on July 28  the day the export ban was announced  the price has risen to Rs 22 within a week. The price is rising in spite of projections that Bengal could end up with a surplus stock of around 6 lakh tonnes by December-end when fresh stocks arrive. According to officials, many traders depend on sales to other states since potato is usually in surplus in Bengal. However, hit by the ban on exports, the traders could be regulating the supply within the state to make good their loss, the officials said. Any squeeze on the supply will tell on the prices. In October last year, the Bengal government had fixed the price of potato at Rs 13 a kilo and stopped export to others states, following which the price went up to Rs 18 a kilo. It appears that exactly the same thing is happening now, said an official. A member of the West Bengal Cold Storage Association appeared to corroborate the surmise. Every week, the state requires 1.25 lakh tonnes of potato. But since the traders were barred from taking potato out of the state, about 80,000 tonnes of potato is being released from the stores in a week, the association member said. The seeds of the current problem appear to lie in Uttar Pradesh, which exported a huge quantity to Pakistan. This left an impact in supply of potato to other states, which hiked the demand of potato from Bengal. This continued for a week or so and a few thousand tonnes were sent to other states. Although no potato is being sent to other states now, the price of the commodity is increasing in Bengal markets, said an official. Such situations have to be handled with extreme sensitivity as any sign of government intervention will encourage traders to sit on stocks in the hope of higher prices. But the announcement of the export ban without adequate homework carries risks. The government did not calculate what stock we have in our cold storages right now . We have 31 lakh tonnes of potato in cold storages across the state and we would require around 25 lakh tonnes to meet the states consumption requirement till December 31, when the fresh stock arrives in the market, an official said. The official added that the state would have a surplus of six lakh tonnes of potato by the year-end. If the surplus produce is not sent to other states, farmers and traders will suffer heavily, he added. The government appears to be banking on policing methods to tackle the problem. The officials said the government had decided to stop transportation of potato to other states. Trucks that will be caught ferrying potato to other states will be seized and the tuber will be sold at government outlets in Calcuttas markets at Rs 14 a kilo, the price mentioned in a government advisory to traders. Since last night, police have stopped around 30 trucks on the Bengal-Odisha border near Digha. Senior officials said the steps initiated by the government could make the situation more critical and cited last years example. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee today pulled up members of the task force set up to keep a check on prices of essential commodities. Mamata convened a special meeting of the task force  represented by senior officials from the agriculture, agri-marketing and food and supplies departments, the enforcement branch and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation  today to express her concern about the soaring potato price. She was furious after coming to know that potato was being sold in Calcuttas markets at Rs 22 a kilo despite the governments advisory. All the task force officials faced her wrath. The chief minister feels that the task force failed to stop the transportation of potato to other states, an official present at the meeting said."

The motion of this vibration creates a very subtle visual signal thats usually invisible to the naked eye. People didnt realise that this information was there. By analysing highspeed video of a potted plant, for instance, Davis and the rest of the team were able to extract the recording of Mary Had a Little Lamb which was played alongside it.In another experiment, they were able to recreate the voice of a human reading the lyrics to the song from video of a crisp packet filmed through a glass door.As well as the obvious applications for surveillance and law enforcement, Davis plans on seeing whether the acoustic properties of objects reveal more information about their internal make up, calling it a new kind of imaging.Were recovering sounds from objects, he says. That gives us a lot of information about the sound thats going on around the object, but it also gives us a lot of information about the object itself, because different objects are going to respond to sound in different ways. Typically, the algorithm that allows them to extract this information requires a camera that records very highspeed video; the frequency of audible sound (the number of vibrations every second) ranges from 20 to 20,000 Hz, and a sound can only be extracted by a camera with a frame rate higher than the frequency itself.Conventional cameras, with a frame rate of just 60 frames per second, cannot be used to extract anything more than extremely lowfrequency sounds.But the researchers came up with a second technique, using the rolling shutter typical on digital video cameras, to extract enough information from the video to still recreate highfrequency audio.Because such cameras dont save the whole image in one go, but rather record the video linebyline, far more data can be extracted from it. A simple digital SLR camera, shooting video of a crisp packet at 60fps, can then be used to recreate the audio being played to that packet.Alexei Efros, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, praised the work of the group as new and refreshing.Were scientists, and sometimes we watch these movies, like James Bond, and we think, This is Hollywood theatrics. Its not possible to do that. This is ridiculous. And suddenly, there you have it. This is totally out of some Hollywood thriller. You know that the killer has admitted his guilt because theres surveillance footage of his potato chip bag vibrating. The full paper will be presented at computer graphics conference Siggraph later this week.Copyright: Guardian News & Media 2014"

(Hardeep Singh) Aloo mein phir se aag lag gaya, Ranchis Kutchery market vendor Birendra Sao thought aloud on Thursday afternoon as the Bengal ban on the staple tuberous crop had its ripple effect across vegetable mandis and kitchens. As prices took a leap from Rs 18-20 to Rs 24-26 a kg in most parts of the state, including the capital and Jamshedpur, the humble potato vanished from the lunch plate in many homes, and the abrupt crisis prompted agriculture department mandarins to mull a missive for Mamata Banerjee. Sao said they were already selling potatoes at Rs 25 a kg and the ban imposed on transportation of the crop outside Bengal by the neighbouring Trinamul Congress government would jack up the rate to Rs 30 per kg very soon. In Ranchi, we used to pay Rs 700 for one sack, which contains around 50kg of aloo. Now, the same is selling at Rs 1,100. Also, at least 2-3kg comes rotten. How can we afford to give customers a better rate? the retailer said. Shankar Lal, a wholesale trader of potato, onion and garlic from Chaibasa in West Singhbhum, echoed Sao and said that stocks were fast depleting and the potato crisis would only deepen if Bengal did not lift the ban or at least allow a restricted flow of the vegetable to Jharkhand. Jharkhand should stop supply of green vegetables to Bengal if the Mamata Banerjee government does not mend its ways, he said. In Jamshedpur, wholesalers apprehend that the tuber will go poof from markets as early as Friday. The price of potato has leaped 20 per cent in a day from Rs 22 to Rs 26 a kg, said a wholesaler, who was part of a poster-armed group at Bistupur market raising anti-Mamata Banerjee slogans. Yeh koi tarika hai jo Mamata Banerjee ne apnaya hai. Rajyon ki aapsi vyapaar se hi desh chalta hai. Lekin Bangal sarkar ne aloo rajya ke bahar le jane par rok laga diya (What kind of a ridiculous stance has Mamata Banerjee adopted. Trade among states helps runs a country. And here, the Bengal government has banned transportation of potatoes), said Ganesh Shah, another wholesaler. Shah added that the potato trade had been hit for the past fortnight, but they still managed to sneak in trucks by greasing the palm of border police in Barsole and Chakulia. But today (Thursday), not a single truck has crossed the border. Around 19-20 are stranded since Tuesday and police are not relenting even for money we can afford to offer, he told The Telegraph. According to wholesalers, each truck brings in 10 tonnes of potatoes in 240 bags. We buy one bag for Rs 900 and sell the same for Rs 1,300. We have to pay Rs 30,000 as bribe per truck at the border. This is added to the price of potatoes. So, what sold at Rs 16 a kg increased to Rs 22 and now to Rs 26, Shah explained. My kitchen budget has been hit. I have stopped making aloo subzi. If the price of potato continues to soar, I will perhaps have to rethink before adding aloo as an ingredient to other dishes, said Priti Singh, a homemaker in Bistupur. Krishi Utpad Samiti secretary Ashok Kumar Sinha confirmed the crisis and said storing potatoes was not an option. There are no adequate storage facilities, he said. Located in suburban Parsudih, the Samiti is the main trading centre where consignments are offloaded. State agriculture department secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni said there had been no communiqu from Bengal about any restriction or ban on the entry of potatoes from the neighbouring state, from where the tuber reaches different mandis of Jharkhand. However, I plan to write to my Bengal counterpart today, giving details of problems faced by the people of our state, Kulkarni said, adding that they were assessing the situation and trying to find a way out."
197,Potato haves and have-nots,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140809/jsp/bengal/story_18703610.jsp,2014-08-09,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Aug. 8: Critics of the Bengal governments potato intervention policy have pointed to a curious detail to claim the drive smacks of tokenism. The government has opened outlets to sell potato at prices far lower than the market rate (see chart). But all the 27 centres are located in urban areas such as Calcutta, Salt Lake and Howrah. There is no clarity yet on whether such subsidised stalls will be opened elsewhere in the state too. Income levels are relatively higher in urban areas than those in rural belts, and the more needy would be found in villages, not in the city and its outskirts, officials said. However, if the scheme is widened across the state, the government may fall short of affordable stocks that are now largely sourced from seized trucks and cold storage units that are at the mercy of the administration, the officials said. The government is buying potato directly from cold storages and seizing stocks from trucks transporting the commodity to other states in violation of a directive. Senior officials said around 70 trucks have been stopped near the Odisha border since last night and the seized potato is being brought to Calcutta so that the counters dont run out of stock. The sellers will buy the potato from the government at Rs 12 a kilo and sell them to consumers at Rs 14 a kilo. The government will pay the owners of the seized potato Rs 12 a kilo, a Nabanna official said. The government has stopped the transportation of potato to other states and issued an advisory to sell the tuber at Rs 14 a kilo after the price rose to Rs 22 a kilo in Calcutta and Rs 20 a kilo in the districts. Several officials said that once the government decided to intervene  which itself has added fuel to the price fire  the districts should have been given higher priority than the city. According to Planning Commission figures, 22.52 per cent of Bengals rural population fell below the poverty line. The figure is 14.66 per cent in urban areas. The potato policy makes it seem like all the poor people live in Calcutta or its surrounding areas. I cant understand the governments logic behind selling potato at subsidised rates only in Calcutta, an official said. The people in the districts need subsidised potato more than those in the city. A minister said the government would sell subsidised potato in the districts, too. But an agricultural department official said it was not possible for the government to sell potato at Rs 14 a kilo across the state. The government does not harvest potato, so it does not have a stock of its own. The agriculture-marketing and horticulture departments are putting pressure on the West Bengal Cold Storage Association to give the government potato at Rs 13.30 a kilo. This potato is being sold at Rs 14 a kilo at the city counters. According to estimates, the association is giving 100 tonnes of potato every week to the two departments at Rs 13.30 a kilo although the price of the tuber is Rs 18 a kilo at the cold storages. As cold storage owners have to renew their licence every year, seek subsidy on electricity bills and request extension of deadlines to keep stock, they feel compelled to sell the potato to the government at a cheaper rate. They can still afford to do so as the demand is around 100 tonnes a week now. If the demand goes up, the storage owners will not be able to supply at such a low rate, another official said."
198,"Trucks detained, potato price soars",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140809/jsp/odisha/story_18702122.jsp,2014-08-09,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, Aug. 8: Non-availability of potato continues to push up its price in local markets. While one kilogram of potato was being sold at Rs 20 or less a few days ago, it has now touched Rs 40 in city markets. On the outskirts, potato is being sold for Rs 50. The shortage has been triggered due to restriction on dispatch of potato from neighbouring Bengal, which meets bulk of Odisha's requirement. State food supplies secretary Madhusudan Padhi, however, said that he had spoken to his Bengal counterpart, who assured him that no official restriction had been imposed on supply of potato by the Mamata Banerjee government. Padhis comment, however, is in sharp contrast to the scenario at the Odisha border where around 270 potato-laden trucks have been detained by the Bengal police. In Calcutta, a minister in the Mamata Banerjee government told The Telegraph that there was no change in stance. The Bengal government will not allow any trader to transport potato outside the state, he said. We are implementing a provision of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. As per the provision, the state can prevent essential items going out from its jurisdiction in case of a crisis. Bengal is facing a crisis due to the rising prices of potato and thats why we cannot allow its export to other states before the festive season, the minister said. Asked if other states oppose the move and lodge complaints with the Centre, the minister said: The Centre can talk to us We will tell them why we had to initiate the step, but we are not accountable to other states. Secretary of the All Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said that the situation might continue unless the Bengal government releases the detained trucks. Last evening 10 truckloads of potato, around 160 tonnes, arrived in the city. But it was inadequate as the daily requirement crosses 300 trucks. However, after the release of potato from the cold storages, the price has come down to some extent, said Panda. Padhi said around 300 metric tonnes of potatoes had been stored in two cold storages. This stock would be sold at Rs 20 per kg through 50 public distribution system outlets and five fair price shops of the government. The memory of last year when potato vanished from the market is still fresh in our mind. But luckily it could buy it today, said Surabhi Nanda, a homemaker. Traders say that the state government should intervene fast or potatoes in the detained trucks would perish. They also fear that production may get affected because of the flood in the vegetable production centres such as Banki, Balianta and Kakatpur. To tide over the crisis, food supplies minister Sanjay Kumar Das Burma said: We are trying to sustain on the reserve stock. Besides we are trying to procure potato from other states. We are also trying to procure potato through Nafed. The crisis has already begun to take political hues as BJD leaders and workers stopped hundreds of Bengal-bound trucks carrying edible goods near the Laxmannath check gate in Balasore. They were protesting against the Bengal governments decision not to let potato-filled trucks into Odisha. Balasores sub-divisional police officer Satya Ranjan Mallick said: The protesters are only allowing vehicles carrying non-edible items. District collector Arabind Agarwal said: I have spoken to my counterpart in Bengal and have also informed the state government. Most of the Bengal-bound trucks have consignments of perishable items such as fish, eggs, fruits and tomatoes from either Andhra Pradesh or Odisha. BJD MLA Aswani Patra said: The picketing is in protest against the Bengal governments unilateral decision to stop sending potato to us. Echoing similar sentiments, Balasore MP R.K. Jena said: There should be no restriction between two states. We are all inter-dependant."

The stress is likely to increase if the ensuing monsoon is sub-normal and drive up prices of other vegetables.It would, therefore, be useful if the district officers could be advised to prevent hoarding of potato and onions and keep a tab on their stocks in cold stores. Letters also advised the State government to explore possibility of advising the State Marketing board and civil supplies cooperation to build strategic reserve of onions and potatoes to tide over the next few months."

After this the potato prices in the State started increasing and the staple vegetable is currently being sold at over Rs. 20 per kg.At the meeting, West Bengal Trades Association secretary Rabindranath Koley told Mr. Ahmed that it is not possible for them to sell potato at the regulated price. Vegetable traders buy potato from wholesalers at the price of Rs. 16 to Rs. 17 per kg. Then how is it possible for them to sell it at Rs. 14 per kg? said Mr. Koley.Mr. Ahmed pointed out that the State governments directive to sell potato at Rs. 14 per kg is yet to be implemented and for the time being the traders may sell potato at the current market price.Recently, the State government has imposed a ban on sending potatoes to other States in a bid to tackle the rise in prices.

203,Potato quota scrap fuels price rise,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140810/jsp/bengal/story_18706354.jsp,2014-08-10,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Aug. 9: The Mamata Banerjee governments decision to scrap the space quota of farmers at cold storages has contributed to the rise in potato prices, a section of officials said today. Earlier this year, the government had replaced the old quota system, under which 40 per cent of the space of a cold storage was reserved for farmers, with a first-come-first-served policy. The officials said the new system was helping traders, who buy potato from farmers, rig prices by manipulating supplies. We have come to know that only about 85,000 tonnes of potatoes have been released to the market in the past one week while the consumption requirement is 1.25 lakh tonnes. We are certain that the cold storages have at least 31 lakh tonnes of potatoes. This means there is no real shortage, an official said. The officials said the stock in the cold storages was much more than the requirement of around 25 lakh tonnes till December, when the new crop will arrive. They accused the traders of creating an artificial shortage. Under the previous system, the cold storage owners had to set aside 40 per cent of the space for small and marginal farmers. Of the remaining 60 per cent, 10 per cent space was reserved for the zilla parishad and the district magistrate and 50 per cent for whoever else wanted to store stock. The entire quota system has been abolished. A member of the West Bengal Cold Storage Association said that had farmers been allowed to store a considerable portion of their produce, the supply chain would not have been affected. Farmers reinvest the money earned from the sale of the tuber in cultivation in monsoon (July-August) and winter (October-December). So they bring their stock to the market during these two periods, when the price of potato goes up following an increase in demand because of several factors. According to the cold storage owner, the abolition of the quota had allowed traders  who have more stock available with them than farmers  to book more space in cold storages. He said traders were reasonably better off and knew how to manipulate the system to earn higher returns, adding that this was one of the main reasons for the rise in potato prices. Potato is now selling at Rs 22 a kilo in Calcutta markets and Rs 20 a kilo in the districts."

205,A failed recipe in India's food inflation fight,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/424674/a-failed-recipe-indias-food.html,2014-08-10,Deccan Herald,"A failed recipe in India's food inflation fightRajesh Kumar Singh and Mayank Bhardwaj, AUg 11, 2014, Reuters: 21:07 ISTIt's been more than a month since Nirmala bought fresh tomatoes. A fourfold rise in prices since early June has made the essential ingredient in Indian curries and sauces a luxury she can no longer afford.Buying tomatoes feels like buying jewellery, says the 29-year-old maid, who is struggling to make ends meet on her monthly pay of $165 as prices for fresh staples such as onions and potatoes also soar in New Delhi.Prime Minister Narendra Modis election triumph in May had raised hopes of quick action to tackle India's recurring food price shocks. But, despite his strong economic record of running Gujarat, he has resorted to an old inflation playbook that contributed to the last government's crashing defeat.Just like his predecessor, Modi has imposed export curbs and cracked down on hoarding. While these steps can give brief relief, they cannot fix a dilapidated system controlled by middlemen.So far, the cash-strapped government has committed to invest less than one-tenth of the amount it estimates is needed to fix India's cold supply chain. It opposes the entry of foreign supermarket giants who might set up their own logistics.Its only innovation, a food price stabilisation fund, is at $82 million derided as too tiny to make any difference in feeding the country's 1.2 billion people.Economists who had backed Modi to put Asia's third largest economy back on track are already expressing unease at the government's failure to lay out a credible inflation strategy, beyond short-term improvisation.Modi's approach is that of a district collector rather than a structural reformer, said Rajiv Kumar, a senior fellow at the privately-funded Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. The reference is to Indias army of low-level officials whose role - dating to British colonial rule - includes being a local tax man and administrator.This is my fear about this government - that it is being captured by the bureaucrats, Kumar says. Competition is the best short-term guarantee to reduce prices.Chronic shortageOfficials privately concede that inward investment in multi-brand retail would help revamp an archaic distribution system that forces farmers to sell at regulated markets where middlemen command hefty markups. India is the world's second-biggest producer of fruit and vegetables after China, but it battles chronic shortages as an estimated 18 per cent of the crop goes waste every year due to inadequate cold storage and refrigerated transport facilities.New Delhi estimates it needs to invest $9 billion in the cold supply chain by March 2016 to handle growing output of fruit and vegetables. That is more than 10 times the $822 million allocated in Modi's maiden budget last month, and far more than the government can afford.The South Asian nation has 6,300 cold storage facilities with capacity of 30 million tonnes, barely half its needs, the National Horticulture Board estimates.Annual retail inflation has averaged about 9.5 percent since January 2012, when the government started its latest data series. In the same time, vegetables have gone up by 64 percent.Last year, it was onion; this year, it is tomatoes; next year, it will be something else, says Nirmala. Every year the story remains the same.Onion prices surged last year as high as $1.60 a kilogramme, making them more expensive in India than in the United States, where incomes are roughly 35 times higher.Economists say curbing runaway food prices will be vital if India is to achieve a broader revival from a two-year-old slowdown in growth.Food bills devour 35 percent of household incomes, sapping appetites for discretionary spending. Prices for fresh produce also are causing indigestion at India's central bank, which wants to reduce retail inflation to 6 per cent by 2016. The Reserve Bank of India held rates on Tuesday, citing the risk that inflation could get higher due to weak monsoon rains needed for summer crops to grow.Abhijit Sen, an adviser to the last government, says only a combination of more cold stores and better mobility of food stocks can solve the problem. But ramping up investments will be a challenge due to stretched government finances.That's the situation which this government faces as much as the previous government, Sen said.A senior official in the Modi administration defended its inflation approach, saying prices would have risen even more quickly if the government had not taken prompt action as recent extreme heat and dry weather stoked food supply fears.We all know the long-term solutions, but they will not solve the problem overnight, he said. At the moment, administrative measures are the only recourse."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 11: Barely 24 hours after food and supplies minister Sanjay Dasbarma claimed that potato crisis was over following talks between chief minister Naveen Patnaik and his Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee, shortage of the tuber is back to haunt consumers. The minister today claimed that the neighbouring state government had imposed an undeclared ban on the supply of potato to Odisha and several truckloads of the vegetable were stranded on the border. Around 90 trucks of potatoes have come to the state in the last three days. Officials said that yesterday only four trucks had entered the state from Bengal following a telephonic conversation between the two chief ministers. The committee tasked with evolving a contingency plan to prevent recurrence of such crises today held a meeting under the chairmanship of Dasbarma. He said that even the traders in Bengal were not happy with their government decision and had started an agitation complaining that they were incurring heavy losses due to the restrictions. We are waiting for the outcome of their agitation and hope that the deadlock will be resolved, he said. Dasbarma also said there was enough stock of potato in the cold storages and his department would provide those to the people at reasonable rates. While 32,000 quintal potato is available in Bhubaneswar, 34,800 quintal in available in Cuttack and 20,000 quintal in Balasore. We will keep selling potato at our control shops, fair price centres and Udyan Fresh counters at the usual Rs 20 per kg with maximum two kg per person, he said. However, all eyes are on Balasore that borders Bengal and serves as the entry point for the goods coming from the neighbouring state. Officials of food and supply department, district police and transport department are on vigil in Balasore. Balasore collector Aravinda Agrawal said that he spoke to his East Midnapore counterpart and was told that he had no instruction to allow trucks into Odisha. More than 200 potato-loaded trucks are stranded on the Bengal side. Yesterday few trucks drove in from Bengal through the Laxmannath gate and today the count was around 40. These vehicles crossed the border through different routes. We are periodically updating the government about the development here, said Agrawal. Besides, BJD activists who had detaining Bengal-bound trucks carrying food items in retaliation to the ban on supply of potato from the neighbouring state have threatened to resume the agitation. The rate of potato, however, has dropped a bit than the last few days. Apprehensive that the price might rise again, people were seen buying potato in large quantities in city markets. Bhubaneswar traders said that today three trucks reached the state and these vehicles came through Jharkhand. We want the state government to raise this issue in Parliament as it is an inter-state trade matter, said Sudhakar Panda, secretary of All Odisha Byabasayi Mahasangha. In another development, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy said that the current potato crisis in the state had arisen due to lack of enough cold storage and the government had taken the matter seriously. We are going to set up around 15 such storage facilities across the state. Besides, one such cold storage each will be inaugurated at Panikoili and Titlagarh in the state within one month, said the agriculture minister."

There is no information on Netajis death and the Supreme Court also could not ascertain this. The matter was ultimately dropped, Mr. Bose said.The States Left Front has been repeatedly demanding that January 23  Netajis birthday  be declared Deshprem Divas, which has fallen on deaf ears, he said.

We have invited all the allies of the Left Front to walk along with us and fight for a common cause on September 1 and pray for peace in Gaza, Mr. Bose said.Asked whether the Left would be joining hands with the Congress for the peace march, he said the Congress had entered into a pact and was buying arms from Israel.Criticising the State government for failing to control the price hike, he said, The State produces more potatoes than it consumes yet the State government has failed to control the price hike."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 12: The state will require at least two days to overcome potato shortage as the tuber brought through the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Limited (Nafed) is not expected to reach here before Thursday. The food and supply department has been forced to procure potatoes through Nafed with the Bengal government not showing any sign of withdrawing its undeclared ban on its supply to Odisha. People here are apprehensive that potato may not be available in the market after a few days. However, both the state government and traders have sought to assure consumers that there was no reason for panic. The state government has been providing potato through its fair price shops at reasonable rates while the traders are now depending on the few truckloads coming to the city through other routes. We have heard that very few truckloads of potatoes are coming to the state. So, we are planning to purchase it in bulk, said Tapas Panda, a resident of Baramunda. Madhusudan Padhee, secretary of the food and supply department, said potato bought through Nafed would reach the state on Thursday. We have ordered 3,040 quintals of potatoes and Nafed would procure it from Kanpur. Once it comes to the market, the situation will become normal, said Padhee. The Bengal government has not lifted its undeclared ban on supply of potato to Odisha despite traders in the neighbouring state staging protests against the governments decision. Food and civil supplies minister Sanjay Das Burma today met the chief minister and informed him about the situation. He said 80 trucks of potatoes have arrived in the state during the last 24 hours. We have enough stock in the state for now. The department has been procuring the tuber from there and providing it at Rs 20 a kg to people at fair prices centres. This will continue until the potato shortage ends, said Das Burma. He said the government had been trying to create pressure on the Bengal government to review its decision. Besides, the traders there have been protesting against their governments stand because they are incurring huge losses. The traders in Bhubaneswar said the state government should try to make it a national issue and raise the matter in Parliament. Sudhakar Panda, secretary of the Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha, said the situation was not normal in the state with the Bengal ban continuing. Today, there is a special task force committee meeting in Bengal regarding the ban on potato supply. As the traders there are protesting, the Bengal governments task force is going to take a decision in this regard. We are waiting for the decision of the meeting, said Panda. He added that while just four trucks of potatoes had reached Bhubaneswar yesterday, 14 trucks arrived today. Besides, around 70 trucks of potatoes have reached different parts of the state. As the Bengal police have been guarding the Laxmannath check gate on NH-60, these vehicles have come to Odisha through Jharkhand and other check gates on the border. The state has enough potatoes for now and we request people not to panic and indulge in huge purchases. The situation will be normal and people should refrain from bulk purchase as it will have an adverse effect on the market, he said."
213,Tuber lesson: Odisha mulls buffer stock,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140814/jsp/odisha/story_18719020.jsp,2014-08-14,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, Aug. 13: Having learnt a bitter lesson from the current potato crisis, the Odisha government today decided to maintain a buffer stock of the tuber from next year and sell it through the public distribution system (PDS) outlets to meet exigencies such as the present one. Food and civil supplies minister Sanjay Das Burma said the state government today decided to keep a buffer stock of four lakh quintals of potatoes during the lean period of August-December from next year. The present crisis arises out of potato shortage, mainly because Bengal government government imposed restrictions on movement of potato-laden trucks outside the state. The trucks were held up at the border and there was shortage of supply of the tuber in markets across the state. Odisha heavily depends on potato supply from neighbouring Bengal. Das Burma reiterated that the crisis arose because of an undeclared restriction imposed by the Bengal government on potato supply to Odisha. Agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy admitted that the state was heavily dependent on Bengal for its potato needs. The domestic production meets only one fourth of the states total requirement. We depend upon West Bengal for around nine months in a year, he said. The state produced 2.01 lakh metric tonnes of potatoes in 2012-13 as against the demand of 9.27 lakh metric tonnes. During the next year, potato production was 2.50 lakh metric tonnes against the requirement of 11 lakh metric tonnes, said the minister. Last year, the state had faced a severe crisis with potatoes selling at Rs 60 a kg in the retail market. This year too, the potato price ranges between Rs 24 and Rs 30 per kg following lack of supply in the market. The state-owned Odisha State Cooperative Marketing Federation (Markfed) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Fedeeation (Nafed) will procure potatoes from the market. This stock will be stored in 11 cold storages  six being run by the cooperation department and five by private entrepreneurs  and will be sold through PDS outlets and Maitree fair price shops, said Das Burma. Speaking on the present situation, the minister said there was adequate stock in the state to meet the crisis. During the last 24 hours, around 150 trucks from Bengal had entered the state, which would ease the situation. Till the situation stabilises, sale of potato at Rs 20 per kg through PDS outlets and fair price shops will continue, he said. The state government also constituted a taskforce to formulate a long-term action plan on potato cultivation, conservation and distribution. The taskforce, headed by agriculture secretary Rajesh Verma, will have secretaries of food supplies and consumer welfare and cooperation departments as members. It has been asked to submit its report within 30 days. Agriculture minister Maharathy said farmers were not keen on potato cultivation due to the absence of cold storages in the state. Our government has announced 75 per cent subsidy for the entrepreneurs who want to set up cold storages in undivided Koraput-Balangir-Koraput (KBK) districts and 60 per cent for those in the coastal areas. But the entrepreneurs are not keen as the cold storages are high electricity consuming units. I have discussed this issue with our chief minister and suggested that power tariff for the cold storages should be reduced, he said. Director, horticulture has been asked to submit an action plan for the revival of 12 cold storages under cooperation department, which are not in running condition at present."

215,"Under pressure, govt eases potato ban",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140814/jsp/bengal/story_18720094.jsp,2014-08-14,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Aug. 13: The Bengal government today allowed the sale of potato to two states for a week, partially lifting a ban that is being blamed for fuelling the rise in the price of the tuber. The Mamata Banerjee government said it allowed the transportation of potato to Odisha and Jharkhand in response to requests by the two states. Sources, however, said the Bengal government had been under pressure from potato traders, who have been suffering losses because of the export ban in place since July-end. As Bengal is a potato-surplus state, traders will suffer more losses if they dont clear the excess stock of around five lakh tonnes before the new crop enters cold storages in November. During a meeting at Nabanna today with the task force set up to monitor prices of essential commodities, the chief minister told representatives of potato traders that the government would partially lift the blanket ban on transportation for seven days. But the relaxation will be limited. Traders can send 5,000 tonnes of potatoes to Odisha every day between August 17 and 23, and 500 tonnes to Jharkhand every day during the same period. Strong vigil will be maintained during the transportation, said a minister who attended the meeting. The minister said the decision to lift the blanket ban was taken after Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik requested Mamata to send potatoes. The Jharkhand government had also made a similar request. As Odisha is battling floods, we have decided to send 35,000 tonnes of potatoes to the state. We cannot give much to Jharkhand even though we have lifted the ban partially, the minister added. Jharkhand buys almost its entire stock of potato from other states. A senior Bengal government official, however, said the government had given in to the demands of traders, who had been protesting the ban on the export of potato after a sudden rise in the price of the tuber. Within a week of the ban, imposed on July 27, the price of the Jyoti variety soared to Rs 22 a kilo in Calcutta and Rs 20 a kilo in the districts. Senior government officials had said that unhappy with the governments decision, potato traders had created a bottleneck in the supply chain, resulting in the price rise. The officials said the traders squeezed supply by bringing less potato to the market, which drove up prices. Although the administration tried to handle the situation by selling potato  largely sourced from stocks seized from trucks transporting the tuber to other states in violation of the ban and from cold storage owners who are at the mercy of the government  at Rs 14 a kilo at counters in select Calcutta markets, prices did not come down. It is clear that the government has surrendered to the potato traders by allowing them to sell stocks to other states. It has been proved that unless the traders bring more stocks out of cold storages, prices cannot be brought down, an official said. A section of traders, who have potato stocked in cold storages, said they were happy with the decision to partially lift the ban, but added that the government should consider a complete withdrawal. We have enough stocks . We have around 30 lakh tonnes of potato in cold storages. The states consumption requirement till December, when fresh stocks will arrive, is 25 lakh tonnes. We have around five lakh tonnes that have to be exported, said a representative of the West Bengal Progressive Potato Traders Association. The stocks have to be cleared before November, when the early variety of potato from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh starts coming to Bengal. If we cant send the potato to other states by end-October, we will suffer losses, a trader said."

The carbohydrate fare would come from truckloads of potatoes that the government had seized and kept at Milan Mela as part of its controversial crackdown to curb export of the tuber to other states. Sacks full of potatoes are currently rotting in rain at the fair ground. These are going to be pig food, said an official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). A part of the CMC slaughterhouse on Gobinda Khatik Road in Tangra will be turned into sty for the new arrivals. Pigs will be kept at an open yard of the Tangra slaughterhouse, said Atin Ghosh, the mayoral council (health). The CMC had captured over 240 pigs over the past fortnight and kept them at an open-air enclosure off Basanti Highway after stowing the animals in a garbage truck for a few days initially. As more and more pigs were being caught, the 10-cottah plot at Bantala near Dhapa has become overcrowded. Hence the need for a new home, the official said. The CMC had installed electric lights and fans, a series of mangers and mosquito nets covering the entire area. The net was necessary to prevent mosquitoes from biting the pigs and carrying the Japanese Encephalitis virus to humans. An employee has been assigned to provide food to the animals, the official said. The plot has been heavily fenced to stop the pigs from escaping into villages off the Basanti Highway. According to CMC officials, the city has about 3,000 pigs, many of which are unaccounted for. The space at Tangra is nearly twice the size of the one at Bantala. This is a vacant and enclosed place, suited for our purpose. We will have to put lights and fans and cover the yard with mosquito nets. Since this is within the city, we have to be more careful, an official said. Their stay taken care of, the animals can now expect their choicest food. In fact, there was a mutiny of sorts at Bantala as the pigs penned there refused to eat the ration supplied by the animal resource department. They put the CMC in a spot. Officials had to contact hotels off the Bypass and get a supply of leftovers. They are happy with crumbs! a source said. From crumbs to nutritious spud, the pigs can expect a delectable dietary change very soon. Trucks carrying produce from this years bumper potato harvest in the state had been seized in East Midnapore, West Midnapore and Bankura after the government decided to ban export of the tuber to other states in a knee-jerk reaction to prices shooting up last week. The government wants potatoes to be sold at Rs 14 a kilo in the state, at a time the vegetable is fetching much more than that in other states. The potatoes are rotting in heat and moisture. The rotten potatoes are being separated from the good ones. They spoilt spuds will be transported to Bantala for the pigs, a CMC official said."

""In contrast to the acceleration seen in the July CPI data to 8% from 7.5%, the WPI eased to 5.2% from 5.4% last month.

The prices of potato, which were around Rs 10 per kg till March-end this year, have trebled to Rs 30 a kg in the Rythu bazaars and quadrupled to Rs 40 a kg in the open market due to short supply of the ubiquitous vegetable, said rythu bazaar officials.And while consumers blame it on the inability of the government to control prices, agricultural marketing department officials attribute it to the ban on potato exports imposed by the West Bengal government to prevent prices from rising in the potato cultivating state.According to officials from the department, the city requires nearly 600 quintals of potato per day, but is able to procure only around 350-400 quintals from other parts of the country.According to R Laxmanudu, regional joint director, agriculture marketing, Visakhapatnam, the ban had hit potato supply in Andhra Pradesh, with nearly 10 trucks carrying potatoes, which were scheduled to reach Vizag from West Bengal over the past one week, being stopped due to the ban.""We are making all possible efforts to procure potatoes from other parts of the country, particularly Agra, though it is nearly 1,600 km from the city. We have already sent some officials from our department to various potato growing areas in the country, including Agra, to boost imports to Visakhapatnam,"" Laxmanudu added.Though the West Bengal government on Thursday partially relaxed the ban for Odisha and Jharkhand for one week, there seems to be no end to the crisis in sight for potato-loving consumers in Andhra Pradesh, particularly Vizag.With consumers feeling the heat of the skyrocketing prices of the essential veggie, many feel that the state government should immediately pursue the matter with the West Bengal government to ensure that the ban is lifted and prices normalised.""On Thursday, West Bengal lifted the ban for a week for Odisha and Jharkhand upon requests by the chief ministers of the two states. I think the AP government was not successful in pursuing the matter with Mamata Bannerjee,"" complained a consumer at the MVP Colony Rythu Bazar.Sunit Kumar Panja, who hails from West Bengal and runs Hotel Nimantran on railway station road in the city, said he was against the West Bengal government's decision to ban potato exports. ""We live in India where no state is independent. All states depend on each other for various goods.

They moved towards the railway station and staged ?rail roko' for almost 45 minutes demanding exclusion of onions and potatoes from the ESA and scrapping of MEP on onions.Arjun Borade, Nashik district president of the Shetkari Sanghatana, told TOI, ""We were protesting against the central government decisions that are against the interests of the farmers. The decision to include onions and potatoes in ESA would bring restriction to the farmers on storing the commodity. Moreover, exports can't happen if the MEP is high. This has led to decline in onions prices causing financial losses to farmers. Hence, we demand that onion and potatoes be excluded from essential commodity act and MEP of onions removed.""The average wholesale onion price at the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee was recorded at Rs 1,675 a quintal. The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 600 and Rs 1,890 a quintal, respectively. Around 12,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Thursday."

224,Traders voice tuber worry,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140819/jsp/odisha/story_18733174.jsp,2014-08-19,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, Aug. 18: The potato crisis in the state has been resolved with Bengal government lifting its unofficial ban on the supply of the important vegetable. However, traders here fear that the situation may worsen if the state government does not take any step now. Bengal will review its stance on August 24. The traders say that the situation could become worse if the Bengal government imposes the restriction again after August 24. Sources said that on an average, 4,500 tonnes of potato a day would come to the state from Bengal. Around 400 trucks of potato have come to the state in last two days through the Laxmannath check gate. The administration there has not given any instruction to their traders beyond August 24. If the state government does not take precautionary measures, the situation will worsen, said Sudhakar Panda, secretary of the Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha. After the arrival of the tuber, the wholesale rate has gone down to Rs 18-20 a kg from Rs 24-28 a kg two days ago. However, the retailers continue to sell it at Rs 25-28 a kg. At many places, people complained that rates have not been reduced despite the supply picking up. Many traders complained that the trucks were detained at the border for over a week and the potatoes had started rotting. We will suffer heavy losses if we do not sell these potatoes soon and we have to sell them at a high price to recover our buying cost, said a retailer. Besides, of the 3,040 quintals of potato bought through the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited (Nafed), only 1,000 quintals have reached the state. These have been forwarded to different parts of the state to be sold at Rs 24 a kg. The remaining amount was expected to reach this week. As the situation has eased, the state government has stopped procuring potato from its cold storages. Officials in the food and civil supplies department said they were trying to focus on the present scenario. Potatoes are coming through Nafed. Talks are also on with the Bengal and other governments for supply of tubers to the state. We hope the situation will improve shortly, said an official."

However, a considerable drop in production is likely owing to climatic changes during the sowing season.The main crops likely to be hit are potato, cabbage, carrot, and garlic. It is estimated that there will be a 40 per cent fall in production for the Onam season, the harvesting for which has just begun.Bhagavathiappan, a farmer, says he had to sow the seeds for the season thrice  the first two attempts failed owing to drought conditions and a cloudburst in May-June. This is the season most favourable for potato and carrot cultivation, and the farmers often make up their losses through the Onam sale.Manikandans land at Perumala got flooded after the cloudburst, and his vegetable plants are now in the initial stage of growth.He says seasonal cultivation changed this time owing to the delayed sowing. The farmers here cultivate in the main two seasons of May/June and September/October. Almost all the farmers had to sow the seeds afresh after the first sowing failed owing to the drought situation.The June 2 cloudburst destroyed the seeds sown in the second round. It took the farmers weeks to clear the debris so that their lands could be prepared for another sowing.There are plots that have just been planted with vegetable crops, especially at Perumala, where the cloudburst caused severe damage. This will affect the arrival of vegetables from here for Onam.Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) assistant manager Harris Muhammed says 250 tonnes of vegetables from Kanthallur is expected for Onam. In addition to the VFPCK, Horticorp too will procure vegetables from the farmers through the Kanthallur Coolseason Vegetable Marketing Society. Farmers also directly sell produce to businessmen and middlemen, a system traditionally followed for years. Mr. Muhammed says the main cool season vegetables are expected to arrive in the market a little after Onam.The prices at the VFPCK auction centres have reached Rs.30 for a kilogram of carrot, Rs.25 for potato, and Rs.14 to 15 for cabbage as per latest estimates. This may rise further in the coming days owing to the delayed production and high demand."

227,Weak monsoon may hit recovery,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Weak-monsoon-may-hit-recovery/articleshow/34169611.cms,2014-08-23,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: With the economic growth hovering around 5% and the job scenario remaining weak, a ""below normal"" monsoon will be the first challenge awaiting the new government that will take charge just before the rainy season sets in. The already-stretched finances of the Centre will only add to the pressure.While economists warned that below normal rains do not necessarily mean a drought or significantly hit the growth rate, Corporate India is already talking about the monsoon further denting the already-battered sentiment and impacting sales at a time when it was sensing a reversal in fortunes.Private agencies had warned of the monsoon being below normal and, on Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast that rains will be below the average level. Coupled with that is the fear of the El Nino weather phenomenon impacting precipitation further.Videocon Group chairman V N Dhoot said that a bad monsoon may impact demand, especially in rural areas that depend on the farm sector. ""It's not good news at all. Even though the dependence on monsoon has gone down, it will affect sentiments and it will come at a time when we are a little optimistic about a turnaround,"" added Anil Dua, senior vice-president (marketing & sales), Hero MotoCorp, the country's largest two-wheeler maker. Rural areas account for 48% of the company's sales.Pravin Shah, CEO of Mahindra & Mahindra's automotive business, said, ""It doesn't have an immediate impact but it does impact sentiments."" Hero's rival and former partner Honda isn't reworking its targets just yet, although Y S Guleria, the head of sales and marketing at HMSI, says that monsoon and economic growth are inseparable.Economists are also not changing their forecasts just yet. ""The government should be on alert, we should prepare ourselves to deal with the prospects of below normal rains but there is not need to panic,"" said Ashok Gulati, chair professor for agriculture at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER).There may, however, be some impact on inflation. While north-west India, which has better irrigation facilities, may not be affected significantly, Gulati said there may be some impact on the western region which grows oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane and onions.With record food stocks, the government seems to be well-positioned to deal with demand for grain. But a prolonged dry spell does impact milk production and may even hit prices of vegetables such as onions, which has been a political hot potato in recent years.""It is early to assess the impact on growth, but it is a warning signal and there is a need to keep a watch on food inflation. It will be an important issue for the new government and it will have to take steps from day one,"" said A Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.But the impact on overall growth is not expected to be significant. ""If the total rainfall is 95% of the average with even spread of space and time, then the impact will not be very significant on agriculture production,"" said D K Pant, chief economist and head (public finance) at India Ratings, while sticking to his forecast of 3% farm sector growth this year.Dhoot cautioned that the government may have to increase spending in the rural areas to counter any negative fallout if the rainfall is highly deficient. Typically, in a rain-deficient year, the government gets banks to restructure farm loans and spends more on job-generating schemes in areas where there is severe shortfall."

But, by then, Sumangal had shut shop, including the headquarters at Chatterjee International, with all its directors absconding.The SIT is now seeking help from RBI, SEBI, Registrar of Companies (ROC) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) to trace the money trail. So far,Sumangal is expected to have amassed more than Rs 100 crore from Bengal and neighbouring states.Investigations have revealed that Sumangal promised depositors 30 to 100% returns on their investments within 15 months through a scheme involving purchase and subsequent sale of potatoes. ""In its advertisements, the company used to claim that 'funds collected from public shall be used to buy potatoes on behalf of depositors when the price is low and preserve them in cold storage to sell them when the market price rises'"", said an investigator.""The company used to say that profit percentage shall depend on the market price of potatoes and that it will take 15 months to complete the business cycle and return the investor the sale value of potatoes. The executives used to convince the depositors with forged documents,"" another investigator said.In October 2012, SEBI barred Sumangal from raising funds in the name of high returns. It also asked the company to reply within 15 days to its prima facie observations, and stopped the firm from diverting or alienating any assets of funds till further orders. The company was further directed not to launch any other collective investment scheme without approval. But, Sumangal kept collecting funds. Sumangal had said that it was trading in potatoes for which it has a trading licence and it was dealing in agricultural and non-agricultural products both within and outside India. The question of obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI did not arise.The Securities Appellate Tribunal has given it time till January 2015 to refund the money but, since then, the directors are absconding. They were suspected to have fled to neighbouring countries to evade arrest.Dr Soumya Roy is one such victim. He purchased Flexi bonds worth Rs 3,20,000 in April 2012. His bonds matured on July 28. He depsosited the bonds to Sumangal office for encashment. But he did not find anyone to pursue his case."
229,Price rider in potato export plan,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140826/jsp/bengal/story_18761804.jsp,2014-08-26,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Aug. 25: The Bengal government today told potato traders they would be allowed to export 700 tonnes to other states daily provided they sold the tuber to the state at Rs 12 a kilo. Agriculture department officials said the government planned to sell potatoes at Rs 14 a kg from its counters after buying the tuber at Rs 12 a kg. A section of officials feared that the offer, if implemented, could prompt potato traders to raise the price of the tuber in the open market. The proposal to allow the export was made in a meeting with the chief minister in Nabanna. The government took the decision at a time potato price has shot up from Rs 18 a kg to Rs 22 a kg following the ban on exports from July 28. The Jyoti variety of potato today sold at Rs 22 a kg in city markets. Under normal circumstances, traders send 10,000 tonnes of the tuber to other states daily. The traders have decided to hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the proposal of the government. An agriculture department official said the state planned to buy 250-300 tonnes of potato from traders at Rs 12 a kg and sell the crop at Rs 14 a kg from its 50 counters in Calcutta, Salt Lake and Howrah. The government had partially relaxed the export ban between August 17 and 23, allowing traders to send out 5,500 tonnes of the crop to Odisha and Jharkhand. Although the current export unit of 700 tonnes daily is lesser than the 785 tonnes during the earlier seven-day relaxation, the state has proposed no such time frame this time. Agriculture department officials said the decision to force traders to sell potato at a cheaper rate to the government could affect the much larger section which buys the tuber from the open market. It is expected that the losses the traders would incur by selling potato at a cheaper rate would be recovered while they release the crop in the open market. This could push up the price of potato during the coming festive season when the demand usually goes up, an official said. The official dubbed the states plan to sell potato at a discounted rate from its counters a face-saving effort. But as Bengal produces surplus potato, stopping traders from exporting the crop could lead to losses. The state has around 25 lakh tonnes of potato in its cold stores, against a consumption demand of 17 lakh tonnes till mid-November. The price of potato would not have shot up had the government not intervened in the export, an official said. The official added that the ban on export had prompted people to panic purchase, fearing that the price would go up. As the demand increased, the traders took the opportunity to raise the prices."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Aug. 25: After a brief relief, shortage of potatoes has resurfaced in the state after the Bengal government once again imposed its undeclared ban on transportation of tuber, but officials here claim that the situation is normal. The detention of a large number of Odisha-bound potato-laden trucks on the border by Bengal police yesterday set alarm bells ringing in the state. However, in last two days around 270 trucks of potato have come to the state through other routes. Of those, 60 had reached Bhubaneswar yesterday and only 20 arrived today. But this may not meet the requirement of the state and push up prices of the commodity. While the wholesale rate of potato in Bhubaneswar is Rs 22 per kg, traders are selling it at Rs 28-30 per kg in the retail market. At the same time, tuber procured through the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited (Nafed) is being sold at Rs 20 per kg in the market. From the end of last month till a week ago there was a prolonged ban on the supply of potatoes by the neighbouring government and it continued despite talks between officials and even between the chief ministers on both sides. It also forced the BJD workers to take retaliatory steps of detaining Bengal-bound trucks carrying essential items. To tackle the situation arising out of shortage in supply, the state government has instructed collectors to keep tabs on hoarders and conduct searches on the premises of traders stocking potatoes. Pravakar Rout, deputy director of food and civil supplies department, said that letters had been sent to the district collectors to check hoarding. They have been told to conduct police raids as potato has been declared an essential commodity, said Rout. He even said that there was enough stock of potatoes in the state and people should not be worried. Besides, fair price shops in six cities in the state have been selling potatoes at Rs 24 per kg. Sudhakar Panda, secretary of the All Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha, said that the Bengal government was also deliberating on the issue of supply of potatoes to Odisha. Whatever stocks we have in the state will last for a week and then the situation will worsen. We are keeping a watch on the task force meeting in Bengal, said Panda. The traders here said that the quality of Bengal potatoes was the reason for its demand in Odisha. Besides, there are many other factors such as higher costs that prevent them from importing potatoes from other sources. They said that Nafed-procured potatoes from Kanpur sold at a lower price, but it was of poor quality and not preferred by people."

However, SIT has doubts how much money the sale of these small publications would fetch.For smaller Ponzi firms, which suffered losses while responding to panic redemption by depositors, the situation is grave. SIT investigation spread across Kolkata, Bidhannagar and Barrackpore has come across at least 10 cases where panic FIRs finally led to winding up of the Ponzi firms. For those still functioning, their primary aim now is to retain the investor confidence and expand their network.According to a senior SIT officer, these firms were mostly set up following the Saradha model. ""In several FIRs, we found that the complaint was made for pre-mature withdrawal,"" he said. Investigation revealed that these companies used to promise depositors 30 to 100% return on their investments within 15 to 18 months through several schemes that bordered on the 'production of tea to wood or potatoes' and their sale in the market.""The percentage of profit shall depend on the market price of these products. It takes 15 months to complete the whole business cycle and return to the investor the sale value of his 'products'. The company executives used to convince the depositors with lot of forged documents,"" said the officer.Kolkata Police are handling several such cases as well. ""When we began to look into the accounts, we found one depositor's money was being doled out to another. These fly-by-night companies often did not have a proper office that could be sold off to pay back the depositors,"" said the source.SIT believes that such operations are far from being over. ""We are aware of such companies still operating in the heart of Kolkata. This has baffled many of us as urban investors are expected to be more savvy and aware of the risk of investing in such schemes,"" said an officer.SIT now wants to treat one case at a time to ensure all the accused gets conviction. ""Unlike the Saradha investigations when we came under criticism for not involving professionals like chartered accountants and chartered firms to carry out audits, we are not repeating the mistake. For example, we are in touch and seeking help in the Sumangal Industries Flexi Potato Scheme from organizations like Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Registrar of Companies (ROC) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) to trace the money trail. So far, by a conservative estimate, Sumangal is suspected to have amassed more than Rs 100 crore from different district in Bengal and neighbouring states,"" said a SIT official."

There are more outlets, but some have been stopped due to non-payment of dues by vendors or for some other reasons.The sales under the scheme has grown over the years. In, 2008-09, it was 4.5crore, in 2009-10, 13.05 crore, in 2010-11, 29.59 crore, in 2011-12, 38.85 crore and in 2012-13, 58.89 crore.The scheme was started to provide citizens with subsidized vegetables and essential commodities to cope with the price rise. The scheme was started with six vegetables - potatoes, tomatoes, onion, cabbage, cauliflower and bhendi. Subsequently, green chillies, French beans, carrot and cluster beans were added and now the corporation supplies 10 types of vegetables.Under the scheme, the corporation also supplies essential commodities like sugar, atta, moong, toor dal and watana. ""At whatever price we buy, at that price we sell. All overheads of transportation, loading, unloading, commission to suppliers, etc. are borne by the government,"" said Orlando Rodrigues, GSHC managing director.Today, the corporation procures about 30 tonnes of tomatoes, 40 tonnes of potatoes and 50 tonnes of onions on a daily basis. Other items procured are in the range of five to 10 tonnes daily. Vegetables are sourced mostly from Maharashtra and Karnataka but green chillies are sometimes sourced from Andhra Pradesh and potatoes from Indore, Madhya Pradesh.The scheme involves some tedious logistics. Rodrigues said that the corporation conveys its order for the next day to the 13 suppliers around noon every day. The suppliers give their quotations late in the evening and the corporation finalizes the lowest bidders at 9.30pm.Though the items are sourced from numerous places, the packaging is done at Belgaum and the trucks leave Belgaum for Goa around 10.30pm, every night. Around 2.30am, supervisors of the corporation board the trucks on various routes like Ponda, Margao, etc, and accompany the trucks to the various outlets in their areas. There are 39 trucks that bring in the supplies. Around 9.30am, all outlets in Goa are stocked with their quota of vegetables.In addition to supplying these 10 vegetables under the scheme, the horticulture corporation also procures and supplies another 20 types of vegetables and 14 types of fruits. These are supplied at non-subsidized but reasonable rates.Among the fruits, the corporation supplies apples, sweet lime, orange, watermelon, banana, papaya, chickoo, pomegranate, etc. It is on the sale of these non-subsidized items that the corporation makes its profits. The GSHC presently has a total turnover of around 110crore, Rodrigues said."

During last financial year, the administration earned around Rs 5 crore as revenue from its share of market fee.The move has been made following directions from the central government to wave off market fee on fruits and vegetables.The government is also considering to compensate the loss of revenue during initial period to the states/UT on this account.In a recently held meeting of secretaries, the UT adviser directed deputy commissioner Mohammed Shayin to issue notification for exempting fruits and vegetables from the APMC Act at the earliest.The market fee has direct bearing on the retail prices of fruits and vegetables. The administration has received several representations from city residents in the past one year for putting a check on rising prices of fruits and vegetables.Surinder Kaur (66), a retired schoolteacher, said, The ever-rising prices of essential commodities have made things difficult for everyone, especially for those with limited financial resources. The administration should take charge and ensure that the city residents get essential commodities at reasonable rates.When contacted, the UT adviser said they had received directions from the central government and they were in the process of framing a policy which would be put before the UT administrator for approval.Arhtiya association opposes moveWith wholesalers set to incur loss from waving off the market fee on fruits and vegetables, the Mandi Arhtiya Association has objected to the move.The administration had invited suggestions from the association on the exemption of the market fee. Balbir Singh, chairman, Sabzi Mandi Arhtiya Association said: We strongly disapprove of waving off the market fee as the decision will hurt the wholesalers. We have intimated the administration about this.Sources said different associations were exerting pressure on the administration for not implementing the directions of the central government.Tomato prices double over the past weekAn erratic monsoon with heavy rainfall in Himachal Pradesh, scanty showers in the south of the country and consistent rise in diesel prices leading to a rise in transportation cost have led to an increase in the prices of vegetables in the city by around 20% over the past week. The price of staples in any kitchen, tomatoes and potatoes, have risen by about 30%.The vendors in Sector-26 vegetable market blame the scanty monsoon in the south and heavy rains in Himachal Pradesh, for the hike in prices and say that it is because of the insufficient supply that the prices, especially of tomatoes have seen a spurt.Deepak Kumar, a wholesale trader in the market, said, The monsoon has been erratic this year. At some places, there has been scanty rainfall and at others excess rain has taken its toll. Even otherwise, in this season, the new crop coming to the market is always more expensive. The hike in diesel prices is also a factor. Besides tomatoes, the prices of peas, lemon and potatoes have seen a spurt.Due to heavy rain in Himachal Pradesh, the tomato production has been hit, resulting in the low supply, a vendor said."
235,Potato strike call sparks price fear,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140829/jsp/bengal/story_18775354.jsp,2014-08-29,Telegraph,"Aug. 28: Potato traders in Bengal today announced a three-day ceasework from September 1 to protest a condition set by the government for a partial relaxation of the export ban, raising fears of a price rise. On Monday, the Bengal government had told potato traders that they would be allowed to export 700 tonnes daily to other states provided they made a part of the produce available to the administration at Rs 12 a kilo for sale in designated counters in Calcutta, Salt Lake and Howrah at Rs 14 a kilo. The Pragatishil Aloo Byabsayee Samiti, the largest organisation of potato traders in Bengal, today held a meeting in Burdwan town to discuss the governments condition, which was set during a meeting chaired by chief minister Mamata Banerjee at Nabanna on Monday. We were told we would be allowed to send 700 tonnes of potato to other states if we sell 300 tonnes at Rs 12 a kilo to the government daily. But how can we do that? We buy the Jyoti variety of potato from farmers at Rs 13 a kilo, which includes cold storage charges. Then we have to pay for transporting stocks to wholesale markets. The price becomes at least Rs 16 a kilo by this stage, said Santanu Manna, the president of the samiti. Senior state government officials said if the traders did not take the produce out of cold storages, prices were bound to rise. If supply is affected, prices will definitely rise. Within five days of the government imposing the ban on the export of potato on July 28, the price at markets in Calcutta and its neighbouring areas rose to Rs 22 a kilo from Rs 18 a kilo. The price in the districts jumped to Rs 20 a kilo. This was because traders held back stocks, an official said. The Jyoti variety of potato is still selling at Rs 22 a kilo in city markets. Officials said they would not face any trouble running the 50 counters even if the samiti went ahead with its ceasework threat as the West Bengal Cold Storage Association had agreed to supply potato to the agriculture marketing department at Rs 13.30 a kilo. Although the association sells only 40 tonnes of potato a week to the government, the counters would not run short of stocks as a maximum of 1 kilo is sold to each customer, the officials said. But a large section of people will face problems as the counters have been set up at select markets in Calcutta, Howrah and Salt Lake. Any squeeze on the supply will further raise the price of potato. As it is, the price of potato goes up in the festive season because of a rise in demand, another official said."

238,"Supply stops, potato worry returns to haunt state",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140901/jsp/odisha/story_18785549.jsp,2014-09-01,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar/Balasore, Aug. 31: The spectre of potato shortage is beginning to haunt Odisha as the Bengal government has once again imposed its ban on the movement of tuber outside the state. Irregular supply of potatoes from the neighbouring state has affected stocks in markets across Odisha, while tuber traders in Bengal have threatened to go on strike against the decision of the Mamata Banerjee government. If there is no change in the present situation, as supply of potatoes from Bengal has stopped since Friday, the vegetable is likely to become scare in markets across the state. In the retail market, the price of potatoes is hovering between Rs 22 and Rs 25 depending on its quality. It might reach the earlier mark of Rs 30 if supplies from the neighbouring state are not ensured within three to four days. Mrutyunjay Tripathy, a government employee and regular to Unit I Daily Market, said: As salaried people we are really worried over the development since the last one and half months. The officials should talk with their Bengal counterparts to end the present stalemate. Kalindi Jaysing, a retail vegetable vendor at Pokhariput, said: I am selling potatoes at Rs 24-a-kilo, but if the supplies are not available after one or two days then I will sell for no less than Rs 30. The ban on supply from Bengal is going to hit the people hard. President of Perishable Goods Association in Balasore Ajay Biswal told The Telegraph: Odisha requires about 320-325 truckload of potatoes for its domestic consumption, but now only 20-25 trucks are crossing the state border for the past several days. The market is likely to be hit by the short supply. Sources said that near the Laxmannath tollgate on the Bengal-Odisha border, around 50 trucks were awaiting clearance from the administration in Bengal. Last week, traders from Balasore threatened not to order potatoes from Bengal as the police were torturing the drivers while checking vehicles. The situation became so critical that traders were forced to get potato consignments from Bengal through the Jharkhand route. Balasore civil supplies officer Birendra Sahu said: Since last Sunday, around 200 potato trucks were coming from Bengal through the Jamsola tollgate instead of Laxmannath. But that has stopped since Friday. There will be a major problem if this situation continues. We have heard that the potato traders of Bengal are holding talks with their government. The entire supply dynamics depends on its outcome, he said. General secretary of the Unit I Daily Market Traders Association, Bhubaneswar, Gayadhar Swain said: We are selling potatoes for Rs 1,900 to Rs 2,000 a quintal to retail traders and they are selling at Rs 22 to Rs 24-a-kilo, depending on the quality. But the Bengal governments ban may change the scenario again. However, the ban on export of potatoes continues in Bengal. In a bid to reign in potato prices, the Bengal government had first imposed the ban on July 28 this year. Then, between August 17 and 23, the Bengal government partially withdrew the ban, allowing 5,000 tonnes to be transported to Odisha and 500 tonnes to Jharkhand. After the week-long liberty, the Bengal government imposed the ban once again and proposed to potato traders that they would have to supply 300 tonnes to the government every day at Rs 12-a-kilo, after which they would be allowed to export 700 tonnes daily to other states. But the traders refused to accept this proposal, saying supplying 300 tonnes at Rs 12 per kg was not feasible."

(Sanat Kr. Sinha) Traffic in several parts of Calcutta came to a standstill on Monday afternoon because of a Left Front rally to protest Israeli attacks on Gaza. More than a lakh supporters joined the rally from Ram Leela Maidan off Moulali to Deshbandhu Park near Shyambazar, which resulted in crippling snarls for hours on key arteries such as AJC Bose Road, Lenin Sarani, APC Road, MG Road, Narkeldanga Main Road, Keshab Chandra Sen Street and Vivekananda Road. The rally lasted from 2pm till 5pm but the ripple effects continued well past 5pm. What is the significance of holding a rally in Calcutta to protest an incident happening thousands of miles away? If they really want to protest, they should focus on more pressing issues like the rise in potato prices and the poor condition of roads, said Sambudhhwa Banerjee, who was stuck in a snarl on the Sealdah flyover for close to an hour. CPM leaders, however, thought otherwise. The BJP government is not protesting the attacks on innocent people in Palestine and is in fact supporting the moneyed class and indirectly helping Israel. Hence, there is a need to create an awareness on the issue among Calcuttans, said CPM state secretary Biman Bose. The rally, one of the biggest in the city in recent times, was attended by CPM supporters and activists from across the state. To add to the chaos were 38 tableaux and several Matadors and buses that rolled slowly along with the marching men and women holding red flags and placards and shouting slogans against the US and Israel. School students returning home were among the worst sufferers. Children from Apeejay School, Loreto House (Sealdah), Ashok Hall, St. James School and Mahadevi Birla World Academy were stuck in snarls for several hours. Three buses carrying students of Apeejay School were stuck near Moulali on AJC Bose Road for close to two hours. The buses, packed with students from classes V to X, were headed for Baguiati, Burrabazar and Shyambazar. The parents were calling us up to know the exact location of the buses. They were anxious and so were we, said Rita Chatterjee, the principal of Apeejay School, Park Street. We waited for half an hour after the school got over at 2pm. But since none of the vehicles around us was moving, we decided to walk, said Roshni Aslam, a Class V student who walked home to Rajabazar with her sister Saira, a student of Class IV."

Picture by Animesh Sengupta Potatoes are once again acting pricey in Jamshedpur, thanks to fresh restrictions imposed on supply of the tuber by the neighbouring Bengal government. Prices of the ubiquitous vegetable, which was selling for Rs 38 a kg early August after the Bengal government first imposed the ban, had come down to Rs 25 a kg from August 23 onwards, giving relief to homemakers. But the respite was only temporary, as prices suddenly went up from Monday. Now, the ubiquitous vegetable is selling for Rs 34-35 a kg in steel city markets, a straight leap of Rs 10. The rates will further go up if supply is not resumed soon. Trucks will potato consignments are not being allowed to cross the Bengal border since August 30. This is because the neighbouring state has introduced fresh restrictions on supply. If there is a shortage of the vegetable, prices will naturally go up, said Rajkumar Shah, a leading potato trader of Jamshedpur. According to Shah, after initially completely banning transportation of potatoes to Jharkhand and other states in the first week of August, the Bengal government decided to ration supply. It restricted 100 tonnes of potatoes for Jharkhand per day, 400 tonnes for Odisha and 200 tonnes to Assam. After the new sanctions, we brought the vegetable from Bengal through Baharagora and Chakulia and prices came down to Rs 24/25 a kg. But from August 30, supply was again stopped. As there is no buffer stock, vendors are charging more, Shah added. Jamshedpur needs 20 trucks of potatoes every day. The fresh crisis has prompted the Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) president Suresh Sonthalia to mull writing to Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee once again. Last time, we had written to the Bengal chief minister, requesting her to lift the ban on potato supply to Jharkhand, especially to Jamshedpur. Thereafter, the trucks started coming to the city. Now, it seems that we will again have to take up the matter with her, Sonthalia told The Telegraph. Consumers, especially homemakers, are fuming. I was relieved when prices of potatoes came down to Rs 25 a kg. I had actually thought that it would further go down. But the price demon has come back to haunt us, playing havoc with our kitchen budget, rued Nivedita Sinha, a resident of Contractors Area in Bistupur."

Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh and deputy chief minister Gaikhangam left for New Delhi yesterday to meet home minister Rajnath Singh today and discuss the United Naga Councils decision to ban all national projects in Naga areas and ban all vehicular movement along the national and state highways. The consumer affairs, food and public distribution department yesterday announced a contingency plan to ensure unrestricted supply of essential commodities, including rice and petroleum products. PDD minister M. Okendro announced this at his office yesterday after a cabinet meeting presided over by the chief minister. Okendro said necessary measures have been taken up to ensure the unrestricted supply of essential commodities to the public. He appealed to the people not to panic and said in accordance with the state governments contingency plan, rice and fuel will be distributed under a rationing system. The minister said there is rice for 55 days, wheat for 91 days, sugar for nine days, petrol for 15 days, diesel for 17 days, kerosene for 33 days and LPG for just six days. He said the government would not allow an undue hike in prices of essential commodities and would continue shipping in rice, fuel oils and other essential commodities with central paramilitary escorts. The UNC had announced an indefinite ban on transport along the national highways that pass through the Naga-inhabited areas and a ban on all national projects from 6am tomorrow.

244,It is not right for the RBI governor to blame patchy monsoons for food inflation,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/it-is-not-right-for-the-rbi-governor-to-blame-patchy-monsoons-for-food-inflation/,2014-09-06,The Times Of India,"The RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has voiced his concern on food inflation, which he said is bound to be affected by this years patchy monsoon. The governors concerns are valid as food prices have proved to be sticky. But rather than blame patchy rains for the inflationary spiral on the food front he should rather persuade the government to identify the structural factors that constrain food production and find suitable remedies.But the concerns on food prices remain real. Though the wholesale price inflation has steadily slowed down from a peak level of 7.5% in November 2013 to 5.2% in July 2014 and consumer price inflation come down from 11.2% to 8% during the period the food prices have remained at much higher levels. In fact the most recent numbers for July show that while food prices in the wholesale markets are still rising by 8.4% while it was even higher at 9.4% in the consumer markets. This will certainly impinge on the RBI efforts to bring down consumer price inflation below 8% January 2015.However, though patchy rainfalls have remained a concern through the current monsoon season the worries has ebbed to some extent as the sown area of crops has slowly edged up to 986.6 lakh hectares by the first week of September which is barely 3% short of the of the 1020.8 lakh hectares sown in the corresponding period of the last year. And most recent report from the ministry of water resources also show that the water storage in the 85 largest reservoirs in the country was 110.5 billion cubic meters which is around 104% of the average storage during the last ten years.So rather than patchy monsoons it is structural factors that keep food prices abnormally higher than the overall prices. A cursory glance of the food production statistics shows how structural factors have constrained the increase in food supply in recent years. The best example here is about vegetables where prices continued to increase at 16.9% in July 2014, the most recent month for which data is available.Numbers from the ministry of agriculture show that despite the scorching increase in vegetable prices the supply of vegetables have not gone up to meet the growing demands. Figures for the last two years, 2012-13 and 2013-14, show that growth of vegetable has stagnated at a low 3.7% in both years. And there was also a growing instability in output. For instance in case of an important crop like potatoes the production has even declined in the most recent year after shooting up sharply in the previous year. Similarly both onions and tomatoes production declined in 2012-13 years but has picked up marginally in 2013-14.So rather than bad monsoons it is constraints on increasing supply of production which remains the real reason for the high food prices. And there is very little that the RBI can do about it. But rather than blaming the patchy rains the RBI governor would do much better to identify the supply constraints that inhibit food production and persuade the government to push through remedial reforms that will ensure that food production will pick up in consonance with growing demand and bring down prices."

The prices of cow beans, carrot, cabbage, potato and many other vegetables are very high. Traders fear that the prices will continue to increase in the coming days.The price increase is mainly owing to the fact that Kerala depends on the neighbouring States for its supply of vegetables.

The price of banana has reached a record level of Rs.80-90, said V.L. Dencil, the secretary of the Merchants Association.A kg of cow beans is selling at Rs.100. Drum sticks are selling at Rs.70-80. The price of bitter gourd is Rs. 50 while potato is Rs.45.Shortage in the arrival of vegetables is the main reason for the price rise, says Mr. Dencil.The untimely rain has heavily affected the production of vegetables in the State. The rain has affected vegetable production in Tamil Nadu too, he said.The rain also thwarted the hopes of the government and the agriculture department, which have been promoting family vegetable gardens in the State.More than 90 per cent of the vegetables that the State uses has been coming from Tamil Nadu. The local production, mainly leafy vegetables, bitter gourd, snake gourd and ash gourd now constitute hardly 10 per cent of the total consumption."
246,Prices most high in Tripura,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140908/jsp/northeast/story_18810626.jsp,2014-09-08,Telegraph,"Agartala, Sept. 7: Among all the 29 states in the country, Tripura holds the dubious distinction of having the highest price rise level at 20.6 per cent. Minister of food and civil supplies Bhanulal Saha described the price level in the state as normal in view of the high transportation costs in importing goods and commodities in the state located in a corner of the Northeast. The issue came up for discussion in the state Assembly last evening in the form of a call-attention motion moved by Congress MLAs Ratanlal Nath and Gopal Chandra Roy. Initiating the discussion, Nath cited the contents of a report published in a national newspaper on the price situation in different states of the country, which showed Tripura at the highest level with 20.6 per cent inflation. This news analysis has been published with authentic information culled from official sources in all the states of the country. It shows that the price level is always high in northeastern states but even among them Tripura holds the highest position. Tripura is the most expensive state in the country. Apart from goods and commodities of daily use, the price of construction materials in the state is 23.3 per cent higher than all other states, Nath said. He said the newspaper had described Tripura as the champion in price rise and commented that the less said about Tripura the better. Nath and later Roy said there was no match between the prices of goods at source level and prices at which they are sold within the state. Both of them quoted the rates of goods and commodities referred to by the state government to assert that the state government had no control over the market and no action was being taken over hoarding and overpricing. Green chillies used to sell for Rs 50 per kg in 2012 but now the price ranges between Rs 150 and Rs 200. This is just one instance. The prices of all goods and commodities have registered a steep hike. Tomatoes used to sell for Rs 35 per kg in 2012 but now they are available at Rs 70 per kg. This is despite the fact that there is no supply constraint or production fall, Nath and Roy said. They held the state government is responsible for this and said in case the food and civil supplies department had been more careful and sensitive to the suffering of the people things would not have turned so bad. They cited the instance of Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee stopping the sale of potato outside the state to mitigate the price hike of the vegetable. Replying to the motion, Saha said the price level in Tripura was not very unusual. Prices of some goods are less than what they are in Delhi but if prices rise at source, we can do nothing. Besides, the transportation cost is higher in Tripura because of the states isolated geographical location. He said a slew of measures, including goods transit across Bangladesh were being taken to keep the price level normal in view of the stoppage of railway services from October 1 for gauge conversion. We have also held a meeting with businessmen and their representatives regarding the price situation. They have assured us of co-operation and efforts to keep the price level normal, said Saha."

The government is trying to facilitate their movement under heavy security cover.Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, who met Union home minister Rajnath Singh over the impasse a few days ago, said people should not panic as the state's stock of essential items, including rice and sugar, in the FCI godown in Imphal would see it through for at least two months.The blockade has caused prices of essential commodities to soar. The state government has begun hoarding fuel at limited outlets. It has not initiated dialogue with UNC to break the deadlock.People are paying Rs 140 for a litre of petrol in the grey market, while the prices of onions, potatoes and pulses have also increased. ""Because of the inflation, my family budget has gone haywire. I'm extremely worried,"" said Tarana Devi, a housewife in Imphal. ""During the 100-day economic blockade last time, we paid Rs 2,000 for an LPG cylinder and Rs 240 for a litre of petrol,"" she said.As the Imphal-Dimapur and Imphal-Silchar highways are bearing the brunt of the strike, air fares are hurting pockets most.

""All Imphal-bound flights have been packed since the last five or six days,"" said Keisham Gunadhor, proprietor of an Imphal-based travel agency, and added five flights are operating on a daily basis from Imphal airport.UNC called the indefinite highway blockade in protest against the killing of two Naga youths in police firing in Ukhrul town. UNC, which is demanding Alternative Arrangement for Nagas living in Manipur outside the purview of the state government pending the Indo-Naga settlement, has also clamped an indefinite ban on construction work for national projects in the state.On the other hand, BJP's Manipur and Nagaland in-charge Tapir Gao said he would urge the Centre to bring about an immediate solution to the UNC blockade.Komrem Union Manipur (KRUM), an apex body of six small tribal communities, has urged UNC to withdraw its blockade."

Shyamlal Mewara, principal secretary of the department, told reporters here this evening that the state has a stock of over 20,000 metric tonnes of potatoes in different cold storages and people dont need to be worried about potato shortage. Mewara said the demand of potato in the state is being met by imports from Uttar Pradesh and Meghalaya. He said the Bengal government is yet to allow their potatoes to come to Assam despite secretariat-level communications between the two states and Dispurs appeal to the Centre to intervene into the matter. Potatoes from Bengal are the cheapest. The public does not need to be worried about the availability of potato. Besides the stock in cold storages we are even getting potatoes from Uttar Pradesh. Today, we received 17 trucks of potatoes from Uttar Pradesh, said Mewara. He said the state government has not set any bar on the retail price of potatoes but it should not cross over Rs 35 per kg. Mewara said the price of potatoes is comparatively more in Guwahati than other places in Assam because the city needs to carry it from its nearest cold storage, which is at Morigaon. He asked Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner S. Angamuthu to take action if retailers are found to be selling potatoes for more than Rs 35 per kg."

The traders in the state said 26 trucks of potato had reached Odisha today. Five truckloads of potato have reached Bhubaneswar, which, however, needs over 300 trucks of tuber everyday. According to the traders association, these few trucks, which were in transit, arrived today and there was no chance of any more potato coming to the state from tomorrow onwards. The traders association met food supply and consumer welfare secretary Madhusudan Padhi and briefed him about the current situation. But, the government officials seem to be ignorant about the current potato shortage and expressed their helplessness about the recurring problem. The wholesale price of potato was Rs 24 per kg today in Bhubaneswar, while the retail price remained between Rs 28 and Rs 32 at various places in the city. But, the traders fear that as there has been no more supply of potato, the godown at Aiginia is almost empty and it would raise the price within a day. Yesterday, we met the government officials and informed them about the current shortage. We told them that we, the traders, are helpless, as the Bengal government has imposed the undeclared ban. Now, its up to the government to take appropriate step, said secretary of the Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangh Sudhakar Panda. The traders even blamed the state government for the present potato shortage, as it has not taken proper steps for the past two months to address the recurrent problem. While the Bengal government has been enforcing the undeclared ban every now and then, the Odisha government should hold discussion with the former and sort out the issue. The central government should also be informed about such problems, said a trader requesting anonymity. Panda said the traders association had been trying to control hoarding-like situations keeping the interest of consumers. In another development, Padhi said that as the traders in Bengal were on strike, the state government here was helpless. Our chief secretary is going to write to the Bengal government to sort out the problem, he said."

An input by agriculture ministry has estimated a drop in the early kharif onion crop due to deficit rains in June and July.The harvest of kharif onion crop is likely to get delayed by 2-3 weeks. Sources said there is plan to import three lakh tonnes of onion from countries including Pakistan, Afghanistan and Egypt.Already the Centre has taken several steps including allowing the state governments to fix stockholding limit on onion and potatoes so that the state agencies can crack down on hoarders. Though this step was taken following demand by several states, only two state governments - West Bengal and Telengana - have notified the stockholding limits so far while the process has just been initiated in Delhi and Punjab.Surprisingly, not even a single BJP-ruled state has come out with the stockholding limits since the Centre announced this policy on July 2.Sources said Maharashtra, the biggest onion producing state, has said there is no need for such a notification since onion cannot be stored for long. The Gujarat government has submitted that they have a strict monitoring mechanism to check hoarding.""These may be their arguments. Then why had they been demanding this for months? Before we authorized them to decide on the stockholding limits, they were putting blame on the Centre for rising prices of onion and potato despite knowing it well that checking hoarding and black marketing are state issues,"" said a government official.He said now with the Centre taking enough steps and coming out with adequate enabling provisions for the state government, there is hardly any room for passing the buck.On Wednesday, food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said, ""There will not be any problem in supply of essential food items, especially rice, wheat, sugar and pulses even if rainfall is less. There is no question of price rise in these items.""

The States could take whatever measures they deemed fit to encourage mill owners to remunerate cane growers. The move comes in the backdrop of a spate of suicides and threat from farmers to stop growing cane.Presenting the initiatives and achievements of the Ministry of Consumers Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in the first 100 days, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said many meetings had been held with apex bodies of the sugar sector and representatives of major sugar-producing States.About 45 per cent of outstanding dues had been cleared, and the Centre had expedited the process of facilitating payment of arrears and disbursal of interest-free loan to the sugar sector. As on September 4, 2014, Rs. 5,511 crore of the sanctioned Rs. 6,094 crore had been disbursed. Government incentive for the export of raw sugar had been revised to Rs. 3,371 per tonne for August-September from Rs 3,300 for June-July. Also, the import duty on raw sugar was increased from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. As a result, sugarcane arrears came down to Rs. 7,760 crore from Rs. 14,095 crore as on May 31, 2014.To check the prices of essential food items, potato and onions would be declared essential items under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, the Minister said. States had been authorised to impose stock limits to check hoarding.Mr. Paswan said the floods in Jammu and Kashmir had resulted in the loss of nearly 8,000 tonnes of food grain. But there was enough stock in the State to meet the demand for the next two months. There would be no shortage of food in the State."

In retail market, the price of potato has gone past Rs 35 per kilogram in the city as well as in most parts of the state.

Das Burma, however, said people should not panic, as the state has enough potato stocked in cold storages. The district collectors have been told to control the situation and not to allow hoarding. The collectors of those districts having no cold storages have been told to procure potato from neighbouring districts and sell through PDS outlets, he said.

The decision was taken at a meeting chief minister Mamata Banerjee held with potato traders and agriculture department officials at Nabanna. The traders have agreed to the arrangement. The meeting was held a day after the potato traders called off their three-day-old strike in view of the meeting. The 1,100 tonnes that can be exported have to be taken out of cold storages in south Bengal. A decision on a similar arrangement in north Bengal will be taken soon, agriculture department officials said. The 200 tonnes of potato that the traders will sell daily to the government will be sold at Rs 14 a kilo in counters the agri-marketing department has set up in designated markets in Calcutta, Salt Lake and Howrah. Today, potato sold at prices between Rs 25 and Rs 28 a kilo in Calcutta markets. A total of 1,100 tonnes of potato can be exported through two checkpoints in West Midnapore daily if the traders give 200 tonnes a day to the government at Rs 13 a kilo. The traders have agreed to this. A similar arrangement will be put in place in the six north Bengal districts soon, said Subrata Biswas, the agriculture secretary. Nabanna officials said the government, whose intervention in the market in July had fuelled the rise in the price of potato, was forced to lift the export ban partially following pressure from the traders. Earlier, the government had announced that it would allow the traders to export 700 tonnes a day provided they sold 300 tonnes to the administration at Rs 12 a kilo. A minister said the government would try to sell to retailers at the subsidised rate of Rs 14 a kilo some of the stock they received from the traders. We will try to do this so that people get potatoes at cheaper rates in the festive season, he said. Officials, however, said it would not be possible to give stocks to retailers. Bengals daily consumption of potato is 16,000 tonnes. There is no way the government can give retailers potato from the stock it buys from the traders, an official said. The president of the Pragatishil Aloo Byabsayee Samiti, Shantanu Manna, said tonight that the association, Bengals largest organisation of potato traders, had agreed to the proposal.

Transport minister Madan Mitra, textiles minister Shyamapada Mukherjee, food minister Jyotipriyo Mullick and North Bengal development minister Goutam Deb were absent on different grounds leading to speculation that a reshuffle is likely before the next cabinet meeting in November.According to political analysts, Madan Mitra finds himself on a sticky wicket after his former confidential assistant Bablu Karim and another close aide Prashanta Pramnik were questioned by CBI in the Saradha scam. This has led to a speculation that Madan might be dropped from the cabinet since the CM wants to keep her image clean. Insiders say Mamata did not exchange a word with Madan during a transport department programme, recently.Some of Madan's colleagues tried to explain his absence on Friday by saying he was recuperating after being discharged from a nursing home. The minister said the same thing. ""I am still recovering. Don't try to make a political interpretation of it,"" he said.But, others said that the government is trying to distance itself from leaders whose names have been dragged in the Saradha scam.Madan was also reportedly the president of the employees' association of the Saradha Group.Textiles minister Syamapada Mukherjee was earlier questioned by ED as he had allegedly sold his cement factory to the Saradha group. Insiders said that the CM wants to get rid of the leaders allegedly associated with the scam as it's damaging the image of the party.Meanwhile, there is speculation that some rival parties may try to support a breakaway faction of Trinamool MLAs. Sensing this, Mamata is also treading cautiously. Already, a group of senior Trinamool leaders has demanded removal of the 'tainted ministers'. But, Mamata is reportedly in two minds, as it would mean turning a section of party leaders against her.Mamata has asked ministers to be extra-cautious during the festive season as she expects Opposition parties to ""create trouble "", say sources. The ministers were also asked to keep tab on the price rise. On Friday, she held a meeting with potato sellers allowing them to sell potatoes outside the state.In the cabinet meeting, a decision was taken to set up a new municipal corporation with headquarters at Chandernagore which will serve the people living in the municipalities of Bansberia, Hooghly, Chinsurah, Bhadreshwar, Baidyabati, Sheoraphuli, Champdani, Serampore, Rishra, Konnagar and Uttarpara-Kotrang, said municipal affairs minister Firhad Hakim.

261,Saradha was running ponzi schemes; to face prosecution: SFIO,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/430946/saradha-running-ponzi-schemes-face.html,2014-09-15,Deccan Herald,"Saradha was running ponzi schemes; to face prosecution: SFIONew Delhi, Sep 15, 2014 (PTI): 12:14 ISTCompleting its probe into 'chit fund scam' of 14 Saradha group firms, SFIO today said these companies have been found to be running 'ponzi schemes' and would face prosecution for violation of several laws.The investigation concluded that the group was using collections from new investors to make payments to the previously-enrolled members, rather than from income generated through investments, in typical resemblance to a ponzi scheme.Among others, the activities of these companies were found to be in serious violations of the Companies Act, the Sebi Act, and several provisions of the Indian Penal Code, the Corporate Affairs Ministry said in a statement on completion of the SFIO probe.The Ministry said those companies which have been found to have violated the Sebi regulations for 'collective investment schemes' would be prosecuted for violation of Sebi Act, instead of the Companies Act, as the former carried longer terms of imprisonment.Besides, prosecution would also be initiated by the state governments for violations of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Banning) Act, while the probe report and necessary evidence would be shared with CBI to avoid duplication in prosecutions.The scam, wherein lakhs of investors in West Bengal and neighbouring states were defrauded of thousands of crores through illegal money pooling activities, came to light early last year and has also had its political ramifications. The case has also become a political hot potato with Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government facing flak from various quarters.""The companies, their promoters, directors and managerial personnel have been found guilty on many counts of various provisions of the Companies Act... dealing with illegal collection of deposits and false statements, etc"", it said. ""Several instances of violation of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, 1978 have also been found. As prosecution under this law are to be initiated by the State Governments concerned, the Report along with evidence is being shared with the CBI.""The Report is also being shared with Sebi for proceeding against companies which were found to be running unauthorised/ illegal Collective Investment Schemes (CIS),"" the government said.It said that the Serious Fraud Investigation Office also found evidence of violation of several provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). ""Such Sections are 107 (Abetment of Crime), 120B (Criminal Conspiracy), 403 (Dishonest misappropriation of property), 406 (Criminal breach of trust), 409 (Criminal breach of trust by public servant), 415 (Cheating), 418 (Cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss will be caused), 419 (Punishment for cheating by personation) and 477A (Falsification of accounts).""Since, CBI is now investigating cases under the IPC under orders of the Supreme Court, it has been decided to share evidence collected by the SFIO with CBI so as to avoid duplication in prosecutions,"" the government said.In the wake of public protests, the Ministry also asked SFIO in April 2013 to probe the case. The agency, which looks into white collar crimes and violations of companies law, investigated more than 60 companies in this regard.The probe agency had questioned many people including leaders from the Trinamool Congress party, while Saradha Group chief Sudipta Sen and some others were put behind the bars. An interim report was submitted by SFIO in September 2013.Sebi had also passed an order against Saradha Realty in April last year, soon after massive protests by public investors began in West Bengal. The company was asked by Sebi to refund the investors' money, among other strictures.Announcing the completion of its probe into the affairs of 14 companies of the Saradha Group of Companies, the SFIO said that this had come to be known as the 'Chit Fund Scam' and involved a number of schemes carrying unrealistic high rates of interest.However, these entities were not actually registered as chit funds. ""The investigation has concluded that schemes run by such companies were 'Ponzi Schemes' -- that is arrangements where the primary source of payment to subscribers is the collections made from newly enrolled members rather than from income generated from investments,"" it added.The SFIO has found serious financial mismanagement and siphoning off funds by promoters of various companies of Saradha group that were probed in this case.In May this year, the Supreme Court had handed over the Saradha chit fund scam probe to the CBI and asked the state governments to provide all logistical help to the CBI team investigating the matter.While there are allegations that some Trinamool Congress leaders are involved in the scam, the party recently said that the Chief Minister would support any unbiased investigation.Apart from 14 Saradha group firms, the SFIO had also probed entities from various other groups including Rose Valley, Icore E-Services and Sunshine India Land Developers.The Corporate Affairs Ministry, while ordering the SFIO probe last April, had said the decision was taken in view of the larger public interest involved in such cases, ""and concerns regarding misuse/laundering by such companies of the ill-gotten wealth and the possibility that the promoters of these companies may strip these companies"".Even though state governments are appropriate authorities for regulations of ""chit fund"" companies under the Chit Funds Act 1982, the MCA had ordered a probe in April after a huge public outcry over Saradha scam in West Bengal.Following the scam, efforts are being made to strengthen co-ordination between various agencies to curb ponzi schemes and safeguard the interests of investors.Regulatory agencies such as Sebi and the Reserve Bank and those under the MCA also launched media campaigns aimed at cautioning investors not to fall prey to fraudulent companies.With recent amendments to Sebi Act, the capital market watchdog has got more powers to crack down on fraudulent money pooling schemes. Among others, collective investment schemes worth Rs 100 crore or more are now under Sebi jurisdiction. Besides, Sebi has taken action against many entities for running unauthorised money pooling activities, having raised funds totalling to the tune of over Rs 1 lakh crore."

263,Potato supply still low,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140916/jsp/odisha/story_18839048.jsp,2014-09-16,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, Sept. 15: There has been no apparent improvement in the supply of potato to the state from Bengal though food and supplies minister Sanjay Das Burma claims that the situation has improved. The supply remains abysmally low as only 12 trucks came in the last two days when the daily requirement of potato for Bhubaneswar is 30 trucks. A local trader said that if the state government did not take any step, the situation would turn worse in next four to five days as the tuber might just vanish from the market. However, the officials in the food and supplies department sounded confident that the situation would become normal shortly. The state government had hoped that the undeclared ban on supply of potato from the neighbouring state would be lifted after Bengal chief minister Mamata Bannerjee met the agitating traders in her state on September 12. Odisha chief secretary had also written to his Bengal counterpart, seeking a lift on the ban. However, the situation has hardly improved since then. The wholesale price of potato in the state ranges between Rs 26 and Rs 28 per kilogram, while the retail price is above Rs 35 per kilogram. Though the state government has been selling 2kg potato to each person through the public distribution system outlets at Rs 20 per kg, the supply is not enough. District collectors have been told to control and monitor the sale of potato through the outlets. Sudhakar Panda, secretary of the Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha, said that though the traders had called off protest in Bengal, the supply had not become normal and a large number of potato-laden trucks had been detained at Lakshmannath check gate, which is the most prolific source of tuber supply. Today, 12 trucks from Bengal reached the city through other routes, while 10 trucks have come from our own cold storages, said Panda. There is hardly 3,000 metric tonnes of potato in the cold storage in Bhubaneswar, on which people of Nayagarh, Puri, Khurda and parts of Ganjam and Cuttack depend. The stock would last at the best for five days. We are hopeful that the situation will become normal and the government will do something to save the situation, said the traders. Officials in the food and supplies department expressed their helplessness in dealing with the situation. We waited for the traders in Bengal to call off their strike. Even our chief secretary had talked to his Bengal counterpart. Things are not in our hands, said an officer, blaming the Bengal governments undeclared ban on potato supply to Odisha for the shortage."
264,Live and let diet,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/jugglebandhi/live-and-let-diet/,2014-09-19,The Times Of India,"Food fads are making it increasingly difficult to have meals with friendsLike Bunny and me, perhaps you too are beginning to think twice before having people over for lunch or dinner. Soaring food prices of everything from tomatoes to tapioca, from potatoes to pumpkins, are part of the problem, but only part.The real problem is diets. Its likely that many, if not most, of the people you know, gender and age no bar, are on some sort of diet or other. To further complicate matters, everyones on a different diet from everyone else.In a middle-class India that, belatedly, is becoming health-conscious, diets are the latest fad, and going on a special, designer diet is even more fashionable than snapping selfies with your latest model, customised iPhone.Theres one diet, called the Atkins diet, in which people will eat only proteins (meat, fish, eggs) and veggies, but no cereals or carbs, as carbohydrates are referred to in dietese, the special language in which dieters speak to each other and to other people.Then there are people wholl eat all carbs, but wont eat wheat because wheat has gluten in it. There are diehard non-vegetarians who become vegetarian on certain days of the week, like Tuesday, or during certain phases of the moon. There are vegans who are not only pure veg but wont eat any animal products, like cheese or paneer, though food cooked in asli ghee is presumably exempt.Theres even something called the paleo diet, or cavemans diet, in which you are only allowed to eat what our prehistoric ancestors ate before they invented agriculture. So paleos will eat only meat (one Woolly Mammoth Butter Masala coming up), and berries, and other stuff that grows in the wild.If youre planning to have six people over to dinner, you might well find that you have to plan on serving not just six different dishes but six different dinner menus to suit the dietary requirements of your various guests. Make that seven different menus if one of your invitees is on a daily-changing diet which involves tossing a coin: heads, veggie; tails, caveman.The would-be host and hostess sit with pen and paper and try to work out the infinitesimal calculus of who will eat what, and who wont eat what. In the end, they give up the idea of having dinner guests and order in Chinese takeaway for one and home delivery pizza for the other, who has a dietary aversion to ajinomoto.Will diets spell the doom of the shared dinner table? Not at all. Theres one form of diet, popularised by the likes of Anna Hazare, thatll solve the problem. Its a special diet called fasting, so-called because the fast is exactly that: its so fast its over almost as soon as its begun.So instead of trying to plan multiple menus for their guests, the savvy host and hostess of the future will invite pals over for a fast feast. Everyone will get together for a couple of hours to observe a common fast during which nothing will be eaten or drunk.The fast feast will provide the perfect social evening, guaranteed to reduce both food bills and waistlines. And, best of all, friends can get together without worries that one day diet will do us part."
265,Soaring potato prices give Centre headache,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Soaring-potato-prices-give-Centre-headache/articleshow/43108329.cms,2014-09-22,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Increase in potato prices across the country except in some part of Karntaka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu seems giving tough time to government after it was successful to kept a check on onion prices and even tomato prices reducing significantly in the past one month.Potato prices in Delhi is now hovering around Rs 33 to Rs 40 per kg in different parts registering an increase of Rs 4-7 in comparison to last month. While in Mumbai the increase is around Rs 3-4 per kg, prices have gone up by Rs 5 in Agra, which is the hub of potato supply to entire north India and southern parts.Agra-based wholesalers said the prices will be somewhere near the present prices or may go up in the next one month. With the likely increase in demand of the key kitchen item during Navratra, when people fast in north India, they are expecting prices to soar further. After October when fresh crops from southern states start arriving there will be some correction. But the big relief will come in January when production from UP reaches mandis.UP alone meets about 45% on country's total potato demand.Meanwhile, comparison of wholesale prices shows that except in Chennai and Bangalore there has been an upward trend. While in Delhi per quintal increase is around Rs 600 in Mumbai it went up by only Rs 100.The wholesalers said that farmers and growers have been releasing the potato kept in cold storages in small quantity to get better price. Ravi Shankar Sharma, who owns RS Farmers & Suppliers, said the demand has increased while last year the production was less (about 6%). ""There is still 30% of the total production lying in cold storages, which people will release in the next 3-4 months till the fresh crop arrives. Best quality potatoes are going to south India,"" he said.Sharma added that during last harvest the prices never fell below Rs 1,400 per quintal and this trend may continue this year too. Another wholesaler Lala Kashiram said, ""This time Uttar Pradesh is meeting maximum demand of entire south India. So, when you have more requirement prices will increase,"" said potato wholesaler."
266,Shoestring chutzpah: â€˜They should say why their budgets are so highâ€™,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140925/jsp/nation/story_18870693.jsp,2014-09-25,Telegraph,"Isro officials celebrate the success of the mission in Bangalore on Wednesday. Bangalore News Photos New Delhi, Sept. 24: A combination of government salaries, shared resources and a unique equation Indias space agency has nurtured with domestic industry can explain how Indias Mars Orbiter Mission has cost less than some Hollywood movies. The Indian Space Research Organisation estimates that it has spent about Rs 450 crore ($74 million) on MOM, less than the $100-million budget of the 2013 Hollywood movie Gravity, and a fraction of the $230 million estimated to have gone into Avatar. Indias 50-year-old space programme has for decades run on budgets that are fractions of what the US or European space agencies have spent on the space enterprise. Isro spent an estimated Rs 4,880 crore ($800 million) during the financial year 2012-13, while the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget for 2013 was $17 billion and the European Space Agency budget for 2013 was $ 5.4 billion. But while those agencies that pioneered space exploration would be expected to have large spending during their learning curves, current and former Isro scientists say, Isros way of doing things has also helped it pursue projects on relatively low budgets. Its not just because of the differences in salaries, said Yagnaswami Sundara Rajan, a technology analyst and former official with the space agency. Weve also done things to optimise resources  for example, we cross-utilise components across different projects. Senior Isro officials recall instances where components or sub-systems developed for one project have been adapted or modified for a completely different project instead of trying to build a new component altogether. For instance, rocket motors used in launch vehicles have been adapted for use as thrusters on geosynchronous satellites. An alternative strategy could have been to develop a novel motor tailored for satellites, a senior official said. But that would cost more. This practice also increases reliability of sub-systems and reduces the risk, said Ved Prakash Sandlas, a former defence research scientist who was the project director of Isros first large satellite-ferrying vehicle called the Satellite Launch Vehicle-3. A unique technology development and transfer-to-industry mechanism established by Isro over the past five decades also helps reduce the cost of space missions, Sandlas said. Dozens of private and public sector industries provide the components and sub-systems that go into building satellites, spacecraft and launch vehicles  after obtaining the knowhow from Isros research laboratories. The industry makes them to Isros quality specifications, Sandlas said, and the participating industries have a dedicated customer in the space agency. The contractual and insurance requirements are simpler and lead to less costs than what you might see with other space agencies. We dont need to explain why our budgets are low  they (other space agencies) need to explain why their budgets are so high, said V. Siddhartha, a strategic technology analyst who had spent many years with Isro. Throughout its five-decade history, Isro scientists say, Indias space programme has run on frugal investments and resource optimisation to the extent that during one iconic instance in the early-1980s, a homegrown satellite was ferried a short distance on a bullock cart. Until about a decade ago, the space programme was almost exclusively focused on ground applications of space rather than the exploration of space itself. I can assert with confidence that no country in the world has made as good use of space for economic and social development as India, said Udupi Ramachandra Rao, a former chairman of Isro who led a team that selected the scientific payloads for the MOM spacecraft. When India first started firing experimental rockets into space from Thumba, a fishing village near Thiruvananthapuram, in the 1960s, some asked questions whether a country grappling with famines and widespread poverty could afford the luxury of pursuing a space programme. But the earliest architects of the space programme  Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan  had been clear about the goals the programme would set for itself  use space technology for economic and social development. We use space-based technologies in our daily lives so much, but it is not always appreciated, a senior Isro official said. Indias Earth-orbiting satellites facilitate telecommunications, bring television programmes into homes, forecast the weather, predict yields of rice, wheat and potato among other crops, ensure that banks money-dispensing machines reliably roll out cash, and guide fishermen to zones of the sea abundant in fish. Scientists say Isro began to contemplate missions exclusively for space exploration only about a decade ago amid feelings that Indias space programme had matured to a point where its engineers and scientists needed fresh challenges. The first such mission was Chandrayaan-1, a lunar orbiter launched in 2008. MOM represents Indias first planetary mission, but sections of Isro scientists have in academic papers outlined plans for a spacecraft fly-by to a comet or an asteroid within the next decade."

We are looking into two aspects like arrangement of seeds and strengthening of cold storage capacity in the state,"" chairperson of the taskforce and agriculture secretary Rajesh Verma said, adding the committee would recommend producing seeds within the state.""In order to make the state self-sufficient in potato production, we need at least 10 lakh quintal of seeds a year. It would not be possible for the state to import such huge amount of seeds,"" he said.While, the state's average annual requirement of potato is about 10 lakh tonne, it imports about 8 lakh tonne from West Bengal.The taskforce has also planned to liaison with international potato centre (CIP), Peru, National Seed Corporation, New Delhi, and National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation, Nasik, to increase the seed production in the state, official sources said.To strengthen the cold storage capacity in the state, it is in favour of attracting private investments. ""Unless the government assures a buffer stock to the cold storage owners, they would not be interested to augment their storage capacity. Government cannot develop all the cold storages of its own. The private investors have to be given subsidies to develop cold storages,"" he added.The other measures likely to be suggested by the taskforce are ensuring minimum support price and market linkage to the farmers.""We are in the process of fine-tuning the reports and it would be submitted to the government in next 15-20 days,"" Verma added.The taskforce would also send an expert team to Medinapore district of West Bengal to study the tuber production and storage management system.The taskforce, constituted on August 21, has been asked to prepare an action plan to make the state self-sufficient in production, procurement and distribution of potatoes within three years."

Similar trend was observed during the assembly polls when rates were reeling high but reduced after results were declared. Traders have attributed this price decrease to rise in supply and Congress has termed it as a political conspiracy.Onions, which were selling at Rs 30 per kilo (retail) before May 16 came down to Rs 15 per kg in a week's time. On Saturday, onions sold in the wholesale market at Muhana Mandi for Rs 8 per kg. Similarly, prices of seasonal vegetables like spinach and carrot have come down by Rs 10-15 per kg from the earlier price of Rs 30-40 per kg.Tomatoes, which were selling for anything between Rs 50-60 per kg, are now available for Rs 25 per kg in the retail market. Just a month ago, potatoes were selling at Rs 50 a kg and are now available for Rs 15-20 per kg in the retail market.The issue of decreasing prices has not gone down well with the Congress party. ""Increase in the vegetable prices was one of the strongest issues used by BJP to woo the voters during their election campaign. But suddenly it came down after the elections. This is something that needs to be probed,"" said former CM Ashok Gehlot after losing the assembly polls.A senior leader of Congress reiterated the stand of Gehlot and said, ""The trend suggests that there is a link. It certainly needs to be analyzed and proper action should be taken against those engaged in hoarding and black-marketing.""""New crop has started coming from states like Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. This has led to reduction in prices. Also vegetables from the local farms are available,"" said Radhey Shyam Phatak, president, Wholesaler Dealer Association.He refused of any link with the elections and added, ""Earlier the vegetables faced the brunt of erratic weather, which led to delay in the normal supply. Due to less availability in the market the rates shoot up. This may even happen now as soaring temperature will reduce the production."""

As the strike entered the second day on Thursday, agents stopped unloading of farm produce at the Gultekdi Market Yard.The APMC has, however, made alternative arrangements to unload fruits and vegetables and supply them to retailers. Sources said the retail market may face shortage if the strike continues for long, pushing up the prices in the process.The commission agents are opposed to the state government's move to introduce a new system (toli system) for appointment of workers for unloading of vegetables. Agents claim the decision was taken unilaterally and it will lead to chaos in the market.The market may not experience a sudden shortage of onions and potatoes as wholesalers generally hold stocks for up to 8 days. However, prices may rise on speculations.A retailer in Shivajinagar said that price of onion increased by Rs 10 per kg in the last two days. One kg onion was available at Rs 25 on Thursday as against Rs 15 two days back. The price hovered around Rs 20 to Rs 28 per kg in some parts of city on Thursday. Besides, the cost of other vegetables went up by about 10% in the retail market.Shivlal Bhosale, president of the association of commission agents, said, ""The government must understand that agents play a vital role in purchasing farm produce from farmers and supplying it to retailers.""A senior APMC official said, ""The APMC hardly has any role in the matter. It is initiating steps to make sure that vegetable reach the retail market every day.""Steps taken by maintain supply## Over 150-200 staff deployed to unload vegetables and sell to retailers## Over 2,000 quintal of vegetables unloaded on Thursday## APMC asks organized retailers to increase quantum## About 50 organized retailers in the city## About 150 to 200 farmers' groups supply vegetables in the city"
273,NHRC directs Bengal to supply potato to Odisha,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/nhrc-directs-bengal-to-supply-potato-to-odisha/article6474322.ece,2014-10-06,The Hindu,": In the wake of the potato shortage in Odisha in August, National Human Rights Commission has directed the West Bengal government to ensure the supply of potato to the neighbouring State.Acting on a complaint of Akhand, an Odisha-based rights activist, the Commission asked Chief Secretary of West Bengal to furnish a report on this within eight weeks.The activist had submitted that West Bengal government had put restrictions on the inter-state transportation of potato which disrupted the smooth supply of the tuber to Odisha in August.Potato-laden trucks from West Bengal were forced to be stranded at different check gates. With the West Bengal government restricting transportation of potato outside the State, it resulted in the sudden rise in price of potatoes in Odisha. People suffered at a time when Odisha was grappling with the floods, Mr. Akhand had stated.He said, Odisha is solely dependent on potato imports from Bengal. Odisha requires 912.859 thousand tonnes of potatoes per year while it produces not more than 201.05 thousand tonnes. The shortfall of 711.854 thousand tonnes is largely met with imports from outside, primarily West Bengal.Similarly, this year, the potato production in West Bengal was nearly Rs 95 lakh tonnes (1 crore tonnes as per government records). The 430 potato cold storages in the State could stock only 60 lakh tonnes. The remaining stocks have to be disposed of immediately, the activist maintained.He noted in his complaint: Potato was stocked in the cold storages in December and brought out in March. Between December and February, people have the new potato available in the market. There were 31 lakh tonnes of potato stocked in the cold storages. So there was no need to put restrictions on the transportation of potatoes to Odisha.But the West Bengal government intentionally did not supply the tuber to Odisha"", Mr. Akhand had alleged. Taking cognizance of the matter, the Commission directed the Chief Secretary of West Bengal to take immediate steps.Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had called Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee urging her for normalization of inter-state potato movements. Meanwhile, the supply of potato has been restored in the Odisha market."
274,Politics over potatoes strains kitchen budget,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Politics-over-potatoes-strains-kitchen-budget/articleshow/44532492.cms,2014-10-07,The Times Of India,"NAGPUR: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee's politics over potatoes has led to the prices of the kitchen staple shoot in Nagpur and other parts of the state. West Bengal, which supplies the commodity to eastern and southern parts of the country, had, over three months ago, banned its exports to other states. Banerjee's idea behind the move was to keep the rates low in her state. Even as the move was challenged, prices in West Bengal crashed indeed, only to make the commodity costlier elsewhere.Though the ban has been now relaxed by allowing a fixed quota to be sent to a few neighbouring states, supply of potatoes in several parts of the country continues to remain squeezed. Under normal circumstances, potatoes from Bengal reach up to Chhattisgarh which borders Vidarbha region. The ban meant that potatoes were sourced from Uttar Pradesh, the other major producing centre. This has kept the rates in regions like Vidarbha high.At Rs 35 to 40 a kg, the rates throughout the season have been double as compared to the same period last year, say traders.Neighbouring Chhattisgarh which consumes the Bengal potatoes is now entirely depending on supplies from UP, leading to a direct impact on Maharashtra. Fresh crop from UP will only arrive in December, and that from Karnataka which was expected by this time has not reached yet, said Jaiprakash Wasani of M/s Pankaj Traders at Kalamana Nagpur.Arup Roy, the minister for agriculture marketing in West Bengal, told TOI that his government's first priority was to ensure enough supply within the state. ""Currently, a quota of 1,000 tones a day each has been set for north and south Bengal regions to export in states like Odisha, Jharkhand and Assam. We want to ensure that there is enough supply within the state itself. Any further relaxation will be made looking at the stock position here,"" Roy told TOI over the phone.However, even as Roy maintained that farmers are getting a reasonable price despite the restrictions, traders say rates may soon crash in Bengal. According to Acento Debnayak of the Potato Traders Association, in his state, the rates are around Rs 16 a kg. But the market may end up with a glut if restrictions continue. He said the quota system put in place for exports has only led to corruption with permits being sold in the gray market for a premium.A trader at Raipur in Chhattisgarh said so the ban has led to rampant smuggling of potatoes from state's border. ""But that does not make it a feasible proposition as the cost of greasing the border authorities' palms increases the rates by at lest Rs 6 a kg,"" he said, on the condition of anonymity."

But if the state fails to resolve the conflict between the State Mathadi Union and wholesalers and agents by June 16, both have threatened an indefinite strike.Last week, the wholesalers and commission agents had stopped work at the Market Yard in protest against the government's June 1 resolution to form a 'toli' system for employing mathadi workers or head-loaders.The resolution required the head-loaders - responsible for unloading the produce in the market - to work in groups (toli) with each group working for multiple wholesalers. Right now, these workers are employed individually.While the State Mathadi Workers' Union is in favour of the new resolution, the commission agents and other workers at Market Yard are opposed to it.The strike by wholesalers and commission agents was called off after the government announced a stay on the order till June 16.The agitators want the order scrapped entirely. They have warned of an indefinite strike after June 16 if the order is not scrapped completely.""Head-loaders working in groups under a single boss will lead to malpractices. It is not good for our business and we oppose the growth of such culture,"" said Yuvraj Urse, a wholesaler. ""If the person unloading the produce is not from my shop, I won't be able to pin responsibility on anyone. I may get less quantity due to intentional or unintentional goof-up by workers,"" said another wholesaler.While the 'toli' or group system exists in Mumbai, workers in Pune say they still prefer the old system.""It is the difference of opinion between Narendra Patil-led State Mathadi Traders and the commission agents and workers under Hamal Panchayat which has led to the tension in the market,"" said an APMC official.While onion and potato sellers had gone on a strike on June 1, others - fruit, vegetables and paan traders - joined the agitation three days later on June 4. With shortage of fruits and vegetables in the market in Pune, prices of most products had jacked up last week.A vegetable and fruit seller from Pimpri Chinchwad said, ""The shortage was evident. Apples, for example, were being sold at Rs 220 per kg as against to earlier rate of Rs 150-200 per kg while oranges were sold at Rs 120/kg as opposed to Rs 80-Rs 100 per kg before the strike.""Prices of onion had gone up to Rs 35 per kg and that of potato had touched Rs 40 per kg from Rs 20 before. Most vegetables were sold at the rate of Rs 60 per kg or more.If the issue is not resolved by June 16, wholesalers and commission agents may go on an indefinite strike, which may lead to a shortage of fruits and vegetables once again."

I had gone to buy 2 kg of potato. But it had already vanished from the market.Whatever rotten potatoes were left were being sold at Rs 50 to 60 per kg. People were still buying. The rate of potato was Rs 24 per kg just a day ago, said Archana Sahu, a homemaker. The administration seemed to have not learnt any lessons from similar situations in the past as no official or police were seen in any of the markets to keep an eye on the hoarders .However, State Food Supplies and Consumer Affairs Secretary Madhu Sudan Padhi on Wednesday said that all district collectors had been directed to take stringent action against hoarders and shopkeepers indulging in black marketing.We have directed collectors to take the help of the police if necessary in this regard, the senior bureaucrat said. He also appealed to the people not to go for panic buying as essential goods were available in the state in plenty.There is no need to panic. People should go to market and buy things as they do everyday. They should not try to store anything extra in their homes. Panic buying will only encourage the hoarders and unscrupulous traders, Padhi said."
278,Modi's governance agenda: Diamond Quadrilateral of high speed trains,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Modis-governance-agenda-Diamond-Quadrilateral-of-high-speed-trains/articleshow/36320070.cms,2014-10-08,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: If the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government made Indian highways world class, the Narendra Modi government wants to replicate the success in the railways by building the Diamond Quadrilateral network for high speed trains.In fact, revamp of the creaky railway network is the government's top infrastructure agenda, which includes a massive public-private partnership (PPP) push. The statement comes at a time when passengers have come to associate the railways with all that is bad  from dirty stations to several accidents and long delays.But more than just upgrading the current service quality, the government wants to make the railways a key element of the logistics hub that will make the economy more competitive. So, if the proposed high speed corridors, which has been on the drawing board for close to a decade, will provide faster connectivity, there is also a plan to have a network of freight corridors.Apart from coal and steel using the corridor, there is also a plan for specialized agri-rail networks for perishable agricultural products that will move potatoes or tomatoes from a surplus part of the country to one which has deficiency and help the government tame prices. Again, this is not a proposal that has been made for the first time as similar plans have been discussed in the past but the key for the government will be to execute it.Although former railway minister Madhavrao Scindia had first mooted the idea of high speed trains in the mid-eighties, railways came out with a white-paper in December 2009. So far, six stretches have been identified and feasibility study of Mumbai-Ahmadabad corridor is underway.Similarly, former railway minister Lalu Prasad had announced encouraging higher level of movement of milk by tankers from various regions of the country besides introducing more refrigerated parcel vans for transportation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable commodities.The statements come at a time when the government is also looking to allow FDI in certain segments of railways, such as high speed corridors, to ensure that the weak finances of the Indian Railways does not block any attempt to modernize a network that has largely been inherited from the British rulers.The government, however, said that investment in railways will be increased using innovative financing methods and the network will be expanded to the hilly states and the northeast.Apart from the railways, the President's speech suggested that there will be a push to low cost airports to promote connectivity to small cities, revival of the ""Sagar Mala"" project to connect ports with hinterland through road and rail, time-bound and well monitored highway development programme and development of inland and coastal waterways have been identified as major focus area to pus h infrastructure development.Realizing it well that government funding will be inadequate and the private investment won't come unless there is conducive environment, Mukherjee said, ""A fast-track, investment friendly and predictable PPP mechanism will be put in place.""The government also committed to evolve a model of port-led development and making the long coastline as ""gateway for India's prosperity"" by modernizing the existing ports and developing new world class ones."

Over the past fortnight, the retail price of onion and potato have risen by Rs 5-6 from Rs 18-20 to Rs 24-26 per kg. Experts say the loss caused by the recent hailstorm is marginal, and need not drive prices inordinately high.Traders at Vashi wholesale market have assured consumers that rates will not spiral further as there are ample stocks to last all of India for the next four or five months.In a refreshing departure from previous precedent, the new government at the Centre has decided to pre-empt a price rise. Sources said the government has identified onions, along with non-basmati rice, pulses, potatoes and milk, as products that need intense monitoring in the coming months. This may lead to a check in the export of the politically-sensitive onions.The government has comfortable stocks of grains, potato and onion at the moment, officials said. Still, onion exports will once again be subject to a minimum export price, higher than the prevailing market price, to discourage outbound shipments of the key kitchen ingredient.The cabinet secretary will also take stock of the situation every fortnight, as compared to a monthly review of prices during the previous regime.A leading onion trader at APMC, Vashi, Sanjay Pingle agreed, ""There is no reason for panic buying because there is no shortage of produce. It is not unusual for onion and potato to sell for Rs 15-20 per kg in the wholesale market. Farmers are holding stocks owing to the delayed monsoon, perhaps hoping to release them for a better price later. But the new government at the Centre just stated on Monday that controlling food prices is its priority. It has promised to crack down on hoarders and profiteers so that will serve as a deterrent to unscrupulous farmers and traders.""On Tuesday, neighbourhood vendors in Byculla, Andheri and Bandra were selling potato for Rs 24-26 per kg while the price of onion stood at Rs 24 in most places. The roots normally come for Rs 15-18, and peak at Rs 20-22 at the peak of summer.Yet, some traders tried to explain how this was not a seasonal variation. Vashi supplier Ram Ashray Gupta said the freak hailstorm of March had caused onion crops to spoil during harvesting season. ""Around 35% of the onion harvest became wet and soggy. Potato has also been slow to arrive from Agra, UP, Gujarat as well as Bengal,"" he said. Pingle, however, denied that the hailstorm would impact the supplies in a big way.The ghost of 80-rupee onions is fresh in the mind of every consumer, who has become wary of the cyclical peak. Experts say repeat speculation over shortage of produce by those in authority does not help matters, and this time, the prediction of a below average monsoon may have contributed to the hike as well.The government is taking no chances, given the possible adverse fallout of a price rise. The consumer affairs ministry has dashed off letters to state governments asking them to identify hoarders.""The government needs to think three-four months in advance for any political action to be effective. If domestic supplies of food products suffer (due to weak rains), the only way out is to import,"" said agriculture economist Ashok Gulati said."

The evacuation process will be over on Friday night itself, said Odisha revenue minister SN Patro. He said the government had two primary tasks  to evacuate people before the cyclone hits them and to immediately reopen roads and communication networks by clearing uprooted trees afterwards with the help of state and central disaster relief forces to enable smooth supply of essential commodities.Personnel of the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Indian Navy have been deployed in vital places in the affected districts. Besides the 280 multi-purpose cyclone shelters in the districts, the state government has converted about 10,000 concrete schools as temporary cyclone shelters to house evacuated people, special relief commissioner PK Mohapatra said.The Andhra Pradesh government put all five northern coastal districts -- Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, east Godavari and west Godavari -- on high alert and placed rescue teams and monitoring mechanisms in place.Evacuation of people in low lying areas began in Srikakulam on Friday. An estimated 64,000 people have to be evacuated and moved to safer places in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam.In all these three districts, NDRF personnel are already in position to assist the civil administration in relief and rescue operations. Expert swimmers, boats, civil supplies and medicines have been moved to these locations.Puri residents are sure their town would be spared the fury of cyclone Phailin when it is feared to make a landfall some time on Saturday evening.Their belief in divine intervention stems from the 1999 super cyclone that spared the temple town while ravaging its adjoining areas.Other areas in coastal Odisha, however, have no such hope even as they continuously pray to Goddess Durga, the presiding deity of the ongoing Navratra festival.Even while doing so, they continue to shop and stock essential items.In 1999, we starved for days as there was no food. This time I want to stock food for at least seven days, said Nirakar Dasmohapatra of Ganjam district, which is among the most vulnerable.Dry food, candles, match boxes and soaps went off the shelf in coastal districts of Odisha as well as state capital Bhubaneswar. So did potatoes, tomatoes and onion, even as chief minister Naveen Patnaik warned of strict action against hoarders.Supply department officials seized several bags of potatoes in Nayagarh district while 300 bags of wheat were seized from a place in Ganjam district.But traders made a killing selling vegetables at exorbitant prices and hoarding essential items. Potato prices shot up to Rs 50 per kg and chuda (crushed rice) cost more than double at Rs 60.Even big malls in Bhubaneswar hiked food stuff prices.

282,Govt may check onion export to curb price rise,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Govt-may-check-onion-export-to-curb-price-rise/articleshow/36364603.cms,2014-10-09,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Export of politically-sensitive onions is expected to face the first set of checks as expectations of weak monsoon rains have prompted the government to begin work on keeping food inflation under control.Sources said the government has identified onions, along with non-basmati rice, pulses, potatoes and milk as products that need intense monitoring given the possibility of a spike in prices in the coming months. Over the weekend, cabinet secretary Ajit Seth met officials from the food and consumer affairs, agriculture, finance and commerce and industry ministries to take stock of the price situation.Since the government has comfortable stocks of grains, potato and onion at the moment, monitoring will be crucial so that supplies can be directed towards critical zones, officials said. Even then, onion exports will once again be subject to a minimum export price, which will be higher than the prevailing market price, to discourage outbound shipments of the key kitchen ingredient. Already, prices of onions used as seed have more than doubled over the past few weeks, market sources said.Weak rains may hit western states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan the most as northern states have an irrigation network to depend on. As a result, production of cotton and some oilseeds may be affected. The other fallout could be on onions as the new crop hits the market in October. Weak rains will delay, if not reduce, arrivals, resulting in a spike as was seen last year, although it was on account of heavy rains in parts of Maharashtra.""Indian rainfall forecast worsens. Government should start counting onions lest it is hit by a surprise in Oct-Nov,"" tweeted agriculture economist Ashok Gulati.The government is taking no chances, given the possible adverse fallout. The consumer affairs ministry has dashed off letters to state governments asking them to identify hoarders for effective crack down. The worry stems from onions as the wholesale price is around Rs 13 a kg, while the retail price is Rs 22-23 a kg.The agriculture ministry has also informed the cabinet secretariat that area under cultivation for pulses has come down, resulting in the possibility of higher imports, especially of moong daal.Milk is the other area of concern, where prices have increased by Rs 4 a litre over the past 12 months. Experts suggested that the government could respond by reducing the import duty on skimmed milk powder from the current level of 60% to signal lower prices.In case of grains, the government has sufficient stock although there has been an increase in recent months despite stocks of 69.4 million with the Food Corporation of India. This included rice and paddy stocks of close to 28 million tones. Sources indicated the price issue will be addressed by releasing more stocks into the market. According to official data the average wholesale price of rice has increased to Rs 2877 per quintal, roughly Rs 29 a kg, compared to Rs 2,719 a year ago  an increase of a little under 6%.""The government needs to think three-four months in advance for any political action to be effective. If domestic supplies of food products suffer (due to weak rains), the only way out is to import. Import duty can be slashed for certain products and can be increased, when the crisis gets over,"" Gulati said, when contacted over the phone.Madan Sabhnavis, chief economist at ratings agency Care, too suggested that higher imports could help but warned against initiating measures too soon. ""What if the monsoon is normal? You will be saddled with the stock,"" he saidBut the government is on high alert, with the cabinet secretary scheduled to take stock of the situation every fortnight, compared to a monthly review of prices so far."

Following the Met Office prediction, prices of essential commodities like vegetables, candles and grocery too skyrocketed.The price of potato at Unit-I market almost doubled in a day. While the tuber was being sold at Rs 24 a kg on Tuesday, it now costs Rs 50-Rs 60.""We are not getting potato from West Bengal traders as people are buying the tuber even before the trucks enter the city. There is absolutely no potato in the market,"" president of Unit-I haat association Gayadhar Swain told TOI.""If people purchase commodities for two to three days then there will be enough stock for everyone. But most consumers are stocking items for at least a month,"" said secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Sangha Sudhakar Panda.There was also scarcity of other commodities, including flattened rice, noodles, biscuits and candles.With the cyclone expected to cross east coast between Visakhapatnam and Gopalpur on October 12, people in large numbers thronged retail outlets, daily markets, drug and grocery shops. The ATM counters and filling stations also witnessed mad rush.Food supplies and consumer welfare secretary M S Padhi urged people not to resort to panic buying. ""We have directed collectors to check hoarding by unscrupulous traders. Police and market intelligence wing would also help the squads crack down on hoarders,"" Padhi said."
284,Cyclone threat prompts panic buying,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1141009/jsp/odisha/story_18907402.jsp,2014-10-09,Telegraph,"People buy vegetables and essential commodities at a market in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday. Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Oct. 8: The state administration has instructed all district authorities to keep tabs on stocking of essential commodities and panic buying with the impending threat of cyclone. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted that cyclone Hudhud in the Bay of Bengal will transform into a severe cyclonic storm within the next 24 hours. The cyclone prediction has also led to panic buying of essential commodities and vegetables by public. Although the cyclone is predicted to hit south Odisha, people have already started buying stuff in other parts of the state as well. When I came to the market today, I found potato and other essential commodities already sold out. Whatever was available was sold at a higher price. Currently potato is selling at Rs 35 to Rs 40 per kg, said Muktikant Mohanty, a resident of Baramunda. Food supplies and consumer welfare (FSCW) secretary Madhusudan Padhee appealed to people not to resort to panic buying. He said the state had enough food stocked for people and they should avoid purchasing items in a huge quantity. We have kept enough rice, kerosene, potato, onion, sugar, pulses and other items ready. People should not purchase for months, as that will help dishonest traders to resort to hoarding. Besides, the district collectors have been told to keep tabs on the arrangements and ensure there is no hoarding by local traders. If need be, they have been told to take the help of police, said Padhee. Khurda collector Niranjan Sahu said: Strict action has already been initiated by the district administration. Two truckloads of potatoes were seized by the district officials. The seized items will be sold at government rate at Maitree outlets opened by the FSCW department. Officials of the department today carried out two rounds of checks at Ainginia where the cold storages of the city are located. In a day Bhubaneswar needs 35 to 40 truckloads of potatoes. However, people themselves are going to Ainginia and demanding potato before the trucks are offloaded. This is affecting the law and order situation and therefore the truck operators are forced to divert their supplies to other places, said additional civil supplies officer Subodha Mallick. Mallick said that yesterday 40 truckloads of potatoes came to Ainginia, but today only six truckloads came as the peoples presence inside the godown complex forced the suppliers to divert their vehicles. Last year during Phailin, people also resorted to similar practice and it caused a crisis of supply in the godown. City police officials today raided the potato storage facilities in the daily markets of Unit I and IV to avoid hoarding of essential commodities. The peoples tendency to panic buying has also inspired many unscrupulous traders to resort to hoarding. The Bhubaneswar and Cuttack Municipal Corporations have also been asked to be prepared to face the challenges in these two cities during the cyclone. It has been decided to deploy 150 motor pumps to ensure fast clearance of rain and waste water to prevent acute water logging conditions, said municipal commissioner Gyana Das. All the motor pumps will be deployed at several low-lying areas as well as on various main storm water channels in the city from tomorrow."

Over the past fortnight, the retail price of onion and potato have risen by Rs 5-6 from Rs 18-20 to Rs 24-26 per kg. Experts say the loss caused by the recent hailstorm is marginal, and need not drive prices inordinately high.Traders at Vashi wholesale market have assured consumers that rates will not spiral further as there are ample stocks to last all of India for the next four or five months.In a refreshing departure from previous precedent, the new government at the Centre has decided to pre-empt a price rise. Sources said the government has identified onions, along with non-basmati rice, pulses, potatoes and milk, as products that need intense monitoring in the coming months. This may lead to a check in the export of the politically-sensitive onions.The government has comfortable stocks of grains, potato and onion at the moment, officials said. Still, onion exports will once again be subject to a minimum export price, higher than the prevailing market price, to discourage outbound shipments of the key kitchen ingredient.The Cabinet secretary will also take stock of the situation every fortnight, as compared to a monthly review of prices during the previous regime.A leading onion trader at APMC, Vashi, Sanjay Pingle agreed, ""There is no reason for panic buying because there is no shortage of produce. It is not unusual for onion and potato to sell for Rs 15-20 per kg in the wholesale market. Farmers are holding stocks owing to the delayed monsoon, perhaps hoping to release them for a better price later. But the new government at the Centre just stated on Monday that controlling food prices is its priority. It has promised to crack down on hoarders and profiteers so that will serve as a deterrent to unscrupulous farmers and traders.""On Tuesday, neighbourhood vendors in Byculla, Andheri and Bandra were selling potato for Rs 24-26 per kg while the price of onion stood at Rs 24 in most places. The roots normally come for Rs 15-18, and peak at Rs 20-22 at the peak of summer.Yet, some traders tried to explain how this was not a seasonal variation. Vashi supplier Ram Ashray Gupta said the freak hailstorm of March had caused onion crops to spoil during harvesting season. ""Around 35% of the onion harvest became wet and soggy. Potato has also been slow to arrive from Agra, UP, Gujarat as well as Bengal,"" he said. Pingle, however, denied that the hailstorm would impact the supplies in a big way.The ghost of Rs 80 onions is fresh in the mind of every consumer, who has become wary of the cyclical peak. Experts say repeat speculation over shortage of produce by those in authority does not help matters, and this time, the prediction of a below average monsoon may have contributed to the hike as well.The government is taking no chances, given the possible adverse fallout of a price rise. The consumer affairs ministry has dashed off letters to state governments asking them to identify hoarders.""The government needs to think three-four months in advance for any political action to be effective. If domestic supplies of food products suffer (due to weak rains), the only way out is to import,"" said agriculture economist Ashok Gulati said."

The rains have also affected the quality of onions.""Stocks of onions are available but they are getting spoiled,"" manager of Ponda-based KK Traders, wholesalers and retailers of vegetables said.""The price of onions will not fall but it will surely increase,"" another Ponda trader said.While prices of onions, potatoes and tomatoes in the Panaji market were Rs 30 a kg, onions sold at Goa state horticulture corporation (GSHC) kiosks at Rs 20-22 per kg.GSHC managing director Orlando Rodrigues said prices of all vegetables increase before the monsoon but the current rise in onion prices was due to shortage caused by untimely rains.""Thanks to heavy and continuous rains, farmers could not dry the onion yield harvested. Onion farmers have suffered heavily,"" Rodrigues said. If not for the rains, onion prices would have dropped below Rs 10 per kg, he pointed out.Wholesale traders are of opinion that onion prices will stabilize, probably when a fresh crop of onion enters the market after the monsoon."

Any disruption in supply of potato for a day because of Hudhud will have no significant impact on the market,"" said secretary of Chhatra Bazaar Vegetable Traders' Association Debendra Sahu.The improving market situation has come as a relief for the state government.

The department is of the view that Central laws have to be enforced strictly by states. Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have done much better than others and their models can be followed, sources added.As per price monitoring cell data of consumer affairs ministry, the average price of rice increased to Rs 30 per kg in June against Rs 29 in the previous month.

The memory of Phailin still fresh in their minds, most residents stayed indoors. Roads wore a deserted look since morning. There was not much traffic even on the NH-5 and NH-230. Shopping malls, eateries, cinemas and multiplexes remained closed. There were occasional disruptions of power and water supply. Some Lakshmi puja pandals were damaged. Shutdown syndrome Mrutyunjay Tripathy, a resident of Soubhagya Nagar, said: There was no major impact of the cyclone on the city. But with markets and eateries remaining closed, people, especially students, faced problems. Swagat Kar, head of a leading online ticketing agency, said: All cinemas remained closed today. Inox, the multiplex located at the BMC-Bhawani Mall, also downed shutters. Before the cyclone struck, vegetable prices had soared because people had indulged in panic buying but rates in neighbourhood shops came down today with potato selling for Rs 30-a-kg as compared to Rs 35 to Rs 40 just two days ago. Stranded While three flights were cancelled and one re-routed from Biju Patnaik International Airport, the railway station and bus terminals wore a deserted look. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) cancelled flights that were to pass over the Bay of Bengal, close to the path of Hudhud. While two flights of Indigo on the Calcutta-Bhubaneswar-Visakhapatnam-Chennai sector and one in the New Delhi-Bhubaneswar-Port Blair sector of Air India were cancelled, the Bhubaneswar-Visakhapatnam-Bangalore flight of Indigo was re-routed directly to Bangalore. Airport director Sharad Kumar said the radar station near Berhampur were equipped with an advanced gadget because it transmitted information to high-altitude flights and sends data to Calcutta, Mumbai and Delhi airports. The East Coast Railway (EcoR) cancelled 25 trains, diverted 27 and short terminated seven trains owing to the cyclone. ECoR chief public relations officer J.P. Mishra said: The much sought-after Prashanti Express to Bangalore will be diverted via Sambalpur, Raipur and Nagpur. Arrangements had been made so that not a single passenger suffered while travelling and those who want refund will get back their money without any hassles. Passengers were also stranded at the citys Baramunda bus stand as vehicles went off the roads. Many buses, which were plying to areas not affected by the cyclone, however, were seen charging extra money from passengers. Waterworld While majority of the city roads remained deserted since early morning, several others went underwater by afternoon. Major roads near Acharya Vihar and Jaydev Vihar remained waterlogged. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) monitored the situation through its 24X7 helpline. It deployed jet pumps at Hanspal, Sriram City near GGP Colony and Narayani Club in the Old Bhubaneswar area to avoid waterlogging. It kept three bulldozers, three tippers, five jet pumps and seven water tankers ready to meet any emergency. As street lights did not function, the roads remained dark in the night.

Similarly, carrots cost Rs 48Rs 58, presently, as against Rs 40 a couple of days back.Leafy vegetables such as coriander, methi and spinach are also affected and their rates have increased by Rs 20 to Rs 25. Earlier, they were priced between Rs 8 to Rs 15 per bunch, now they cost Rs 30 to Rs 35 in wholesale markets.The reason behind this price rise is the crop destruction because of rains, said R V Gopi, president of the Wholesale Vegetable Merchants Association. He said that the fluctuation in vegetable rates is throughout the State and not just in Bangalore.Yele Srinivas of the KR Puram Market Association maintained that whenever there is incessant rain, prices of vegetables, sometimes even fruits, increase.The leafy crops are delicate and get damaged easily. They take at least a month to grow back and give yield. The prices may remain unchanged for a month, he said.At the Gandhi Bazaar market, vegetables were priced higher by vendors when compared to wholesalers. Madhu G, a vendor, attributed the increase in rate to high transportation and coolie charges.Shortage of supplyH K Nagaveni, president, Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society Limited (Hopcoms), told Deccan Herald that another problem haunting vegetable dealers and Hopcoms was shortage of supply.The spinach produce is hit majorly as sufficient quantity is not arriving in the market. Since the water content is high in spinach, it gets easily destroyed.However, much to the relief of consumers, prices of fruits have not increased."

297,Food inflation worries far from over,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Food-inflation-worries-far-from-over/articleshow/36628542.cms,2014-10-14,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Moderation in inflation numbers may have provided some short-term relief for the Narendra Modi administration as it launches its act to revive the economy. But challenges on the inflation front are far from over and there are looming worries over prices, which could act as an obstacle for the BJP-led government's roadmap to help put the economy back on track.While Modi has made it clear that tough decisions are needed to restore the health of government finances and revive the economy, he will need to focus on a clear strategy to tame food inflation, which has remained a challenge for the past three to four years. This would require both short-term and long-term measures to improve supplies and create both back-end and front-end infrastructure in the farm sector to tackle the problem head on. This would be an uphill task and the government will have to bring states on board to revamp laws, which hinder movement of farm supplies.The latest retail inflation data showed some moderation but the consumer food price inflation hovered around double digits at 9.6% year-on-year in May. Price increase rates for fruits, egg, fish, meat, milk, milk products and vegetables were in double digits. Prices of potatoes and onions have started firming up and during monsoons vegetable prices spike due to supply obstacles.According to Ashok Gulati, professor at ICRIER, the consumer food price index has averaged 11.5% for the past three years, which highlighted the stress in food prices. ""Liquidate some of the excess stock, urgently reform the APMC Act to ensure stable supplies,"" Gulati said. For the short term, the government could also examine reducing import tariff on some food items. For instance, import tariff on chicken legs is pegged at 100%, skimmed milk powder 60%, apple 50% and garlic 100%.For the long term, massive investments would be needed to create the infrastructure to ensure stable supplies. For this, the government will need to attract private investments and, according to Gulati, incentives such as tax holidays may have to be worked out.The immediate challenge confronting the government is the prospect of patchy monsoon rains due to the El-Nino weather phenomena. While it is too early to predict the outcome of the Southwest monsoon, early estimates show that it would be below normal. This would require steps to ensure supplies, fodder and relief for farmers. Fortunately, the government has enough food grain stocks to deal with the situation.Former RBI governor Bimal Jalan said taming inflation would also require keeping a check on the fiscal deficit. ""There is a soft side and hard side to revive the economy,"" he said.Economists say the Reserve Bank of India may not ease interest rates soon as it will prefer to watch the government policy action in the Budget and the movement in monsoon rains.?""If rains are normal, CPI inflation should come off to 7-7.5% by March 2015. If the El Nino impacts the kharif harvest, rising food prices will push up CPI inflation to 8-10%, pretty much irrespective of monetary policy action. A 5% change in food prices impacts CPI inflation by 250 basis points. This will likely to push back RBI rate cuts to early 2015,"" said Indranil Sengupta, economist at BofA Merrill Lynch, in a research report."

The favourable base effect of last year has also benefited the WPI.The WPI-based inflation was at 3.74 per cent in August and 7.05 per cent in September, 2013.As per data released by the government on Tuesday, food inflation fell to a nearly 33-month low of 3.52 per cent. The sharp drop in WPI inflation, which fell for the fourth month in a row, comes close on the heels of retail inflation declining to a record low of 6.46 per cent in September.Wholesale inflation in onion contracted to 58.12 per cent in September as compared to a contraction of 44.7 per cent in the previous month. While inflation in the vegetable basket as a whole shrunk to 14.98 per cent in September, the rate of price rise in potato was at 90.23 per cent against 61.61 per cent in the previous month.WPI inflation in the fuel and power segment, which includes LPG, petrol and diesel, declined to 1.33 per cent as compared to a price rise of 4.54 per cent in August.Commenting on the data, industry body Confederation of Indian Industry Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said, Going forward, the downslide in global commodity prices led by fuel together with improved monsoon conditions and favourable policy interventions should help contain inflation and prevent prices from resuming its inflationary tendency anytime soon.He added the prices of manufacturing goods had also declined, indicating a favourable impact on core inflation.Inflation in milk, eggs, meat and fish continued to decline in September as well. However, there was slight increase in the prices of fruits during the period.Inflation in manufactured products such as sugar, edible oils, beverages and cement also fell, declining to 2.84 per cent in September as against 3.45 per cent in the previous month.Industry chamber PHDCCI said it expected a softening policy stance from the Reserve Bank of India in the coming times. We believe a cut in repo rate would be inevitable to revive industrial growth and demand to pick up pace. Revival of demand scenario would pave the way for revival of investment sentiment, it said.The RBI, which maintained status quo in the interest rate since January, will come out the monetary policy review on December 2.Diesel and petrol prices are likely to come down in the wake of sliding global crude prices, which is expected to further ease inflationary pressure.The RBI primarily factors in Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation while framing monetary policy. It is targeting 8 per cent retail inflation by January, 2015, and 6 per cent by January, 2016.Meanwhile, wholesale inflation based on final index for July has been revised upwards to 5.41 per cent from the provisional estimate of 5.19 per cent.The build up inflation rate in the financial year till September was at 2.61 per cent compared to a build up rate of 6.23 per cent in the same period of 2013-14."

Finance minister Arun Jaitley said the moderation in vegetable and other food item prices was due to steps taken by the government and hoped that the new monetary policy framework will help cool prices.""We are committed to continuing reforms in food markets that will improve supply responses and keep inflation low and stable. At the same time, fiscal consolidation and a new monetary policy framework will help bring down inflationary expectations. We are confident that soon we will be achieving a low and stable inflation rate,"" Jaitley said in a statement.""The sharp moderation in inflation has been a culmination of a favourable base effect, moderation in food prices, softening crude oil prices and weak growth,"" said Upasana Bhardwaj, economist at ING Vysya Bank.""Overall, while the subsequent figures are further likely to ease, we expect RBI to hold on to its policy rates this year. Going into next year, we expect RBI to assess the diminishing upside risks to its 6% target closely and press the trigger only when it is convinced of a meaningful correction in prices,"" she said.Food inflation which had emerged as a major policy headache eased to an annual 3.52% in September slowing from near double digit rates in May. Prices of vegetables declined an annual 15% in September while onion prices dropped 58.12%. Potato prices still remained stubborn rising 90.2% year-on-year in September. Milk, milk products and fruit prices hovered over double digits, highlighting the fact that prices pressures could return.The RBI has been cautioning about the stubborn inflationary pressures in the economy. The authorities are working on a new monetary policy framework which is expected to kick in next year.While the government would prefer easing of interest rates to boost growth, economist say the RBI may prefer to wait for more evidence of prices stabilising before easing rates.""We expect average CPI & WPI to trend towards 6.2% and 4.5% in FY16,"" said Rohini Malkani, India economist at Citigroup, India.""While the RBI maintains its view of an upside risk to its 6% CPI target (albeit lower in Sept policy), we believe that the upside risks have subsided materially given the benign outlook on global commodities, stable trends in INR, drop in core CPI momentum and continued supply-side efforts to contain food inflation. As a result, we reiterate our view that the window to ease rates could open up in 2015,"" she said."

302,Shower havoc on potato fields,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1141016/jsp/bihar/story_18928865.jsp,2014-10-16,Telegraph,"Strong winds blow in Patna after Hudhud reached the state. Telegraph picture Two hours of incessant rain owing to the impact of cyclone Hudhud on Tuesday night has laid waste to potato fields, leaving tillers in the lurch. The period of sowing has lapsed and untimely showers have only added to their misery. Krityanand Nagar resident Vinay Yadav said: Heavy rainfall on Tuesday night has destroyed the sown potatoes and we are bound to incur a loss of about 60-70 per cent of the cultivation. The plants would dry up after waterlogging and the seeds would rot. Yadav had sown potatoes in six acres as compared to last years 10 acres owing to the high price of potato seeds and cultivation. He had purchased a 50kg bag of potatoes at Rs 2,100, while he sowed about 22-24 bags in each acre. Now, we would not be able to sow potatoes this year as time of planting has lapsed and it is financially not feasible to cultivate again,  he added. District agriculture officer Indrajeet Prasad Singh told The Telegraph: We had warned the farmers about cyclone Hudhud causing heavy rainfall. We had also asked tillers to start potato farming after October 16. But several farmers had already sown potatoes in land. They have been hit hard. However, the rain only damaged fields in low-lying areas. Singh added: The farmers in Purnea cultivate potatoes on around 10,000 hectares. They grow potato in two seasons  September to December and January to April. Since they get better returns in the first season, the tillers went ahead with the cultivation despite the weather warning. Mohammad Manzar, a resident of Dhamdaha, said: We finished sowing and have already spent between Rs 50,000 and Rs 55,000 on each acre of land. But the showers have damaged our plants. As time has lapsed for potato cultivation and we are short of money, we have decided to sow maize. Although potato cultivation is more profitable than maize, we have no choice. We produce around 100 quintals of potato in each acre and it is a cash crop. A cash crop is harvested for commercial value rather than use by the grower. Potential potato growing blocks of the district lie in Dhamdaha, Krityanand Nagar, Banmankhi and Sarsi."

This has been attributed to rising temperatures which reduced the shelf life of the vegetables leading to less supply and rise in prices. Vegetable vendors said there will hardly be a respite for the common man till the monsoon.Since last week, the price of onion and tomatoes has skyrocketed. The city is now facing shortage of onions in the market due to delay in supplies from Nasik and surrounding areas. The price of onions has jumped from Rs 8-10 per kilo to Rs 18-22 in the last one week.Similarly, the price of potatoes has risen from Rs 8 per kilo Rs 12 per kilo in the retail market and tomatoes which were available at a price of Rs 5 to Rs 8 per kilogram is now selling in the market at Rs 10. The price of veggies in the city varies from the market to market with posh localities having to pay Rs 2 to Rs 3 extra.Cucumber which is used in salads was sold at Rs 10 per kilogram two weeks ago but has now reached Rs 35 per kg. Lady finger is now available at Rs 35-Rs 40 per kg as against Rs 25 per kilogram recently. Seasonal vegetables like beans and taro which have just hit the market are available at Rs 30 per kilogram as against Rs 15 last year, vendors said.Ramkishen, a vegetable vendor at Lal Kothi, said the high temperatures have caused the price rise and added, ""The shelf life of some veggies has been reduced to a day or two. In the absence of cold storage, vendors are incurring heavy losses due to rotten vegetables. The rise in price of vegetables has become an every year phenomena during this period. Despite the absence of any festive season, the price rise in the market is beyond my understanding. Even after paying a hefty price, we are getting poor quality of vegetables from the wholesalers.""Traders said declining farm area for vegetables in the surrounding areas have also added to the price woes. Ramkisen said nearly 60% of the vegetables in the state arrive from outside Rajasthan and make the veggies' market here very volatile. A major chunk of the veggies in Jaipur comes from Chomu. Other places like Amber have exhausted or have turned into concrete jungles."

We will import pulses, if there is a shortage. Cereals and edible oil can be imported if states feel there is a shortage,"" finance minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after a meeting with his Cabinet colleaguesThough the government is monitoring the price movement of 22 commodities, a spurt has been noticed in four-five food products. The government's move to announce the steps is aimed at managing prices before they start spiraling and have political implications.The UPA government was often blamed for its slow response, propelling inflation into a key election issue. The Narendra Modi government's response has been quick and came a day after data showed that potato and other food prices had driven inflation past the 6% mark for the first time since December. It has repeatedly said it intends to focus on keeping inflation under control.Fears of weak monsoon and its adverse impact on food production are driving up prices, especially of vegetables. In addition, the violence in Iraq has triggered fears of a spike in oil prices, which can push up inflation further.While the government imposed a minimum export price of $300 a tonne on onions to discourage shipments out of the country, a similar levy on potatoes will be initiated by the commerce department, Jaitley said.On June 11, TOI was the first to report that the government was going to impose a minimum export price to augment supplies in the domestic market even as it was tracking the prices of potatoes, non-basmati rice and skimmed milk powder.The finance minister said states have been asked to delist certain items, which are usually procured through Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees, so that they come into the open market. Delhi lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung has been asked to procure onions and potatoes from the open market and ensure abundant supplies through Mother Dairy retail outlets. He has also been asked to delist all food items in the capital, a move that will enable farmers to sell their produce directly to the market.Similarly, 50 lakh tonnes of rice will be released in the open market through state governments to cool prices. Food Corporation of India has abundant stocks but has in the past been accused of holding on to rice and wheat, even as prices soared in the local market.With regard to pulses and edible oil, states will be given a line of credit to directly import them to meet local demand, Jaitley said.""The meeting also reviewed the steady increase in retail price of milk and decided to consider withholding export incentives, currently in force,"" an official statement said."

On June 17, potato and onion both cost Rs 26-29 per kg in Mumbai, up from Rs 16-20 on May 26 when the BJP government was sworn in. Tomato was selling for Rs 24-28 per kg at India's commercial capital.The government on Tuesday imposed a minimum export price of US $300 per tonne on onion to curb its exports and help cool rising domestic prices. Onion prices have risen to about Rs 25-30 per kg in the national capital from Rs 15-20 per kg a fortnight ago.Given that the main Nashik-Lasalgaon mandi has enough onion stocks to last until the end of the year, traders say hoarding and profiteering is the only explanation for the spike in prices.Sanjay Pingle, one of the largest traders in the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Mumbai's Vashi locality, said, ""We have enough onion stocks to last another four or five months. Farmers are holding back produce marginally in the hope of making bigger profits if rates continue to rise. But we are not likely to see prices escalate to absurd lengths this year because PM Modi just announced that the government will crack down on hoarders.""In Kolkata, however, the prices of potatoes, most other vegetables, spices and pulses have only seen a marginal change in the last one month. Onions were the exception, with prices of the staple rising from Rs 22/23 per kg to Rs 28/30 per kg.The rise in veggie prices has been sharper in Chennai over the last two weeks although groceries have held steady, according to the city's wholesale dealers. Koyambedu Vegetable Market Association advisor V R Soundararajan said the onslaught of summer and low yield of crops were the main reasons for the rise. Wholesale grocery dealers denied that there was any kind of hoarding and said supplies were normal.In Kerala, experts said heavy summer showers and expectations of a weak monsoon were the reasons for fluctuating prices of vegetables. In Thiruvananthapuram, the price of drumsticks and beans were skyrocketing while those of tomatoes and carrots were tapering. This has been happening over the past three weeks. In Kochi, prices of almost all vegetables  onions, beans, carrots and cabbages  had gone up by Rs 2-4 over the past few weeks. Beans were up to Rs 80/kg, from Rs 68 a month ago. However, the price of potatoes and tomatoes had remained steady.Similarly, vegetable prices had gone up in Pune, where retailers were charging Rs 25-35 for a kg of onions as against Rs 20 a month ago. Potatoes were selling at Rs 30-35 per kg as against Rs 20-25 in the second week of May. In Jaipur, rising temperatures had reduced the shelf life of vegetables, leading to a price spurt. Onions had become dearer by Rs 10 in a week's time as the city faced shortages due to delay in supplies from Nasik. Potatoes saw a Rs 4-7 rise in the same period.In Gujarat, prices of onions and potatoes had increased by 15% in the last one week. Potato, which was Rs 14 per kg in the wholesale market on June 9, had jumped to Rs 16, with retailers selling the tuber for Rs 22. Deepak Patel, secretary of the APMC, Ahmedabad, said: ""Supply of vegetables has dropped drastically and this has led to a steep increase in prices. This trend is expected to continue for another one month, till the new crop arrives in the market."""
306,Govt boosts supplies to rein in inflation,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Govt-boosts-supplies-to-rein-in-inflation/articleshow/36733167.cms,2014-10-16,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday stepped up its efforts to tame rising food prices through a slew of measures meant to increase the supply of rice, potatoes, onions, fruits and vegetables in local markets and announced a crackdown on hoarders.""Additional quantities of rice will be released into the market. We will import pulses, if there is a shortage. Cereals and edible oil can be imported if states feel there is a shortage,"" finance minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after a meeting with his Cabinet colleagues.Though the government is monitoring the price movement of 22 commodities, a spurt has been noticed in four-five food products. The government's move to announce the steps is aimed at managing prices before they start spiraling and have political implications. The UPA government was often blamed for its slow response, propelling inflation into a key election issue. The Narendra Modi government's response has been quick and came a day after data showed that potato and other food prices had driven inflation past the 6% mark for the first time since December. It has repeatedly said it intends to focus on keeping inflation under control.Fears of a weak monsoon and its adverse impact on food production are driving up prices, especially of vegetables. In addition, the violence in Iraq has triggered fears of a spike in oil prices, which can push up inflation further.While the government imposed a minimum export price of $300 a tonne on onions to discourage shipments out of the country, a similar levy on potatoes will be initiated by the commerce department, Jaitley said.On June 11, TOI was the first to report that the government was going to impose a minimum export price to augment supplies in the domestic market even as it was tracking the prices of potatoes, non-basmati rice and skimmed milk powder.The finance minister said states have been asked to delist certain items, which are usually procured through Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees, so that they come into the open market. Delhi lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung has been asked to procure onions and potatoes from the open market and ensure abundant supplies through Mother Dairy retail outlets. He has also been asked to delist all food items in the capital, a move that will enable farmers to sell their produce directly to the market.Similarly, 50 lakh tonnes of rice will be released in the open market through state governments to cool prices.With regard to pulses and edible oil, states will be given a line of credit to directly import them to meet local demand, Jaitley said.""The meeting also reviewed the steady increase in retail price of milk and decided to consider withholding export incentives, currently in force,"" an official statement said."
307,Onion prices may hit Rs 100 per kg by October,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Onion-prices-may-hit-Rs-100-per-kg-by-October/articleshow/36806941.cms,2014-10-17,The Times Of India,"PUNE, KOLKATA: Onion prices are poised to jump to Rs 100 per kg by October while potato rates may fall briefly but rise again despite government measures to boost supply by restricting exports, as hailstorms and unseasonal rain in the past, along with the weak start of the monsoon season has created scarcity and strong inflationary pressures.Onions, currently retailing for Rs 20-30 per kg in different parts of the country, are particularly vulnerable despite the imposition of a minimum export price (MEP) and official estimates that 2013-14 output would rise 14% to 192 lakh tonnes. This is because the rabi crop in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh has been extensively damaged by adverse weather, traders say, although there is no firm estimate of the loss. Further, the price of seeds has jumped 400% compared to the previous year as there is a big scarcity in the market. This will reduce the area under cultivation, traders said.""The price can rise to Rs 100 per kg around October,"" said a leading industry official, who did not want to be quoted because of the political sensitivity of onion prices. Leading traders and an official of a government body agreed with the assessment.Like onions, adverse weather has also hit potato output, while the demand is high. Export of potatoes to countries such as Pakistan is driving up prices, but traders said restrictions on foreign shipments would not significantly change the fundamentals of the market. Prices may briefly fall by Rs 1-2 per kg from the current level of about Rs 20, traders said, but they will rise again due to short supply.In addition to disincentivising potato exports, the government on Wednesday took initial steps towards banning the trading of potato futures.It disallowed fresh positions in existing contracts through September, citing ""low volumes and deliveries"" on the futures market. Regulatory officials clarified that the step was not linked to food price inflation, though it comes at a time rising prices have created cause for concern.While monthly contracts up to September run concurrently on commodity bourse MCX, margins to trade on the long or buy side for the June contract have been raised to 25% from 5% earlier with effect from June 23, reducing the leverage a trader can take from 20 times earlier to 4 times in the current month.For the contracts from July through September, fresh trading positions will not be allowed with immediate effect.Rather, traders will only be able to square off existing contracts. For instance, a trader holding an outstanding buy position will be able to sell the same and exit the market. Those having a sell position will be only able to buy it back.Volumes of potato on MCX are very low indeed. For instance, potato volumes (Rs 34 crore) as a proportion of total volumes on MCX (19135 crore) were just.17% on Monday, market data on the bourse shows. On Tuesday, it was even lower at 0.1%.Market participants said the regulator could have taken the measure as a matter of abundant caution against the decade old futures market being blamed for stoking inflation. Years ago, the government banned rice, tur and urad futures though a committee chaired by Abhijit Sen could not find a conclusive link between high food price inflation and futures trading in certain commodities.""Though potato futures volumes are low, the government could have taken the step to discontinue fresh positions as a matter of abundant caution,"" said Suresh Nair, director, Admisi Commodities.In the case of onions, traders said prices could have been calmed with a good kharif crop that is planted in May and June, and harvested by October but the crop has been delayed by about 15 days and the outlook for the monsoon for the rest of the month is not bright. Historically, onion prices have always increased if the kharif crop is delayed or depleted.Traders and exporters said the MEP of $300/tonne, which is the current export price, would not have an impact on the market. ""MEP has proved to be of no use to curtail exports in the past. Despite MEP of $1,200/tonne, the exports continued last year,"" said Danish Shah, managing partner of Sanghar Exports and member of the National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF).Shah said that the government will have to plan to import onions right from now as the shipments take time to arrive.It will have to avoid the mistakes done by last government, which took the decision to allow imports so late that it proved futile. Also, the cargo was waiting for a month at the ports due to phytosanitary issues.""Currently, large quantities are shipped out on consignment basis. The government can also introduce letter of credit to allow genuine export to take place so that we do not lose our export market too,"" said Shah. Curtailing exports will also help to keep a higher proportion of good quality onion within the country, which will last longer.Importing the bulb at many ports and making a proper plan of its marketing will have to be on the agenda of the government to keep the prices up to Rs 50/kg.Currently, onion is available in many countries and the landed cost can be Rs 25/kg to Rs 30/kg. However, the trade insiders say that the government should not import too early also, which will result in fall in prices, making farmers suffer losses. ""The government will also have to be careful about the quantity of import to avoid international prices from appreciating,"" said an old time trader.In the case of potatoes, traders said export restrictions would encourage offloading of stocks but overseas sales is only one of the factors driving up its prices. ""Prices of potato is going up for three reasons. Firstly, there is a shortage of potato in the market. Secondly, the export markets in Pakistan and middle east are very strong and thirdly, the Karnataka crop which is currently being sown has been affected due to less rainfall,"" Rajesh Goel, general secretary, Federation of Cold Storage Association of India told ET. He said in Uttar Pradesh, the largest potato producer, storage of the tuber had fallen 12-14% due to rainfall in February.Potatoes are being sold for Rs 20-22 per kg in the state, and the prices may drop by Rs 1-2 per kg for some time if exports are curbed, he said. ""But that will be for a temporary period ... Since there is a shortage in the market, prices will not drop drastically due to government intervention,"" he said. Trade officials said potato sowing was down 40% in Karnataka as In Bengal, the second-largest producer of potato, prices are likely to rise from Rs 18 per kg to Rs 20-22 per kg as there is heavy demand from neighbouring states and even southern India as the output is falling, said Dilip Pratihar, advisor, West Bengal Potato Merchants Association."
308,"To tame inflation, govt needs to focus on 4 items, 8 states",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/To-tame-inflation-govt-needs-to-focus-on-4-items-8-states/articleshow/36791335.cms,2014-10-17,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: The key to the Modi government's bid to tame food prices could lie in focusing on four staples - wheat, rice, onions and potatoes - and eight states prone to high inflation as this can slash overall inflation by as much as 3.2%.A fall of 5% inflation in a basket of commodities accounting for 20.5% of an average household's expenses could be central to the new government's strategy, an official paper has suggested.Analyzing persistent high food inflation despite a decline in other categories, Ashish Kumar and Dilip Sinha of the ministry of statistics have noted that the four food items along with milk are critical focus areas.Taken together, they command a significant influence in the rate of inflation in food items that then impacts overall inflation.The paper also notes that eight states - UP, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Karnataka - account for a 64% share in India's total consumer expenditure.""A fall of 5% inflation, based on consumer price index of these states put together, may result in a decline of overall inflation by 3.2% in all India inflation,"" the paper said.A reading of inflation through 2012-2013 provides a fairly clear picture of why the Congress-led UPA paid a heavy political price for its inability to control food prices and overall inflation.In 2012, inflation rates for cereals and products, milk and milk products and vegetables were 7%, 12.5% and 14% and these rose to a staggering 15%, 8% and 26% in 2013.These three sub-groups kept inflation rate of food items at a high level leading to high overall inflation rate in both years in the run up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election.It is telling that annual inflation rates for 2012 and 2013 were 10% and 12% and price rise hit a peak of 14% in November, 2013, just ahead of four state elections that Congress lost comprehensively.Routs in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Chhattisgarh provided a big boost to Narendra Modi's campaign to pitch BJP as frontrunner and Congress as the laggard.By the same token, the paper indicates just what the NDA's task should be if it wants to avoid falling in the same trap as the Congress.UPA's failures show up in inflation graph, based on wholesale price index, in 2013 depicting a steep decline from February till May when it fell to 4.5% and then climbed to 7% by August - the level where it remained.The jump in WPI inflation from 5% to 6% in the post-poll months of 2014 are therefore a warning bell for the NDA as neglecting spikes in food prices may make them permanent.A reason for food prices remaining high during UPA years could be revisions in minimum support prices for wheat and rice, but the problem was aggravated by poor supply management. In the case of milk and eggs, demand was simply not correctly anticipated.The combined rural and urban CPI since November, 2013 has tapered somewhat, dropping from 14.8% to 9.95% in March, 2014, but the fall was not significant enough - and came too late - to help revive the UPA's fortunes."

Farmers will be at liberty to sell their produce directly to the end buyer. Doing away with the mandis will ensure a fall in prices and check hoarding.On Wednesday, lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung announced the government's decision to regulate the market under Section 3 of the Delhi Agriculture Produce Marketing (regulation) Act, 1998. The government has also written to the Centre, asking for fixing of stock limits.This move comes after finance minister Arun Jaitley addressed a high-level meeting of ministers and secretaries on Tuesday where he instructed states to delist fruits and vegetables from the agriculture produce marketing committees to control food inflation.In Delhi, 118 commodities are notified under the Delhi APM Act. Sources said that deregulation would help get rid of the middlemen because of whom prices of food items often rose by more than 100% from the time the produce left the field till it landed up in one's home.""If goods were priced Rs 5 lakh, the farmer was taking away only Rs 2-2.5 lakh. This is the extent of cost escalation. The move will see prices fall significantly in the capital. It will have to be worked out where the sellers and buyers will interact etc. However, the government will first have to ask the public for objections and suggestions before amending the Act,"" said sources.In a review on Wednesday, the LG also asked officials to ensure that Delhi did not witness any rise in prices of onions and potatoes. NAFED has been instructed to purchase onions on behalf of Delhi government. SAFAL outlets in Delhi have also been asked to double stocks. Delhi Agriculture Marketing Board will also set up 60 to 70 mobile vans across Delhi where it will sell onions and potatoes at government determined rates."
310,"Veggie prices soar, weather blamed",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Veggie-prices-soar-weather-blamed/articleshow/36858953.cms,2014-10-18,The Times Of India,"PUNE: Union finance minister Arun Jaitley may have announced de-listing of fruits and vegetables from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act to control prices, but vegetable rates in the city have soared by about 50% or more in the retail market and around 10% in the wholesale market in the last few days, making organic vegetables cheaper in some cases.Retailers and APMC officials blamed the fall in supply in the last few days due to hostile weather conditions -- increase in humidity level, lack of water this summer and scanty rainfall. They added that vegetable prices will continue to remain high during the next two months.An APMC official told TOI that the prices have shot up in the last 10 to 15 days due to poor supply. ""Supply has been affected due to lack of rainfall and paucity of water in wells. Vegetable wholesale and retail prices have risen, with onions, potatoes, okra and cauliflower leading in cost,"" he said.He however added that the rise in prices of most vegetables is nominal in the wholesale market and usually happens during this period. ""Vegetables were planted two to three months ago in summer, which often experiences water scarcity. Hence, the supply itself has fallen by about 10% during the last 10 to 15 days,"" he said.Another APMC official said that onion prices have especially gone up as there has been a shortfall in their supply. ""Untimely rains a few months ago affected onions and leafy vegetables. In May, the wholesale price of onions was around Rs 500 to Rs 1,400 per quintal, which escalated to Rs 900-2,100 per quintal on Thursday,"" the official added.Officials said that even prices of vegetables like okra and string beans have gone up in the wholesale market, which in turn has reflected in the retail market too. A quintal of Okra cost Rs 800-2,000 in May, while it went to Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,000 in June. Not only this, a quintal of string beans which cost Rs 700 to 2,500 in May, now costs Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,500 in the wholesale market.Officials feared that prices will remain high during July and August, and will normalize once there has been sufficient rain in the district.A retailer in Camp, Nilesh Saykar, said the rise in prices is a result of high humidity levels that reduced the supply considerably. Another retailer in Model Colony added that the daily supply has reduced by about 40% for his outlet too during the last few days. He is currently selling vegetables like cauliflower and gourd at Rs 80 per kg, okra and string beans at Rs 70 per kg and onions and potatoes at Rs 35 per kg.The rise in veggie prices has been far from marginal and in some cases costlier than organic vegetables. For instance, vegetables such as cauliflower, string beans, gourd, spinach, okra, among others are being sold over Rs 50 per kg in some areas, whereas an organic vegetable outlet is selling these at Rs 50 per kg. ""We have a fixed price all round the year, irrespective of what the retail market prices are. All vegetables are sold at a fixed price of Rs 50 per kg, except onions, tomatoes and potatoes, which are sold for Rs 30 per kg,"" said Jitendra Alase of O Fresh, a city-based organic vegetable store."

Sources said this will ensure enough availability of onion through government outlets, something that was done in October-November last year.Officials said the decision was taken on Friday at a meeting, which was attended by officials from the agriculture ministry, Nafed, Safal and other agencies. The decision gains importance considering the fact that Delhi may go to polls in October and amidst reports that onion prices could spike in the months ahead due to short supply.Government data show while the wholesale onion price in Nagpur was higher at Rs 11.7 per kg on Thursday in comparison to Delhi's Rs 11.6, the retail price in the national capital was higher at Rs 26 as compared to Nagpur's Rs 20.Market sources said the government decision, asking Nafed to procure huge quantity of onion for Delhi, would push wholesale prices in major mandis in Maharashtra. ""Ideally the government should ask Nafed to get enough onion for Delhi market and it should fix a price at which the onion should be lifted by the government agency. To address problem of a city, we should not create a bigger one for the rest of the country,"" said a market analyst.Meanwhile, potato prices have touched Rs 26 a kg in the national capital. Sources said Madhya Pradesh government has promised smooth supply, which would come as a big relief to the Centre and particularly to Delhiites."

He said it was wrong on part of the Indian government to start potato imports as actual consignments would take one month for delivery, and would coincide almost with the arrivals of fresh crop in the market.He pointed out that in any case, the new domestic crop would start arriving in January. He observed that the prices had by-and-large stabilized and there was no point to import potatoes.

With Deepavali fast approaching, its price stood at Rs. 9 on Saturday in both Uzhavar Sandhais in the district and also in the open market. The price of ladys finger has also come down from Rs. 30 to Rs. 16 a kg, snake gourd from Rs. 20 to Rs. 12; bitter gourd from Rs. 30 to Rs. 20, and beetroot from Rs. 30 to Rs. 20. The price of other vegetables such as brinjal (Rs. 30 per kg), potato (Rs. 40), Ooty carrot (Rs. 42), onion (Rs. 24), ginger (Rs. 45), chilly (Rs. 28) has remained stable in the Uzhavar Santhais for the past many days.However, the price of beans and avarai, due to poor arrival, has shot up to Rs. 46 and Rs. 30 per kg respectively.The moderate seasonal rainfall at present experienced by various parts of the district has proved good for the horticulture crops and the price is expected to remain stable till this month end, according to the farmers attached to the Hasthampatti Uzhavar Santhai in the city."

At later stage even the private big retail chain players would be called to attend such meeting so that some mechanism can be established in the next six moths to one year. The idea is to enlist the marketing network of these cooperatives and large retailers to remove supply side bottlenecks in reining-in prices.Government officials said that state cooperatives can be asked to set up temporary outlets for selling vegetables, rice, pulses, onions, potatoes and oils at affordable prices for which a proper institutional mechanism has to be in the place.Sources said that one round of such meeting was held at Krishi Bhawan where representatives from cooperatives were present. ""The focus is to ensure that there is enough supply of fresh produce in cities from regions where the production is abundant. One can easily find how there is huge difference in prices between one place to the other. That can be managed when we can get items in the market than just agricultural produce market committees (APMCs) having control,"" said one of the participants.The Narendra Modi committee report on checking food prices in 2011 had categorically recommended, In a few cases such as vegetable and fruits, efficiency of distribution channel can be increased by providing direct access of markets to the farmers. Farmers' market can be promoted for the direct marketing of products like perishables from farmers directly to the towns and semi urban areas.""Sources said though the plan of having alternate supply chain is critical and the need of the hours, many issues including financials have to be addressed quickly."

""Strict action will be taken against these people,"" said a source.Pre-empting such a move, lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung had on Wednesday directed officials to act against those found hoarding essential goods. A drive was carried out by the department of food and civil supplies on Thursday to check hoarding of essential commodities, especially onions and potatoes. More are being organized in the coming week.SS Yadav, commissioner, department of food and civil supplies, said supply was much more than current requirement. ""We have been checking prices from 329 retail outlets.

317,Doctor says no overtime; pregnant worker's boss says no job,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/Doctor-says-no-overtime-pregnant-workers-boss-says-no-job/articleshow/44885056.cms,2014-10-20,The Times Of India,"Angelica Valencia put the doctor's note in her pocketbook and stepped out of her apartment in the early morning darkness. Then she started praying.She prayed on the crowded buses and on the subway train that carried her from Queens into the Bronx to the potato-packing plant where she worked. ""Please let me keep my job,"" she repeated during her two-hour commute. ""Please let everything work out.""She punched in at 7:30 a.m. and handed her manager the note. Then Valencia, who was 39 and three months pregnant, went straight to work. Last year, she had a miscarriage. This time, her doctor said, she was once again high risk. No overtime, he ordered, just eight hours a day.But it was the busy season at the Fierman Produce Exchange, and her bosses had already told her she had to work overtime. So as Valencia sorted potatoes on that Aug. 8 morning, she worried: How would her supervisors respond to the doctor's note? At the end of her shift, would she still have a job?This month is the first anniversary of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which was signed into law by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Oct. 2, 2013. The law, which went into effect in January, represents a big step forward for working women.It requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers  such as providing rest and water breaks, modified schedules and light duty  so long as the accommodations don't cause undue hardship for the employer. Makes sense, right? It's actually critical, particularly for low-income women who sometimes get pushed out of their jobs  and into poverty  when they become pregnant.So this year, officials from the city's Commission on Human Rights, which enforces the law, and advocates for women have been talking to business groups, doctors, nurses, union representatives and others to ensure that women know their rights and employers know their obligations under the statute.But Valencia said her company never informed her of her rights, even though that is required. She had no idea that the law existed.What Valencia did know was that she could not afford to lose her job. She had worked at Fierman Produce for three years. She earned $8.70 an hour, a salary that she and her husband, a driver for a private bus company, counted on to pay bills and cover expenses on their studio apartment in Corona, Queens.With a baby on the way, that paycheck was even more precious.""Now more than ever, I need to work,"" she said.But when Valencia told her supervisors in July that she had a high-risk pregnancy, they told her she could work only without restrictions, she said. After taking time off to try to negotiate an accommodation with the company, she returned when her co-workers volunteered to handle the heavy machinery and lifting.In August, she said, her supervisors insisted that she work overtime. Valencia felt so ill after two lengthy shifts that she went to the hospital and then to her doctor, who gave her the letter that she handed to her boss.The response from the company came at about 9:30 a.m., when she was handed a letter written by Bob Ferla, the operations manager.""Unfortunately, we as a company are not able to allow you to continue work,"" wrote Ferla, who warned that her high-risk pregnancy could put her ""at risk"" in a work environment that was fast-paced, was very physical and involved machinery.""Please understand we need a 'full-duty release' from the doctor,"" he added, if she wanted to continue to work.Valencia said she begged her managers to excuse her from overtime as her doctor had recommended. She pointed out that the company's busy season typically ended in September, and that overtime was rarely needed during the rest of the year.But her managers insisted that she could not work without a full-duty medical clearance. So Valencia turned in her company identification and wept as she started the long commute home.We know that the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act can make a difference. Talk to Sonica Smith, a pregnant sales associate at Zara, a clothing store, who recently negotiated regular breaks to rest and go to the bathroom. Talk to Floralba Fernandez Espinal, who was reinstated after being forced out of her job at a thrift shop.Both women were represented by Dina Bakst, the co-president of A Better Balance, the legal advocacy group that now represents Valencia, who hopes to recoup the wages she lost.Reached by phone on Friday, Ferla declined to comment, saying the matter had been referred to the company's legal counsel.So, for the moment, there is no happy ending to this column. And I can't help wondering how many other pregnant women are still being pushed out of jobs they desperately need.But in Queens, Valencia is hopeful. She just found out that she'll be having a baby girl. And she knows now that the law is on her side."

A special high-level teams led by sub divisional magistrates (SDM) would also conduct checks at the markets randomly. If anyone found guilty of hoarding vegetables, the person would be punished strictly, even imprisoned.UT administration officials on Saturday held a meeting with traders and directed them not to practice hoarding and asked them to give details of the sale of vegetables and prices to the market committee on a daily basis at their office in Sector 26.""The prices of onion and potatoes are under control. But due to the strike in Nasik and the damage of crop in Madhya Pradesh, we are taking precautionary measures. Reports have emerged that in a coming few days, onion will start coming from Karnataka and Nasik. Traders, however, have been told not to indulge in any type of hoarding,"" said Vivek Partap Singh, municipal commissioner, who is also holding the charge of UT deputy commissioner.""We called the meeting of the traders of Sector 26 on Saturday and told them to provide their daily record of sale to the market committee officials,"" Singh added.Sources said the market committee has already started keeping an eye on the entry and exit points of Sector 26 grain market to check the illegal transportation of vegetables.

320,Hong Kong and its shared spaces,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/at-one-remove/hong-kong-and-its-shared-spaces/,2014-10-20,The Times Of India,"People keep their shoes and umbrella outside the apartment in the hallway in Hong Kong. Same goes for laundry. Certain housing committees forbid the use of drying racks that extended out of the window, especially if the said window happens to be facing a road as this spoils the look of the buildings facade. Shirts and trousers are hung from clotheslines put up overhead in hallways and landings  a slew of near-human interceptors whose cold, limp digits must touch one in the head and shoulders on the way to the door. Sometimes gods in their modest red and gold shrines are made to wait outside the door as well, the moisture hanging in the air made heavier still with the smell rising from the incense sticks.The paucity of space in this city has led architects to collapse living spaces into shockingly-minuscule units. Its possible to use the wash basin while still sitting on the toilet seat, just as it is impossible to get the chopping and dicing done without getting ones elbow in the kitchen door, hence the urge to claim a chunk of shared space and make it ones own. But its different from the way they would do it in my hometown in Calcutta where the hijacking might start most innocuously  by installing a deity painted on a white ceramic square, propped up against three bricks on the pavement. In a weeks time this somewhat pitiful image of divinity could well have morphed into a temple  once again plastered with the vitrified tiles used on bathroom walls  with an idol and a donation box and a weekly ritual worship performed under a marquee with a few hundred devotees attending. Similarly, a four-storey club house might come up on someones lawn if people start meeting there to exchange neighbourhood gossip. A water body thats home to a range of flora and fauna might get turned into a landfill overnight.The process of claiming other peoples spaces is a lot less furtive and less aesthetically-jarring in Hong Kong. Its also a lot more transient  something like a change of the seasons, each adding its own colour and effervescence to the existing scene. Garlands of orange peels sunning on packing crates in front of the neighbourhood grocery shops are a seasonal phenomenon. As indeed are the rows of quilts with Hello Kitty and Cheese stock toon figures put out on the railing along the pavement in this season of the maturing sun. The man roasting chestnuts and sweet potatoes in a giant wok on a portable charcoal oven next to the pedestrian walkway will pack up and leave about the time people start collecting in little huddles at the roadside eateries for supper. By 10 pm the place where they sat will be reclaimed by pedestrians, the collapsible tables and moulded plastic chairs having vanished behind the rolling shutters of the diner. Even those people who have made the protest sites at Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok their home for the last three weeks would not be there forever.While on the subject of laying a claim on public spaces, the Occupy movement now on in Hong Kong has, by default, opened up newer routes, terrains, and a whole new way of looking at them. Often its faster to walk than depend on public transport, as sections of the citys main thoroughfares are cordoned off to vehicular traffic. If the Escalator (ostensibly, the worlds longest) taking execs from the central business district to their over-priced apartments in Mid-levels is too over-crowded, trotting up the hill should be far more relaxing and at any rate a more economic option than running the treadmill in air-conditioned glass cases after a long day at work.Its possible that the bus youve been queuing up for since the last one and half hours may not come and if it did it may not have the space to take you on board. In the bargain the re-routing and abrupt suspension of bus services could, potentially, lead to the discovery of spaces and perspectives that one may not have experienced before. This, in fact, is your chance to land up where you least expected to be, and claim a share of strange, unfamiliar spaces that you never knew existed. Like the other day when the bus I was on skipped two stops in between and went up a flyover to avoid the protest zone at Admiralty, circling it from above, the sight of miles and miles of people stretched out on the roads punctuated by blue and white tents against the backdrop of some of Hong Kongs most iconic towers  symbols of its financial might  was quite incredible. It felt like having a dress circle ticket to a limited edition show that may not last beyond the opening season."

""The production of potato and onions has been more than that in last year. Therefore, there is no scarcity of the two items in the country. The only thing required is stern action against hoarders who have been causing artificial scarcity, leading to increase in their prices,"" he added. The minister was in the state in connection with a meeting.He said price rise was part and parcel of any ""system (read economy)""  be it the planned (or regulated) and open or market economy. ""Isn't it true that price rise has always been around in any system?"" he asked and added, ""The Centre would, in no situation, allow it (inflation) to cross the Lakshman Rekha."" Decoding the term, Singh set the bar for it at 25%.With regard to the steep hike in railways passenger fare and freight announced on Friday, Singh said, ""Railway majboot ho ye kaam karenge, railway barbaad ho yeh nahin karenge (We will do everything that makes the railways strong, and nothing that will destroy it).""Asked about the cascading effect that the hike would have on prices of all commodities, Singh referred to the Lakshman Rekha metaphor, and added, ""The results of the steps we are taking will be visible two to three years later. At present, we are engaged in strengthening the economy, and come back to politics in the fifth year.""Singh said talks were being held with the railways to transport milk containers in a bid to bring down its prices. The policy, rules and regulations in this regard would be ready in three months, he said. According to him, prices of food and other items would be brought down by increased production of foodgrain.Referring to the coming of 'achche din (good days)', Singh said, ""This situation will come about if the states utilize the money allotted to them by the Centre. The thrust is on augmenting production."""

Similarly, the wholesale price of potato is Rs 15 and is being sold at Rs 18 per kilo in retail market. However, the prices of potato and tomato were Rs 14 and Rs 16 per kg last week respectively.""All market intelligence officers in districts have been asked to keep a watch on prices of potato and tomato in retail market and also on hoarding. Supply to the state is normal but since the price in source points have gone up, the price has increased a bit,"" said a senior officer in the Food Supply and Consumer Welfare department.Apart from potato and tomato soaring prices of vegetables including has put extra burden on consumers. The vegetable bill of people of Bhubaneswar has been rising for the last few days with a rise ranging from at least Rs 20 to Rs 30 on every kilo.The continuing dry spell and drop in supply from neighbouring states are the main reasons for the soaring price of vegetables, vendors said. There has been a huge gap between demand and supply.""Vegetable supply from the local market has also dropped. We are being forced to sell vegetables at a higher rate to increase our profit margin, as we are paying more to buy them. Compared to nearly 80-100 trucks of vegetables coming to the city daily, only 50-60 trucks have been arriving, but the demand remains the same. The price is bound to go up,"" said secretary of Rajdhani Haat Byabasayee Sangha, Gayadhar Swain.Brinjal was selling at Rs 40 a kilo in different city markets compared to Rs 15-20 last week.

324,"Gas price to go up, though less than UPA plan",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Gas-price-to-go-up-though-less-than-UPA-plan/articleshow/37108315.cms,2014-10-22,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: CNG and piped natural gas prices are set to go up shortly, though not as much as feared. Indications emerging from hectic discussions between the oil ministry and Prime Minister's Office over the weekend suggest that gas price may be jacked up from $4.2 a unit to $5.5-6.8 per unit.This increase will be almost $2 less than the $8.4 per unit price that was expected on the basis of formula adopted by the UPA government. But still, the hike will impact daily cost of living, particularly in a city such Delhi where CNG is used for public transport and PNG is increasingly becoming the choice for cooking.Higher gas price will also have marginal impact on overall cost of power by pushing up electricity tariff for gas-fired plants, which account for roughly 8% of the installed capacity in the country.Assuming the government finally settles for a price of $6.8, CNG price in Delhi would go up by approximately Rs 7.50 per kg. Hypothetically even after a new gas price is announced, CNG would still be cheaper than what it cost in February. CNG price was reduced by Rs 14.90 per kg and PNG by Rs 5 per unit in February after the Centre said the entire gas demand would be met with cheaper domestic gas.Subsequently, CNG price in Delhi was raised by Rs 2.95 per kg in May due to falling rupee and rise in operational costs. So, even after this hike, the current price is Rs 11.95 cheaper than February level. Thus the fuel would be still cost Rs 4.45 less than in February.The discussions within the government are focused on simplifying the pricing formula to avoid doubling of present gas price. In all likelihood, the new formula would have among the benchmarks, markets with friendlier gas price. Thus Russia is expected to replace Japan, a country that imports gas in ships at very high prices.The new formula is also expected to specify pricing method based on net calorific value (NCV), which works out 10% cheaper than gross calorific value (GCV). NCV is calculated on reduced volumes upon deducting impurities such as water or other gaseous content present in natural gas.There is also a possibility that the government could opt for a differential pricing by applying the latest pricing only to fields that are currently in production. Others that come on stream in near future, such as state-run ONGC's marginal fields, would be allowed to sell at market price through tender system.Such a move is seen serving two purposes: One, it will mark a gradual shift towards market-determined pricing shift-- the original aim of oil sector reforms. Two, in a single stroke it would brighten investment climate by removing clouds over viability of new discoveries - mostly in deep and frontier waters.Another option on the table also envisages asking ONGC, the biggest beneficiary of any price revision, to part some of the money to share increased fuel subsidy. Taking off on this, there are also suggestions that the government could deregulate diesel price while simultaneously reducing Central levy on the fuel in the Budget to soften the blow on consumers. ONGC then can be asked to share the increased burden on fertilisers.Prime minister Narendra Modi has held two rounds of brainstorming sessions, mainly focused on the issue, with oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and petroleum secretary Saurabh Chandra. After a five-hour session on Friday evening, the PM held another round of discussion on Sunday that was also attended by finance minister Arun Jaitley.The framing of policy on gas pricing became a hot potato after a political storm arose during elections over allegations of crony-capitalism, public interest litigation in the Supreme Court as well as arbitration notices served against the government by Reliance Industries Ltd and BP Plc.But subsequent question whether Reliance Industries Ltd should be allowed higher gas price due to drop in output from its KG-D6 field delayed notification. Later, the Election Commission stepped in after a letter from AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, sending the entire issue into a tailspin."

The seeds will be sold during 2015-16 financial year. ""It will be increased to 1.5 lakh quintal of potato seeds and 2,500 quintal of onion seeds by 2016-17,"" said agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy.Against the annual requirement of 10.5 lakh MT of potato, the state produces 2.5 lakh MT. Hence, it depends on neighbouring West Bengal to meet around 80% potato requirement.The area under potato cultivation has come down to 14,000 hectare from 25,000 to 30,000 hectare during 1960s, the minister said.Since potato is a highly perishable commodity, farmers are reluctant to go for large- scale production in the absence of adequate storage facilities, lack of institutional support for marketing and assurance of a minimum support price from the government, sources said.To increase potato cultivation, the government is also planning to distribute 1350 metric tonne (MT) seeds among farmers this rabi season. The potato seeds will be procured from Chandigarh, Ahmedabad and Jalandhar, official sources said.""The government is taking steps to attain self-sufficiency in three years. We hope to cultivate 3.5 lakh MT potatoes from 15,000 to 20,000 hectare this year,"" said horticulture director Sanjib Chadha.""We need to procure the seeds by October to allow farmers to sow them by November and harvest the crop between February and March, he added.The state has requested International Potato Centre to provide short-duration varieties of potato seeds. Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla, has already provided 200 quintal of breeder seeds, official sources said, adding, the government is also mulling over signing an MoU with National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation for production of potato and onion seeds in the state."

Recent data had shown a spike in inflation but the government has moved in swiftly to ensure it is contained.Officials from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) apprised the PM of the monsoon situation. ""They said though the monsoon has been delayed, rainfall is likely to improve substantially in the months of July and August,"" said a statement from the prime minister's office.The ministry of Agriculture has prepared a contingency plan for more than 500 districts to deal with patchy rains. ""Modi stressed on the need for both Centre and States to proactively mount a coordinated effort in implementing the advance action plan for the monsoon, with districts, rather than states, being the unit of planning,"" the statement said.The PM emphasized on ensuring adequate power and seed availability for the agricultural sector, and directed that NREGA be used to generate rural employment, if necessary.The Modi administration has called for strict action against hoarders and black marketers. Hoarding has been identified as key factor for the sharp uptick in prices. States have a tardy record of arresting and prosecuting hoarders and the conviction rate is dismal. Government data showed that while 5,132 people were arrested for such acts in 2013 up to October, only 2,468 were prosecuted and the number of convicted was 966.Besides sending a strong message to hoarders, the government has also taken a raft of measures to ensure availability of food items across the country. The Modi government imposed a minimum export price (MEP) of Rs 2,7000 ($ 450) per tonne for potato on Thursday to keep a check on exports. Annually, around 1-2 lakh tonnes of potatoes are exported from the country.Food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan reiterated the government's resolve to fight against hoarders. ""It's only because of speculation prices are rising despite we have huge food stock, potato and onion,"" he added.Official said the government will ensure stable supplies of onions and potatoes in the market.""This will ensure that there is enough availability of the two main kitchen items in the domestic market. As such Delhi has been flooded with onion and prices have stabilized. We have to keep a close watch on onions in July when the supply at mandis reduces significantly,"" consumer affairs secretary Keshav Desiraju said.Within hours after Modi held a detailed review of the monsoon and food inflation progress, the Cabinet secretary Ajit Seth decided to hold a review meeting of Committee of Secretaries on Friday on the government's preparedness in case of a deficient monsoon.The government is also stepping up its vigil with the Cabinet secretary reviewing the price and monsoon situation every fortnight against the earlier practice of a monthly meeting. While Central Water Commission has asked states to prepare their crop plan keeping in mind the water stored, the drinking water and sanitation ministry has asked states to submit detailed contingency plans including identifying new bore wells and open wells, high yielding agricultural bore wells for hiring and possibility of transporting water through special trains to areas which may be affected due to scanty rains.States have also been asked to prepare adequate plans with route maps to supply safe drinking water through tankers for vulnerable villages. The PM also reviewed the position of water reservoirs and fodder stock. He urged that maximum possible use be made of the existing water resources, and best practices in rainwater harvesting."
329,No Rationale Behind Allowing Potato Import,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-rationale-behind-allowing-potato-import/story-khNIH65jKrgPNlpdvr7zfI.html,2014-10-26,Hindustan Times,"There has hardly been a year in memory when farmers have not thrown potato on the streets to protest against low prices. For decades now, I have watched a cycle of glut and low prices. And yet, the government has allowed import of potato for the first time ever. While the official explanation is that the imports are to augment domestic supplies and curb inflation, the fact remains that the production of potato has been almost normal this year with an insignificant shortfall of a mere 2.3%.At present, potato prices are ruling between Rs 30 and Rs 35 a kg.While the agriculture ministry has directed Nafed to float tenders to ensure shipments reach by the end of November, potato crop from Punjab is expected to hit the market by mid-November. The domestic market would be flooded by the time the imports come in and I wouldnt be surprised if farmers are once again forced to dump cartloads of potatoes on the highways. I, therefore, dont understand the economic rationale of allowing the import of potato when there is hardly any drop in production.Expert viewExperts say the kharif crop has been good, and the winter crop that is expected mid-November onwards is also likely to be normal. India is the third biggest producer of potato after China and Russia.But then, under pressure from a strong lobby of economists, food inflation is coming in as a handy excuse to open up the Indian market for import of fruits, vegetables and milk products. Some economists have called for lowering import tariffs on fruits and vegetables by 50% to allow imports. Besides fruits and vegetables, they are demanding India to open up for chicken legs (which is a waste in America) and skimmed milk powder.This is exactly what the European Union is demanding under ongoing negotiations of the bilateral Indo-European Union Free Trade Agreement.The domestic potato chip, fries and flake industry is now pressing for the removal of the 30% import duty on potato to make the imports cheaper. Potato imports into India are expected mainly from Europe and Australia.Interestingly, the decision to import potato comes at a time when India has been merrily exporting potato to Pakistan all through the year. Pakistan had resorted to duty-free potato imports from India continuously from March onwards. An average of 3,000 to 4,000 trucks had been crossing over daily from the Wagah border. Since the production is low in Pakistan this year, the economic coordination committee of the Pakistan cabinet has reportedly approved the duty-free import of potato from India till November 15. Interesting, isnt it? A month earlier, India was exporting potatoes, and will now resort to imports.Tomato alsoPotato is not the only victim of an ad hoc import-export policy. On a visit to a food processing unit in Sonepat district in Haryana, I was shocked when I was told that tomato paste is being imported in large quantities from China at a time when farmers were forced to throw tomato onto the streets for want of buyers. When food inflation was at its peak, reports of dumping of tomato by farmers had poured in from several parts of the country, including Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.With tomato prices crashing to Rs 2 (and at several places to Rs 1 per kg), farmers had no choice but to feed it to cattle or to throw it away. Just in one month, between August 28, 2014, and September 28, 2014, India imported $376,009 worth of dried tomato and tomato products (such as paste, pulp and juice concentrate) from China, followed by $94,057 worth of imports from Nepal, and $44,160 from the Netherlands.Not many know that the popular brands of tomato ketchup, puree and even juices that we consume at home are made from tomato imported from China, Nepal, Italy, the US and the Netherlands! In other words, we are inadvertently helping tomato farmers of the countries from where we import while our own farmers are left to die.The food-processing industry obviously justifies the imports, but what remains unexplained is if the objective of the industry is to source cheaper products from abroad, then why does the ministry of food processing claim that agro-processing is a boon for Indian farmers?Pasta importsTake the case of pasta. While huge quantities of wheat rots in godowns, Indian import of pasta from Italy has been growing at a phenomenal rate of 39% per year. Since pasta is made from wheat, why shouldnt efforts be made to produce it within the country? Indias import market for pasta has grown in 10 years from Rs 3.39 billion in 2003-04 to Rs 17.22 billion in 2013-14. And again, pasta attracts an import duty of 40%, and it is expected the import tariff would be reduced to 20% after the Indo-EU FTA comes into effect.(The writer is a food policy analyst.

(Express photo by Oinam Anand)Trilokpuri kept a tense peace on Sunday with the riot-control police and rapid action force patrolling its brick-strewn streets and no people in sight. The scene of day-long violence on Saturday wore a desolate look amid prohibitory orders that were in force to prevent any recurrence of rioting.But the calm came at a price. Hassled residents across blocks complained of lack of access to essential commodities such as milk. One complained that his children were deprived of milk and food as they are not allowed to step out and buy groceries from markets in adjoining areas. Shamim Ahmed, a shopkeeper in the area, said, We know Section 144 prohibits assembly of people, but they can at least allow one person from each house to go and fetch the groceries.He said children are crying for milk and they have been surviving only on water and biscuits.There is cash crunch as well. One person went out this morning to fetch some cash from an ATM in Mayur Vihar but he was beaten with lathis by the police and sent back home, Shamim said.Some of the markets in block number 22, 23 and 27 opened later in the day, but shopkeepers sold groceries at four times their actual retail price. Potato was being sold for Rs 80 per kg, onions for Rs 120 and a small packet of Kurkure snack that costs Rs 5 for Rs 15. A packet of milk that costs Rs 38 was going for Rs 70 and a litre of packaged drinking water for Rs 60.We have no option but to buy as we are not allowed to go outside. We have no money at home as the ATM in the area has also been damaged, Parveen, a housewife, complained.While others profiteer, 50-year-old Shameema Begum, the owner of a grocery shop in Sanjay Camp jhuggi where 500 Muslim families live, is the Good Samaritan. People were seen secretly taking turns to go inside the narrow lane where her shop is, emerging with packets concealed under their clothes  essentials, of course.Late Saturday evening, she had to shut down the shop after prohibitory orders were imposed. When the police imposed prohibitory orders, we had to make arrangements for essential commodities, Shameema said.Her husband secretly got milk and other essentials from Trilokpuris block no. 8, a Hindu area. We carried rice sacks and took as many milk packets as possible. We are thankful to our Hindu brothers and sisters who helped us in tough times, Shameema said.Apart from 32 detentions, 12 people were specifically detained on charges of raising false alarm and making bogus calls to police control room on Saturday, police said. An FIR for rioting has been registered and a total of 44 people have been detained. The investigation in the matter is on, said Deepak Mishra, special commissioner of police for law and order.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

But the retail price was Rs 24, nearly twice the level. ""It is quite surprising that the price doubles from the time it leaves Azadpur mandi. Middlemen seem to be charging a huge premium,"" said an official.In fact, official data showed that Delhi is seeing unusually price behaviour, although there is pressure in other markets such as Mumbai too, where the difference is a little under Rs 10 a kg. But in Kolkata, the difference between the wholesale and retail price is Rs 5 with households getting onions for Rs 24 a kg, the same as Delhi. Similarly, in Agra the difference is Rs 3 a kg, while in Hyderabad and Bangalore the gap is just Rs 2 a kg.A labourer weighs a sack of onions in a wholesale market in Hyderabad. (AFP photo)""There is an element of speculation and expectation that there will be a further spurt due to shortages. This needs to be handled,"" added an official, pointing to the spurt in retail prices in cities such as Bangalore, Vishakapatnam, Chennai, Indore and Bhubaneswar, where prices rose by up to Rs 12 a kg between May 27 and June 27.In Delhi, there was a moderation of Re 1 a kg in retail prices due to higher supplies by Nafed, but the wide gap in retail and wholesale rates is expected to be the subject of inter-ministerial discussions to crack down on the possibility of artificial jacking up of prices.A vendor selling onions and other vegetables in a makeshift retail shop in Kolkata. (TOI file photo)With monsoon rains expected to be lower than normal levels, the government is monitoring the prices of 22 essential commodities with onions, potatoes, milk, pulses and non-basmati rice coming under special focus. In Delhi, the Centre had ordered a special drive to ensure that there was adequate supply of onions and potatoes at reasonable rates.Finance minister Arun Jaitley is scheduled to meet state food and consumer affairs ministers this week, where the issue of rise in food prices will be discussed.While retail prices are holding up, officials said that there is a possibility of an increase in July when supplies from Rajasthan and Nashik slow down. Sources said that Delhi government has asked Nafed to supply onions and potatoes to meet possible shortages."
332,Magic potion to  heal burns,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/Magic-potion-to-heal-burns/articleshow/37505319.cms,2014-10-28,The Times Of India,"BHOPAL: Very few places in the country can boast of traditional healing medicines for burns like in Bhopal. While doctors offer little to burn patients even with depth of their knowledge, it is these traditional healers armed with herbs who have turned out to be best healers. Two such healers are serving people in Bhopal for decades, now.Agarwal Puri Bhandar, one of the oldest eat outs in Bhopal, known for its sumptuous puris, potato curry and pumpkin raita is also a place frequented by burn victims and their kin for the healing paste. The magic paste is provided free of cost to anyone asking for it. So much so, that in case of a burn ask any local and he would immediately direct you to Agarwal Puri Bhandar instead of a doctor.Three generations of Agarwal family have been serving burn victims. Shyam Babu, who started the eatery in Chowk area, was a philanthropist. His benevolence, finds a mention in Dominique Lapiere's book on gas tragedy 'Five Past Midnight In Bhopal'. ""My father fed a ravaged Bhopal for free after gas tragedy struck,"" says Sanjay, who was very young at the time and learning the tricks of the trade from his father.""He once burnt himself while frying puris and a ved rishi told him to make this paste and apply on his wounds. The result was remarkable and we have been helping burn victims since then,"" reveals Sanjay.So popular is the paste among residents that even doctors vouch for its effectiveness. ""I can't prescribe it for my patients, but I advise them to use it as a fast healer,"" says a paediatrician based in MP Nagar. Six-year-old daughter of Pramila S poured hot tea on herself and this paste came to her quick rescue. ""The paste cooled her wounds on the chest and also prevented itching,"" she says.Agarwals refuse to share the secret of this magic potion. ""We were sworn to secrecy. Thousands of people have benefitted from it,"" states Om. After Sanjay and Om, the two brothers in charge of restaurant, their children are going to carry the legacy forward.39-year-old Akshay Saksena is a godly figure for his patients. An IT professional, Akshay learnt the skill of taking care of burn victims with his potion of sesame oil from his father Prakash Saksena. His father got to know about it while serving as a PWD engineer in Ambikapur in Chhattisgarh. ""My sister, three-year-old then, had accidentally poured hot milk on herself and was badly burnt,"" narrates Akshay. ""Chhattisgarh was predominantly forest in 1970s and a family friend told my dad about sesame oil which mixed with portions of specific tree barks and other plants, has a miraculous effect on burns. My father tried it and it worked wonders.""""Under oath to not misuse the remedy ever, he started helping burn victims,"" adds Akshay. ""My father would keep three rooms in the house aside for burn patients and applied this oil on their wounds day in and day out. My mom and dad have dealt with cases with about 70% burns. Later he moved to Bilaspur, Korba and Pandra continuing his profession as well as passion to help the needy,"" says Akshay.Akshay now makes this magic potion at home and rushes on emergency calls from people who know about his healing touch. ""I visit my patients on a daily basis, dress their wounds and check their progress. Allopathic medicines can be consumed for pain relief but they hardly heal burns. Burns reduce a person's immunity and allopathy helps keep that intact to reduce infection. This oil cures external burns and cools them. It should be applied continuously as it ensures there are no scars either,"" says a confident Akshay."
333,Vegetable prices pinch pocket,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Vegetable-prices-pinch-pocket/articleshow/37558823.cms,2014-10-29,The Times Of India,"BHUBANESWAR: Prices of green vegetables have gone through the roof because of short supply from neighbouring states. Scanty rainfall in the state has accentuated fears of further rise in vegetable prices, including those of potato and onion.In the last few weeks, the wholesale price of all vegetables in the local market has doubled while the retail price is even more, vendors said. ""Eating healthy is getting costlier by the day. It is difficult to meet the nutritional needs of my children with the rising prices. None of the vegetables are within the reach of the common man,"" said Sagarika Mohapatra, a housewife.To check soaring prices of onion and potato, the state government has decided that the difference between the wholesale and retail prices will not exceed Rs 3.50 a kg for onion and Rs 2.50 for potato. Action will be taken against vendors for selling onion and potato at higher prices, official sources said.""Those who are in business must not try to make profit by selling essential items like onion and potato at a higher price,"" said secretary, food supplies and consumer welfare department, Madhusudan Padhy, adding the department will advertise the wholesale prices for the knowledge of consumers.On Monday, the wholesale price of potato was Rs 14 a kg while in retail market it was available for Rs 22 to Rs 25 a kg. Similarly, the wholesale price of onion was Rs 24 a kg but in retail market its price varied between Rs 28 and 30.""Potato stock is sufficient and supply is also regular in the state. Prices of onion increased due to fall in production at the source ,"" Padhy added.Similarly, prices of brinjals and lady's finger have gone up to Rs 40 and Rs 60 a kg against Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kg, around a week ago. Cabbage is priced at Rs 30 a kg against Rs 10 to 12 a kg earlier. Green chillies are selling at Rs 100-120 a kg depending on variety, against Rs 30 to Rs 40 a kg sometime back. Tomato is currently priced at Rs 24 a kg against Rs 16 to 18 earlier.""During the rainy season, vegetable prices usually go up. Supply from neighbouring states has reduced drastically while the supply from local markets has already stopped due to no rain this year,"" said Karunakar Sahu, a wholesale vegetable merchant at Unit-I market, here."
334,"Rein in onion retailers, states told",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Rein-in-onion-retailers-states-told/articleshow/37550730.cms,2014-10-29,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: The consumers affairs department on Monday shot off letters to state governments, asking them to focus on retailers who may be pocketing enormous gains by stocking up onions and creating an artificial scarcity.The letter was sent within hours of TOI report highlighting the huge gap between the wholesale and retail price of onions in markets such as Delhi, Mumbai, Indore and Chandigarh.Sources said consumer affairs secretary Keshav Desiraju has pointed out that there is little reason for a sharp difference in prices given the abundant stock of onions at the moment. ""We have asked states to act against such practice. Some states, including Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Delhi, have taken certain measures which will cool down retail prices,"" he told TOI, when contacted.The secretary also said the three states have sought the department's permission to impose a stock control limits on onion traders. ""We are considering this issue. An order will be issued soon. But the states can take such steps and we can give the concurrence later,"" Desiraju said.The steps come even as the Modi government is moving swiftly to contain possible price pressures and act against hoarding and black marketing. Sources said after government's clarion call against hoarders, the consumer affairs secretary had written to states.Officials said the roadmap to check artificial food inflation and particularly seasonal vegetables would be taken up at the state food and consumer affairs ministers meet later this week.They added that both immediate and medium and long term steps would be discussed. The long-term plan includes improving the supply chain while the short-term plan includes delisting certain food items including onion and potato from the ambit of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC).Consumer affairs ministry on Monday tweeted that a committee of secretaries will discuss the issue of price rise on July 2."
335,Veggie prices rise on â€˜rainfallâ€™,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Veggie-prices-rise-on-rainfall/articleshow/44964949.cms,2014-10-29,The Times Of India,"PANAJI: Kotmir (coriander) may no longer garnish your favourite savoury dish for a while, given that its price has jumped to 40 a bunch from 20 of a week ago.Citing the unexpected heavy showers in Goa, vegetable vendors have hiked prices of all vegetables by 10-15 a kilo. So, just like the aromatic herb, cluster beans and French beans have also doubled to 120 a kilo, while an average-sized ash gourd is a whopping 200 from 80 of a week ago.A casual stroll through the Panaji market shows that even staples like tomatoes, potatoes and onions have not been spared. A kilo of potatoes is 40 a kilo from last week's 30, tomatoes are 20 a kilo from 17, and onions are 30 a kilo from 25. A bunch of fenugreek (methi) is 10 from 6.The increase has forced the common man to either reduce quantities being bought or avoid some vegetables altogether. ""Beetroot hasn't been sold since morning,"" moaned vendor Mohammad Zafar at the Panaji market.The only price that has dropped is that of lime. While 50 got you three limes last week, it fetched 6-7 limes on Tuesday. ""Limes are in bulk in the market this week hence the rates are cheaper, 15 limes for 100,"" pitched vendor Ali Husain. Rates at the government-controlled horticulture kiosks have also risen, but the prices are comparatively lower. ""Onion and potato rates have increased. They were 18 and 21 a kilo respectively, and are now 21 and 36 a kilo,"" said Laxmi Shirvoikar, a seller in the horticulture kiosk in Panaji."
336,Veggie prices shatter 'achhe din' dream,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Veggie-prices-shatter-achhe-din-dream/articleshow/37543028.cms,2014-10-29,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: Onion's ability to bring tears to the eyes is again assuming symbolic connotations as prices keep soaring in markets across the city. And, as in previous occasions of such steep hikes, its acrid vapours are not without the whiff of manipulation.When onions are available in the wholesale market just for Rs 16 per kg, retail prices are anything between Rs 30 and Rs 35. As the price of this very basic of ingredients of the Indian kitchen rises, matters are being made worse for middleclass pockets by the rise in prices of vegetables. Price of potatoes has soared to Rs 18 and there is the real possibility that it will rise further. The 'achhe din' that people had started dreaming of before the polls now seems a distant possibility.To make the matter worse, chief minister Mamata Banerjee's initiative to control vegetable prices by setting up of 'fair price' shops - the last resort for aam aadmi - in Municipal markets is not yielding results.""We are selling onions at Rs 800 per sack (50 kg). A few days back, prices had soared to Rs 930 but that has come down because of huge amount of onions coming in from Rajasthan and Nasik. The price is likely to come down further,"" said Haradhan Das, a wholesale trader at Sealdah market on Monday.Gopal Kundu, a retailer at Lake Market, painted a different picture. ""We are buying at Rs 24 or Rs 26 and have no alternative but to sell at Rs 30 or more.""Arup Roy, minister for Agricultural Marketing, smells a rat though. ""There are people involved and they are neither wholesalers nor retailers, and they are jacking up prices,"" Roy told TOI. ""We had a meeting on June 23 where the chief minister instructed the task force to become more active and nab those who are creating this artificial crisis. There is no shortage of onions and the difference in price between the wholesale and the retail market is surprising. We are putting our best effort to streamline the price of vegetables and onions in the city,"" he added.Mangalmay Haldar, a vegetable trader in Lake Market, disagreed. He felt onion prices might shoot up further during the year. ""There is a shortage in supply and that is pushing onion prices up,"" he said. While retailers in Lake Market are buying onion at a price of Rs 30 per kg, they are selling it at Rs 35 now. ""Even a week back we were buying at Rs 25 per kg and was being sold at Rs 30,"" he said.According to Uttam Mukherjee, a supervisor at Kolay market, wholesale prices have gone up from Rs 16-20 per kg to Rs 25-30 in last one week. But Gurupada Sinha, one of the traders in Posta Bazar, said onion prices have been soaring for last few weeks. ""Even during the last week, onion was priced at Rs 700 per 40-kg bag. Within a week it is hovering around Rs 1,000 now,"" he said. According to him, while there was a good crop in Maharashtra at the beginning of the year, the harvest got damaged due to sowing time. ""We have been facing a shortage so far. I think situation will be eased a little after a month or so. We will have crop from the southern states then,"" he said.Also surprising is that prices of vegetables differ from market to market. When brinjal is being sold at the Manicktala market for Rs 40 a kg, it is Rs 50 at the College Street Market and Rs 55 at Lake Market. This is true for other vegetables like striped gourd, ridged gourd, ladies finger, chilli, cauliflower, cabbage, papaya and tomato.""If the retailers purchased it directly from the wholesaler the price would have been same all over but the main problem is created by the middleman. These people make the market unstable. We are trying to raise a team that will make regular visits to the retail markets and check prices. Once the mechanism starts functioning we will be able to streamline prices,"" promised Roy."

Hoarders have become active following predictions of less rainfall,"" he said at a press conference here.""Probably hoarders think the Centre is just giving a statement. They will realize after July 4 how government acts tough to control prices,"" he warned.He said the government has enough stock of wheat and rice to meet foodgrain requirements of the country for a year. Besides, there is sufficient stock of onions and potatoes also. The present shortage was artificial. On the issue of inflation, Paswan said the government was trying to improve the system and it was committed to take stern action to keep the prices under control."

These coming in close succession would hit the common man hard.Political parties here came down heavily on the Centre, while consumers expressed their helplessness over skyrocketing of prices. ""It seems there is no respite from price rise. Vegetable and fruits were almost unreachable, while petrol and diesel are turning unaffordable. Every family is going to be hit hard. I am at my wit's end how to save for the education of my children and health expenses,"" said Smrutirekha Jena, a homemaker.Price of non-subsidized LPG was hiked on Tuesday by Rs 16.50 per 14.2 kg cylinder, which customers buy after using their quota of 12 subsidized cylinders. Consumers in the state have to pay Rs 922 instead of Rs 902 a cylinder now. This came a day after price of petrol was increased by Rs 1.69 paisa a litre.PCC president Jaydev Jena held the NDA government responsible for the unchecked rise in prices of essential commodities. ""Two days ago petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan assured people that there would be no rise in LPG price in the next three months. It seems he misled the people. The NDA government came to power by criticizing price rise, but has failed to check it. Strangely, prices of all essential commodities including rail fare, have been increased in the last one month,"" Jena said. He alleged the state government, being hand in glove with the Centre, had chosen to remain mum on the price rise issue.The BJD youth wing, BYJD, however said it would launch strong protest against price rise. ""There is no difference between UPA and NDA on the issue of price rise. The increase in prices on host of commodities has all but exposed the real face of NDA,"" said BYJD secretary Bijay Nayak.Samajwadi Party state president Rabi Behera described the price rise as a 'direct attack on the kitchen of common men'. ""People of Odisha will suffer most as the state government has increased VAT on petrol and diesel from 18% to 20% as well,"" he said.The state government on Tuesday asked all district collectors to review stocks of potato and onion and launch crackdown on hoarders. ""Government is alert on the rising prices of potato and onion and is taking steps to keep them under control,"" said food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma.""The government is contemplating to relax one per cent cess collected from vegetable and fruits transporting vehicles by Regulated Market Committees. Collectors will ensure that the difference between wholesale and retail price must not exceed from Rs 2.50 on potato and Rs 3.50 on onion,"" the minister added."

However, administration said that the wholesale rate of onions may go up to Rs 40 per kg in August.But, there was a massive difference in retail prices across the city. In south Delhi's Gautam Nagar, onions were being sold for Rs 20 per kg against Rs 30 per kg in east and central Delhi.""The best quality onion sold for Rs 25 per kg in the Azadpur wholesale market while the lowest was Rs 13.75 per kg,"" sources at Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) said. The APMC also took out an advertisement indicating prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes at Mother Dairy outlets and their wholesale rates.Development commissioner Puneet Goel held a meeting with APMC officials on Tuesday, after which the government decided to set up 40 stalls across the city where onions and potatoes would be sold at wholesale rates. The number of stalls will be increased to 200 within two weeks.""Arrival of onions and potatoes in Delhi has been more than the requirement. On Tuesday, 1,200 MT of onions and 1,299 MT of potatoes arrived in the capital, which is much more than the daily requirement of Delhi,"" said Goel.Government premises, from where the sale is proposed, include the offices of food and supply officers, offices of the development department, district magistrates, SDMs and inquiry offices of Delhi Jal Board, said Goel.Anil Malhotra, committee member of APMC, said that the 70 tempos going into the city with onions and potatoes were returning with some amount of stock each night, indicating that there was sufficient supply in the city and rates had not risen.""We intend on having the 200 stalls in place till at least September or till prices remain high. These stalls will sell other expensive vegetables as well. A rise in onion prices is expected but that should happen in August. If the rain is delayed further, the high prices will remain till October,"" he said.Surinder Sawhney, proprietor of Gujarat Onion Co said that April 15 to September 15 is a lean period for onions and they are often stocked to meet the demand then."

Western India is expected to be worst affected and drought-like situation might prevail in some pockets,"" agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh was quoted as saying in a PTI report.The assessment will add to inflationary pressures the government is grappling with. In fact, the cabinet on Wednesday is slated to consider a proposal to make 5 million tons of food grain available to states as a measure to keep food prices in check.Though the Met has predicted an improved monsoon from July 6, the July 4-8 forecast does not predict rain in many areas of western India though monsoon activity is expected to increase along the west coast.Area under kharif crops last week decreased to 131.52 lakh hectares from 200.96 lakh hectares as compared to last year. Some states have issued specific advisories to farmers to delay sowing and not tap ground water just yet.The minister's comments reflect the assessment that a delayed and sub-normal monsoon will hurt states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh more given their higher dependence on rains to sustain crops.A Vidarbha farmer waiting for monsoon to strike. (TOI photo by Aniruddha Singh Dinore)These areas, along with north west India, are likely to receive less rains. But unlike Haryana and Punjab their irrigation networks are not so widespread or as well supplied. Canals and intermittent rains have ensured comfortable ground water levels in north west India where farmers tap this resource during sowing and cultivation.Singh said Maharashtra's Vidarbha region  prone to farm distress as rains are crucial to moderating temperatures  is likely to be hit by the lack of rainfall.""Vidharbha region is drought-prone. We will think of all possible measures to help farmers so that they are not forced to commit suicides due to crop failure,"" said Singh. These measures include providing diesel and seed subsidies.Drought in Maharashtra's Sangli in 2012. (TOI file photo by Uma Kadam)The minister, however, said that the IMD has predicted a pick up in the monsoon around July 6, and if this were to happen the shortfall in kharif sowing will be made good.IMD's Tuesday reports said that the monsoon has arrived in Himachal and Uttarkhand and parts of UP and is due to reach Delhi shortly. As compared to the normal progress by July 1, the monsoon is lagging in eastern Madhya Pradesh, east and north Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana.Having recorded a shortfall of 43 per cent in June, the monsoon is likely to be fairly active over north-east and east India.

Also in pockets of Arunachal, Assam and north interior Karnataka.He also said the agriculture ministry will soon move a Cabinet note on providing diesel and seed subsidy if states declare drought in some areas.On vegetable prices rising in anticipation of a poor monsoon, Singh said, ""We have to improve the supply system, though there is no shortage in onion and potato production in the country.""On Tuesday, the consumer affairs department tweeted, ""Onion ruling high Rs 28-34/kg in 4 metros frm Rs 22-29/kg 2 weeks ago. Potato fell to Rs 22/kg in Chennai frm Rs 26, but rise to Rs 27/kg in Delhi.""Earlier in the day a delegation-led by Maharashtra BJP president Devendra Fadanvis informed Singh about the situation in the Vidharbha region and sought special measures to tackle the possible drought this year.According to the India Meteorological Department, the monsoon this year is expected to be 93 per cent of the long-term average. For the country as a whole, the cumulative rainfall up to June 25 was 40 per cent below the average. Conditions are expected to improve in July and August."

Seasonal vegetables like lady finger, capsicum and brinjal, etc make up the usual meals. Besides, fruit is in high demand. While onion prices have nearly doubled, tomato prices have gone up by around 80%, potato 30-40% and garlic by 25%.""We are a family of four and according to my calculation, this price hike has resulted in additional burden of around Rs 1,000 per month,"" said Arif Siddiqui, a teacher.

342,Farmers stocking onion expecting delayed harvest,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Farmers-stocking-onion-expecting-delayed-harvest/articleshow/37663435.cms,2014-10-31,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Farmers and traders seem to be stocking onion as analysts forecast that the next crop from Maharashtra may get delayed by a month or two. Usually, the harvest reaches the mandis by October. Even during last crisis in October when onion prices had reached Rs 100 per kg, the consumer affairs department had pointed out that with better storage facility now farmers could be storing more.Sources in consumer affairs department said state governments woke up late to the onion and potato price rise despite the department writing twice in May this year to all states to come out with their draft orders on control limits on stock limiting and regulation for food items. But not a single state responded. ""Since we are aware this crisis occurs every year, we had written to them on May 4 and again on May 25. They showed no interest. We had said that once they send the draft order to us we will give concurrence,"" said an official.A source in National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) said they are ""absolutely clueless"" why the supply to big mandis in Maharashtra has reduced despite the fact that there is huge stock of onions. ""Ideally prices should not rise considering the bumper harvest this year. But traders may be stocking it to maximize profit because of likely delay in fresh harvest of onion. Though some fresh supply from southern states like Andhra Pradesh have started reaching, it's not enough,"" he added.The official said that with the fresh decision on fixing stock limit on both onion and potato, the state government would now intensify their crackdown on hoarders. However, there is a little fear whether traders would then prefer to keep their ""bought"" material with the farmers for some days or weeks to avoid any such crackdown. This is because farmer being the producer cannot be targeted.The wholesale prices of onion at Lasalgoan in Maharashtra, Asia's largest onion market, have risen by about 80% to Rs 18.50 per kg last month."
343,"Onion, potato now essential items; stocks to be capped",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Onion-potato-now-essential-items-stocks-to-be-capped/articleshow/37666390.cms,2014-10-31,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: As part of its efforts to clamp down on hoarding of onions and potatoes and rein in their prices, the Centre on Wednesday empowered states to fix a limit on the quantities of the kitchen staples that can be held in stock.Currently, stock limits have been imposed for pulses, edible oils and oilseeds till September 2014, while these norms are applicable up to November for rice and paddy.Stock limits for onions and potatoes  part of 22 essential commodities  will be re-imposed after a gap of 12 years with the Union Cabinet on Wednesday deciding to arm the state governments to carry out de-hoarding operations.The previous NDA government had in 2002 done away with stock limits on essential commodities.The decision is part of urgent measures, including facilitating increased availability of onions and potatoes through government and private outlets and raids on suspected hoarders, undertaken by the government in wake of reports of a large divergence between wholesale and retail prices.The decision comes after over half a dozen state governments, including NDA-ruled Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, wrote to the Centre to revoke the ban on stock limits so that action could be taken against hoarders, black marketers and speculators more effectively.A deficient monsoon in June and reports of likely drought-like conditions in some states have also acted to spur hoarding and a speculative rise in prices.The Centre's action is also aimed at sending a strong signal to state consumer affairs ministers that the ball is now in their court and they cannot complain that their options are limited. More powers to act against hoarding, the Centre hopes, will create pressure on states to act firmly against price rise.Finance minister Arun Jaitley will also chair the meeting of state ministers on Friday where changes in the agriculture produce marketing committee act will be discussed.Sources said that consumer affairs department has already finalized a draft notification, which would be published quickly so that states can start acting. Now it's up to the state governments to decide the cap keeping in mind the demand and likely availability of the fresh produce. Officials said the limit may differ from state to state.""States expected to take firm, effective measures to enforce stock holding limit on onion and potato. State governments will decide the stock limit in their respective states...We think there are enough potatoes and onions in the country and there's no need to panic,"" Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said after the Cabinet meeting.He also added that the government will keep close watch on stocks of onions, other essentials to tackle price rise. ""Our government is committed to control inflation,"" Prasad said.In yet another decision, the government increased minimum export price (MEP) of onions to $500 (Rs 30,000) per tonne to curb the prices and to push supply in local markets. Last month the MEP fixed was $300 (Rs 18,000) per tonne.Apart from these measures, the Centre has already advised states to delist fruits and vegetables from the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act so that farmers can have the option of selling their produce in the open market themselves apart from using the traditional mandi set up.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs also approved additional allocation for 50 lakh tonnes of rice for distribution to below poverty line (BPL) families at BPL prices and above poverty line (APL) price for the period July, 2014 to March, 2015 or till implementation of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) by the respective state/ UT whichever is earlier.This will mitigate the problems of the people due to inflation in food prices, particularly in those states/ UTs where the NFSA has not been implemented so far. Sources said that the share of state governments will be based on the number of people getting grains through PDS."
344,Food inflation: Of onion tears and potato fears,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Food-inflation-Of-onion-tears-and-potato-fears/articleshow/37660140.cms,2014-10-31,The Times Of India,"Government deserves compliments for its timely assault on surging food prices. Well begin is half done. But it must be taken to its logical conclusion lest it fizzles-out half way. It is critical to understand what else needs to be put in place to give full benefits to farmers and consumers alike.In May 2014, food inflation, measured by wholesale price index (WPI), increased by 6.5% over May 2013; its sub-component food-articles, registered an inflation of 9.5%. Government monitors daily price movements of 22 selected food commodities, ranging from cereals and cereal products (rice, wheat and atta), pulses (gram, tur, urad, moong and masur), edible oils (groundnut, mustard, vanaspati, sunflower, soya, and palm), sugar and gur, vegetables (onion, potato and tomato) and tea, milk and salt. The price rise has been highest in potatoes (31.4%) making it the hottest, followed by moong (26.9 %), masur (15.6 %), urad (14.8 %), rice (12.8%), and milk (9.6 %), etc.Onion is an interesting case. As per WPI numbers, onion prices were 2.8% lower in May 2014 than in May 2013. Then why did government put a minimum export price (MEP) on onions at $300/MT? The answer perhaps lies in the discrepancy of onion price data collected by government under WPI and the other gathered by a private agency, Agriwatch. Agriwatch, which prepares daily reports for Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), shows that monthly average wholesale onion prices in May 2014 over May 2013 went up by 21.8% in Bangalore, 20.5% in Lasalgaon, 23.6% in Pimplagaon, and 19.2% in Mumbai. The damage caused to rabi onion crop due to untimely rains and hails in April- May this year, and scarcity of onion seeds, is perhaps behind this surge, which is likely to peak in October-November. These trends have set alarm bells ringing for policy makers, and no wonder, government has announced a slew of measures to check these prices.Government has already started cracking-down on hoarders. It may give a temporary respite. But past experience suggests that it may not be a medium to long term solution. In a market economy, better policy tools to tame hoarders are liberal import policies, coupled with high priority to processed food that help stabilize prices. In case of onions particularly, dehydrated onions with a shelf life of more than a year, could be promoted to large scale institutional consumers like army, mid-day meals schemes, etc., which will help release the pressures on fresh onions during lean periods.Next, the Central government is advising states to de-list fruits and vegetables from APMC Act. Such an advice was also given before elections by Rahul Gandhi to all Congress-ruled states. But not much changed on the ground. Our understanding is that unless PM calls a meeting of all CMs, and takes it up as a part of priority reforms to create a unified all-India market for fruits and vegetables, and where buyers (large or small) can buy directly from farmers/farmer groups, and where private sector has the option to start its own mandis in competition with APMC markets, giving a better choice to farmers, things may not move far enough. It must be recognized that these changes in APMC Act are needed to build compressed and efficient value chains connecting farmers' groups directly with organized retailers, a la AMUL model in milk sector. And this would need massive investments and institutional engineering. The benefits would accrue in terms of savings on wastages, which hover around 15-30%, and reduction in commissions of commission agents, wholesalers and retailers, which together account for 30-50% in fruits and vegetables in the current fragmented value chains.Nevertheless, if government de-lists fruits and vegetables from India's largest mandi at Azadpur in Delhi, which was overdue for more than 10 years, it could be a harbinger of agri-marketing reforms in the country.Third, the government has announced liquidating five million tonnes of rice stocks, through PDS at APL prices. However, the problem is that the existing PDS has leakages running at about 40%. E-auctions in the open market, with a reserve price equivalent to MSP plus say 5%, could have been a better option and at lower cost to the treasury. This could be experimented with by announcing government's plans to liquidate 5-7 million tonnes of wheat in July-August. This would have sobering impact on cereal prices.In addition, it would be better to expand the list of sensitive commodities beyond 22, by including fruits, eggs, fish and meat, etc., where demand pressures are mounting with rising incomes. The price of bananas is up by 19%, and eggs, fish and meat by 12.5%. But their import duties are above 30%. Again, a liberal import policy along with building effective value chains can help the government to douse fire of food prices.(Gulati is chair professor and Saini a consultant at Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations)"
345,Farmers seek Centreâ€™s help,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1141031/jsp/northeast/story_18981845.jsp,2014-10-31,Telegraph,"Palit Kumar Bora speaks at the news conference on Thursday. Picture by UB Photos Jorhat, Oct. 30: Kisan Morcha, the BJP wing for farmers, has sought intervention by the Centre into a number of problems being faced by the farming community, including non-issuance of miyadi pattas (landownership documents) on about 50 per cent of land being tilled, in the state. Central Committee secretary Palit Kumar Bora, addressing a news conference here today, blamed the Congress for not acting in this regard alleging that middlemen in the process were reaping all the benefits. Crops are cultivated on 34 lakh hectares of land and of this about 17 lakh hectares are being cultivated but the farmer does not have ownership rights. We are demanding that the rights be given to the farmer so that they can avail of the benefits given to the community. In the absence of land ownership, middlemen are reaping the benefits in the name of these farmers, he said. The morcha demands allowing government land, which was not being used, to set up enterprises like poultry, piggery or dairy by self-help groups. Citing an example, Bora said, The Kaliapani dairy farm near Teok in the district had become defunct. This could be given to some group which is interested in setting up another dairy, he said. Bora said the Kisan Morcha would take up other issues in which youths or self-help groups could further develop. In this regard he said a group of about 40 dairy farmers of Parbatiya village near Pulibar here who produce 450 litres of milk daily lacked electricity, which could help them set up a cold storage. Despite repeated applications, three poles, which are required for the electric cables to be drawn to the area are yet to be installed, he said. The morcha wants insurance for farmers be fast tracked so that when they suffer losses during floods and droughts, they would have some thing to fall back on. Bora came down heavily on the Assam Seed Corporation, which he said was a white elephant. Alleging corruption in the state agriculture department, Bora said the Assam Seed Corporation more often than not procured substandard quality of seeds for farmers here as a result of which despite the fertile soil and climate the produce was less. In Assam, we produce only 12 to 15 quintals of potatoes per hectare whereas in other states this is 20 to 24 quintals. This is because of the poor quality of the seeds, he alleged. Some other demands were in regard to fixing the green tea leaf price and provision of mini factories for small tea growers and greater area to be brought under irrigation."

Growers want the average minimum price fixed at Rs. 200 a kg., considering the expenditure and the hours of work spent on cultivating the crop, said H. Yoga Ramesh, president of the club.Speaking to presspersons at Arkalgud on Wednesday, Mr. Ramesh said that for many years, the growers had been seeking remunerative price for tobacco. However, neither the Tobacco Board nor the elected representatives had bothered to consider the demand.The government responds to the problems of other farmers, if they suffer loss either due to drought or heavy rain.However, the problems of tobacco growers remain unresolved.The protest is to make the government think about this section of farmers, who are being cheated for many years, he said."

The state on its part has sought amendments to the Essential Commodities Act to make the violation of its provisions a non-bailable offence. Delhi also wants that punishment must be made more stringent.Home minister Rajnath Singh, at a meeting with LG Najeeb Jung on Thursday, reviewed the prices of essential commodities, including onions, potatoes and tomatoes, in the capital. The price of onions has increased to around Rs 30 a kg in the retail market in Delhi as against Rs 21 last month and potatoes are being sold for Rs.28 a kg approximately as against around Rs 22 last month.Singh said the number of mobile vans selling essential commodities will be increased from 60 to 200 and the number of outlets selling onions (at Rs 20 a kg) and potatoes (at Rs 18 a kg) on government premises will be increased from 40 to 300. The rates of onions and potatoes in Delhi are stable. The wholesale price is between Rs13 and Rs 25 and the retail price between Rs18 and Rs 30 in different areas.Onions are being sold at Rs 27 per kg and potatoes at Rs 24.50 per kg at the Safal outlets. The rates of onions have been lower than the rates in the corresponding period last year, it was pointed out. The arrivals of onions and potatoes is more than the requirement of Delhi, it is claimed. Today 1,276 MT of onions and 1011 MT of potatoes arrived in the mandis.""As a follow-up to the instructions for raiding suspected hoarders, 540 places have been searched,"" Rajnath Singh told reporters. He said 1082 raids were carried out last month."

Local traders have demanded a ban on export of potatoes to Pakistan, especially in the wake of the neighbouring country stopping export of onions to India.""We have normal demand and supply till now. But buyers panicked hearing sensational media reports that onions are bringing tears in the eyes of people and potatoes would reach Rs 40 per kg. So anyone requiring 5 kg is now buying 15 kg. In many cases, a few families have even bought 100 kg bags,"" wholesale vegetable dealer Gaurav Behal told TOI. Onion was being sold in the wholesale market between Rs 8 and Rs 17 per kg while potatoes were being sold for Rs 16-20 per kg, he said.President of the Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruits Commercial Association and a foreign trader, Anil Mehra, said the government should put a ban on export of potatoes to Pakistan, which was causing rise in prices in the domestic market. Almost 100 truckloads of potatoes were being exported to Pakistan via Attari due to its immense demand there in the month of Ramazan. Pakistan had already imposed a ban on export of onions to India to meet its domestic demand, he said.""If onion prices reached Rs 20-22 per kg, then traders could import the bulbous crop from Afghanistan, though it was not of good quality,"" Gaurav said. A custom clearing agent, Jaspal Singh, said that importers had to see the feasibility. ""According to my information, onion and potato prices in Pakistan were also on the rise and in that case, importing them from there may not be profitable,"" he said."

The prices, which had already climbed up by 25-50% about two months ago, posted similar hike on Thursday. The rates of vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes and onions are flying high in the markets and are expected to go still higher in the coming days.Hotelier Murthy said tomato prices have shot up drastically. ""A fortnight ago, I had brought them for Rs 8- 10, but now it has gone up to Rs 30-40. Even many vegetables are witnessing a high price. I have reduced the quantity of vegetable pulao, though demand is high for the item. But I cannot serve them at the usual normal price now,"" he said, adding that burden is high on people who run eateries like him.Shanthamma, a homemaker, said though prices are high, quality of vegetables is low. Shopping for vegetables at the Doddakere market, she griped, ""I am not getting good quality tomato and many vegetables are bad. Sellers say they don't get vegetables. I have reduced the quantity of vegetables to manage my budget. Prices are too high. I purchased only a kilo of tomato, beans and few bunches of green leaves and they cost me Rs 100.""Other than tomatoes, potatoes and onions, prices of many other vegetables are also seeing drastic hike as the supply has been severely affected. Retailers and wholesalers said vegetables arriving in the wholesale market declined around 25-30% than normal, thereby pushing the prices by 25-50%. Though the quality of vegetables is low due to drought situation and diseases, prices are high due to lack of supply, they say.Kumar, a retailer at Devaraja Market, said farmers and vegetable suppliers are anticipating tough situation leading to escalation in prices. ""The rates of tomatoes, onions, potatoes and carrots have almost doubled in last 15 days,"" he said.Prices normally go up due to monsoon season and month of Aashada. But this hike is due to uncertainty over rains and due to diseases like root rots. Low quality seeds are the reason for various diseases, said a farmer and wholeseller, Siddaraju from Airahalli.Another retailer Manju from Bilikere said the increase in cost of transportation had also contributed to rise in prices. ""Increased goods vehicle charges and hike in petrol and diesel rates have also forced the retailers to hike the prices,"" he said.Hopcoms managing director K D Krishnamurthy says it is demand versus supply factor that is playing. There is no problem for market, but supply hits the market due to delay in rains, poor quality of seedlings. ""Compared to last month there is around 25% to 30% rise in price of various vegetables. Tomatoes, potatoes and onions are at worst hit,"" he said, predicting the prices may further go up.The rise in onion prices is due to heavy demand in neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu, Andra Pradesh and Kerala, he said, adding, ""Hundreds of tonnes of onion are exported to neighbouring states causing huge demand,"" he said. Only good monsoon can bring back the situation back to normal, he opined."

Ministry sources said since all powers under the Essential Commodities Act have been delegated to the states, they can take extreme steps including the price fixation for sale of the commodities.On Thursday, the department brought back onion under the Act, which was done away with by the UPA government in November 2004. It also included potato under the law for the first time. Though the earlier NDA government had proposed to bring both the items under the Act, in 1999 only onion was included.Sources said though the department had moved a proposal to restore the old provision in 2005, the law ministry said there was no need for fresh order since the EC Act covers all food stuff including the ingredients that are used for final food product.""However, once these are declared as essential commodities under the law with greater clarity, the states are now free to take all necessary steps under the law. They can't any more blame the Centre for their inaction or failure to check price rise when there is enough stock of these items,"" a department official said.Meanwhile, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Thursday said, ""We see onion prices rising every year during the June- September period. This cyclical price rise can be avoided if we can create 15-20 godowns.""At a time when there is serious thinking to liberalize APMC regime for free sale of commodities outside mandis, Karnataka has set an example by introducing large-scale agricultural marketing reforms. Under the new law with just one licence a trader can operate in all of its regulated market yards. Moreover, even a warehouse can be treated as a market yard and thereby enabling farmers to sell their items near their villages. According to analysts, this model will kill the monopoly of a few traders who have been in the business for generations as more traders mean more competition. This will also help farmers to get better price in the bargain."

He said the state government should dehoard onion and potato stocks stashed in godowns, arrange sale of the two products through its outlets preferably at milk depots which are available across the state and ensure the perishable product, especially onion, reach the consumers properly.Nand Kishore, while talking to newsmen outside the assembly, said onion produced in Patna and Nalanda districts are usually sent to eastern and north eastern states, but no truck carrying the product are moving out of the two districts because of the ban on movement of heavy vehicles on Ganga bridges. ""The state government should ensure the perishable commodity like onion reaches the consumers as even the farmers are not able to stock them for longer period,"" he said.He further said the price rise in the state is artificial. ""In fact, prices of potato and onion in the wholesale market in Patna have not increased, but these are being sold at higher prices in retail outlets. The state government should ensure the maximum permissible limits of the two products at the retail outlets too,"" Nand Kishore said and advised the government to arrange the sale of onion and potato through its retail outlets preferably at milk depots.Earlier, the RJD members entered the well of the assembly as soon as the question hour began, carrying posters alleging Narendra Modi government responsible for rising prices. RJD legislature party leader Abdul Bari Sidiqqui moved a notice seeking adjournment of the normal business of the House to discuss rising prices of onion and potato. He, however, supported the Centre's decision to take stern action against hoarders and persons involved in keeping the two products on the back market.Sidiqqui asked the state government to file criminal cases against hoarders and persons involved in keeping potato and onion on the black market. Bhai Birendra of RJD, who was also one of the signatories of the notice seeking adjournment, said the price rise is artificial due to the large-scale hoarding by middlemen.The assembly speaker, however, rejected the adjournment notice."

If it is found that traders are hoarding more than the prescribed limit, they can be fined and in some cases even prosecuted,"" said food supplies and consumer welfare secretary Madhusudan Padhi.The stock limit provision will help Odisha as it is a big importer of onion and potato. ""More anti-hoarding operations will help improve availability, thereby controlling prices. This is a check and balance system. Hoarding and widening demand-supply gap are major reasons for price rise,"" Padhi said, adding, ""Odisha depends on other states for about 80% of its total potato requirement and 70% of onion requirement.""In the last few weeks, the prices of onion and potato have skyrocketed. On Saturday, the wholesale price of potato was Rs 1,420 a quintal and that of onion was Rs 2,400 to Rs 2,500 a quintal. To check the price rise, the state had earlier decided that the difference between wholesale and retail prices should not exceed Rs 2.50 a kg for potato and Rs 3.50 a kg for onion. However, in retail markets potato and onion are selling at Rs 18 to 20 a kg and Rs 28 to 30 a kg respectively.President of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said, ""Odisha being a consumer state, the stock limit provision will not help it much. Instead it will create trouble in the long run. Traders in Odisha are not in a position to hoard as our demand is more than supply. Most traders order stocks more than the requirement sensing some crisis like short supply, bad weather or transport problem.""The state requires 3,000 tonne of potato and 1,000 tonne of onion every day. Odisha produced 4.32 lakh tonne of onion in 2013-14 and 4.19 lakh tonne in 2012-13. Potato production in the state is around 2 lakh tonne an annum against the requirement of 9.72 lakh tonne. Due to lack of storage facilities a large quantity of onion and potato go waste every year, official sources said."

As the government cracks down on onion and potato 'hoarders', neither the Centre nor the Delhi government has fixed any limit on the quantity of these items that a trader can store without facing charges of hoarding.The government is yet to define hoarding for any vegetable, including potatoes and onions, said Rajendra Sharma, former chairman of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee, Azadpur Mandi.However, a senior government official said that now that onions and potatoes have been brought under the Essential Commodities Act, the government would fix limits on the size of stocks that vegetable traders can maintain.Since these limits are yet to be declared, the purpose of the recent raids at more than 500 premises is not very clear. The government official said the raids were conducted to curb hoarding of items such as pulses. However, Rajendra Sharma alleged that the raids were conducted to mislead the public and show that the government was serious about controlling prices.Sharma added that traders in the capital depend on daily supply of both the items. As these items cannot be stored for more than a week without keeping them in cold storage, hoarding is risky. If hoarding does take place, it is by traders close to areas where potato and onion is produced and by big farmers themselves who wait for an opportune time to sell the produce.This was also proved in the recent raids when no hoarding of unreasonably large quantities of both items was found, Sharma added.Traders at the Azadpur Mandi warned that imposition of ESMA on onions and potatoes could be counter productive. It might lead to further price rise, they said. If the limit on the amount that a trader is allowed to store is fixed low, traders would reduce the amount bought daily by them, in order to avoid ESMA will.Traders argued that if the government wanted to control prices of potato and onion, it must prohibit exports of both items. India produced around 19 million tonnes (MT) of onions in 2013-14 as against 17 MT in 2012-13. Out of the 19 MT production, 1.5 MT were exported in 2013-14."

During UPA 2, minister for consumer affairs K V Thomas told the Lok Sabha 11 different times that state governments had been told to seriously tackle inflation by acting against hoarders and black marketeers.This is what was repeated in Friday's meeting of state food ministers where finance minister Arun Jaitley urged the states to tackle ""hoarding, cartelization and artificial storages"". To be fair, Jaitley declared that the central government would be working in close coordination with the state governments, thus lending a certain heft to the plan. But is that enough?To be true, the NDA government has also brought potatoes and onions in the essential commodities list, as well as moved to make hoarding a non-bailable offence. This may discourage hoarding, but the record of the state governments in tackling hoarders and black marketeers in the past few years is dismal. And the Modi government is dealing with the very same state governments as did UPA 2.From data supplied by state governments to the consumer affairs ministry, and from answers to Parliament queries, it turns out that between 2008 and 2013, a total of 26,472 persons were prosecuted under the Essential Commodities Act, the Prevention of Black-marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act and rules flowing from it. This was after nearly 11 lakh raids were carried out and nearly Rs 1,200 crore worth of commodities were confiscated.But the most worrisome part is: Only 2,484 people were actually convicted. That's a conviction rate of less than 10%. It's unlikely to deter hoarders and black marketeers, especially if they are the big fish.""Regulatory chaos has prevailed in the states,"" explained a senior state government official in the food and civil supplies department, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the UPA reign, a series of orders were passed dismantling or restricting the rules on how much stocks could be kept and other aspects. Even the judiciary struck down actions taken on various technical grounds, the official said.""But the main thing was that officials were hesitant to act because no political will was there,"" he said.The data on raids and prosecution gives a glimpse of the chaos. Several states have not been submitting any information at all  like Madhya Pradesh has not submitted any report after 2008, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand have not reported from even before and many other states have given patchy reports, omitting some months here and there.Will all this sound and fury in Delhi force the state governments to act tough on hoarders? Experts are skeptical, going by past record. P G Chengappa, former vice-chancellor of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore says that the experience of declaring ""essential commodity"" and managing ""stock"" has met with little success.""It is ideal to improve the marketing efficiency by strict enforcement of trading practices and break the cartel by allowing more commission agents,"" he told TOI.AV Manjunath of the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bangalore, who was one of the co-authors of a 2012 report on onion markets in India brought out by the Competition Commission, said that to improve market efficiency market infrastructure and allowing new commission agents are necessary. ""Strong Institutions are essential to penalize those who are involved in speculative hoarding and cartelization,"" he told TOI."

""There is not enough stock at the market yards from where Goa procures its onions,"" said A Prabhu, a wholesaler in the Panaji market.A retailer attributed the increased price to unstable weather conditions. ""It's been more than a month since steady rainfall, and we can't do anything about it,"" said Ravi, a vegetable retailer who has been in the business for about 39 years.Some consumers felt that wholesalers stock up a portion of the vegetables they receive and sell them when the prices rise. Big hotels buy vegetables from wholesalers in bulk at a cheaper rate but when it comes to locals purchasing these for daily consumption, they are sometimes left with no choice but to buy them expensive, said Pushpa, a Panaji local. Good quality onions are being sold between 38-40 per kg while small-sized ones are available at 35-36 per kg.Most vegetables in the market including cauliflower ( 40 each), carrots ( 50 per kg) and potatoes (35 per kg) have suffered an increase in price as well. On the other hand, the rates of French beans have had a happy drop from 120 to 90.

September 2014 data on wholesale food price inflation showed a major respite: food articles WPI increasing by only 3.5% and food products by 3% over September 2013 WPI. With food prices coming under control, everyone wants to claim the credit. RBI feels that its tight monetary policy is finally paying off while the Finance Ministry feels their tight fiscal policy along with some reforms on food front  from decision to liquidate 15 MMT of grains from FCI stocks to amending APMC Act in Delhi (de-listing fruits and vegetables from it) to raids on onion traders  have all paid off. The BJP announces the arrival of 'acchhe din'!In this chorus of self-congratulatory messages, a major factor influencing domestic food prices is being forgotten. And that is the tumbling food prices in the global markets getting transmitted into the Indian market. We are not insulated from the global commodity developments. The corn and wheat prices have crashed in response to the bumper harvests in US. The corn prices were at least 25% lower in September 2014 over May 2014 levels, while wheat prices were 27% lower over the same period. Palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia is down by 21% in September over May 2014 period, and so is cotton 'A' index by 21%. Soyabean prices are down by 17% over the same period, September over May, 2014. These are the biggest falls in global food prices in the last four years, basically since the peak of food prices in February 2011. Only notable exception is rice, which has ducked this trend so far. Is it the beginning of a bear cycle in global commodity markets or is it an isolated and an unsustainable episode of price moderation, remains an open question.What is the impact of this global price fall on domestic prices? We feel this is a major reason behind softening of domestic food prices. India is one of the largest importer of edible oils, importing about 10-11 MMT, much of which is palm oil. Its declining prices in global markets will quickly reflect in domestic markets, unless import duties are jacked up. India has been a net exporter of corn, wheat and cotton over the last few years. Corn exports, which usually hover around 4-5 MMT will have difficult time, creating a glut in domestic markets and pushing domestic prices down. Since corn is the primary feed material for poultry, one should also expect softening of eggs and meat prices in the days to come. So would be the case of wheat. India missed a golden opportunity of exporting 10-15 MMT of wheat in the time window of January to March 2014, when global prices hovered around $300/MT. Our lethargy in exporting wheat will now cost the nation heavily in terms of carrying excessive stocks of grains in FCI godowns. India has been exporting about 10 million bales of cotton annually, but this year exporting cotton to China will be difficult, putting downward pressure on domestic market prices. Therefore, in the coming months, one should expect further fall in domestic food and fiber inflation.But what about fruits and vegetables, especially onions and potatoes, which were bringing tears to common man? Surprisingly, onion prices have been contained well within Rs 30/kg in retail markets. Compared to last September, its prices are 58% lower in September 2014. That is a very good news and with the arrival of its kharif crop, the prices will go down further. However, potato is still a problem, whose prices are 90% higher in September 2014 over September 2013. Reducing its import duty from 30 to 0% and allowing imports of potatoes could be a solution in the short run. However, the commodity being bulky, not much imports are likely to be viable. Inflation in fruits prices still hovers at 21%, which is troubling. Apples attract an import duty of 50%, and most of other fruits too are protected with 30% duty. Streamlining and compressing their value chains, by connecting farmer groups with consumers, and reducing import duties, can help tame inflation in fruits.(Ashok Gulati is chair professor and Shweta Saini a consultant at ICRIER)"

He was remanded in police custody till July 18.Adhikary went into hiding soon after as many as 5,000 investors  who had put in money in the Sumangal Collective Investment Scheme  lodged complaints with Shakespeare Sarani police station alleging that they had been duped of promised returns. Cops had arrested his wife Madhumita, a director of the group, earlier on June 5.A chartered accountant himself, Adhikary amassed huge wealth, including a posh property on Cornfield Road near Ballygunge station by pooling in money under the Flexi Potato Purchase Scheme. Investigators have traced 22 bank accounts that the Sumangal directors used to operate. Of them two are with nationalised banks. Before this, Adhikary  a resident of Magra in Hooghly  used to run a battery manufacturing company, his family business.The company came under the Security and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) scanner a year ago on the ground that Sumangal Group was collecting money under the Collective Investment Scheme (CIS). The company challenged the SEBI observation on the plea that investors used to purchase potatotes directly from farmers.On inquiry, it was found that investors were made to sign a paper authorising the company to store the potato in cold storage and mange the stocks for making profit. SEBI directed the company to stop entering the securities market and prohibited it from buying and selling of potato purchase bonds.Sumangal appealed to the Securities Appellate Tribunal that granted time up to January 2015 to refund the money collected through CIS. Things, however, went worse for Adhikary when his company started defaulting on CIS payments after the 15-month maturity.The potato baron fell into the Special Investigation Team (SIT) net after investigators sealed the bank accounts, making Adhikary run out of sustenance funds. ""We have attached nine properties. They include two cold storages, one at Panagarh and another at Adisaptagram, an eight and half bighas of land at his home town in Magra. Apart from that he had purchased one apartment on Cornfield Road that costs around Rs 6-7 crore. The total value of the assets is estimated at around Rs 35 crore,"" the investigating officer said.According to SIT, Adhikary confessed that he had collected Rs 86 crore from the market out of which he had returned Rs 35 crore. ""Though we have not verified his statement but even if he had returned Rs 35 crore then he had only returned Rs 22-25 crore of the principal amount and the rest is in form of interest because his rate of interest was very high. He has a liability of nearly Rs 66 crore,"" the officer said.""SIT arrested Adhikary for his involvement in the Rs 86-crore 'Flexi Potato Purchase Scheme'. Police started the search based on complaints at Shakespeare Sarani police station. His wife Madhumita was arrested earlier,"" chief public prosecutor Krishna Kumar Das said.Adhikary pleaded with chief metropolitan magistrate Biswarup Seth if his case falls under the jurisdiction of the court when the matter was pending with the Securities Appellate Tribunal."

A notification to this effect was issued on June 19 and feedback can be provided till August 4.""Mandi representatives are meeting regularly to chart out a course of action. Azadpur, Keshopur, Okhla and Ghazipur are working together through their 43 associations. A strike is inevitable and the details are being worked out. The commission agents also have the farmers' support,"" says a source.Finance minister Arun Jaitley had addressed a high-level meeting of ministers and secretaries in June where he instructed states to delist fruits and vegetables from the APMCs to control food inflation. A day later, Delhi lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung announced the government's decision to regulate the market under Section 3 of the Delhi Agriculture Produce Marketing (regulation) Act, 1998. Another order was issued in July to immediately deregulate onions and potatoes.However, commission agents, who will be directly affected, blame the government for the rising costs of food items in Delhi, and warn of utter chaos if the proposal is implemented. ""Till January, we could charge up to 6% as commission. The government asked us to shift this charge from the farmer to the buyer and added a 1% market fee. This amount is being passed on to the consumer. In any case, Delhi doesn't produce onions and potatoes and contributes a miniscule percentage of other vegetables. What is the government trying to control?"" says an agent.Sources say Azadpur Mandi alone records annual sales of Rs 7,000-7,500 crore and has close to 2,200 commission agents. ""How can the farmers manage a business of this scale? Both farmers and traders come to the market and sell through the commission agent. Farmers usually come early in the morning and leave by afternoon. They are paid as and when their goods are sold. Without agents, will farmers be expected to sit in the mandi all through the day? Furthermore, how will they learn about pricing, the national market conditions, etc. Where will they sit? People are not going to visit mandis every day,"" said Mahender Sanpal, a member of APMC.Delhi consumes about 800-900 tonnes of onion daily while around 300 tonnes is sold to other states. Agents say this business too will be affected as a single farmer will not have sufficient stocks for a trader and instead of dealing with multiple people, the wholesale market will shift to another state and cost Delhi massive business.Government sources say these issues will be considered before taking a decision. They, however, acknowledge that this will not be easy."

What is going to happen in the next two months of this government?

The opposition had initially demanded a discussion under an adjournment motion which would have entailed censure and voting.P Karunakaran of CPM, while targeting the NDA government over price rise, also blamed the erstwhile UPA government for failing to take concrete steps to check price rise in the 10 years of its rule. He also suggested that the government cut taxes, excise duty and VAT on petrol in the interest of the common man.Anurag Singh Thakur of BJP tried to turn the tables on Congress and UPA over price rise, stating that it had failed to take adequate control measures despite the issue being debated 17 times in Parliament. He said the NDA had inherited an economic mess from Congress and it was wrong to fault the new government for spiralling prices.Food minister Ram Vilas Paswan came to the defence of the government at the fag end of the proceedings. Listing the measures that his ministry had taken to contain food inflation, he said, ""Between July and October, prices of vegetables generally rise. Even last year, the situation was similar. There was speculation this year that onions could touch Rs 100, but we have contained it. The problem is we have no storage capacity for perishables and market is filled with hoarders and profiteers.""Congress MP from Haryana Deepender Hooda, however, hinted that all profiteers that the government was talking about were actually close to BJP. ""Inflation has shot up in five weeks of this government. Arun Jaitley said the profit margin of intermediaries have almost doubled in this period. Who are these intermediaries? People say they are in touch with you,"" Hooda alleged.Even BJD took on the government with its MP Bhartruhari Mahtab ripping into the measures, such as export curbs and action on hoarders, announced by government. ""Clamping down on exports is not going to bring down prices. Only 1.35 million tonnes out of 19 million tonnes of onion produced in the country gets exported. Similarly, of the 46.3 million tonnes of potatoes produced, we export merely 0.25 million tonnes. Also, these commodities can't be hoarded for more than six months,"" he said."
369,Dry monsoon fires veggie prices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Dry-monsoon-fires-veggie-prices/articleshow/38153072.cms,2014-11-08,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: The delay in monsoon has made vegetables very expensive. Bindu Patel, a resident of Satellite, had gone to the market with Rs 100 to buy vegetables but came back with one kg each of tomato, potato and onion.This year, as there has been virtually no rain so far, vegetable prices have increased by about 40-45% in the retail market. In the wholesale vegetable market, rates have gone up by 15-20%. For example, in June this year, the best quality potato was priced at Rs 13 a kg in the wholesale market but this had increased to Rs 16 a kg on Tuesday. In the retail market, however, vegetable prices have gone up from Rs 20 to nearly Rs 28 a kg in posh localities.Even tomato prices have suddenly doubled. The price of tomato a month back was Rs 15 a kg in wholesale but, on Tuesday, this had risen to Rs 35 a kg. In retail, it was selling at Rs 50 a kg!A trader in Satellite said that the price of tomato in the last two days had increased by Rs 12. Officials say that the delay in monsoon has caused a scare in the market and also among the people. Hence, traders have started storing their produce and this had reduced supply.A trader said on the condition of anonymity that, compared to other parts of the country, production of potato in the state is not bad this year but the crop from Deesa was being diverted to Rajasthan. Usually potato comes to Rajasthan from Agra and some other places in north India. This year, because of reduced production in the North, vegetable prices in Rajasthan are high. Hence traders in Gujarat are diverting the produce to Rajasthan.The high vegetable prices have upset many household budgets in the city.""Earlier I used to cook potatoes with each and every vegetable. But potatoes have become so expensive that I find it difficult to manage the household budget,"" said Patel.Similar views were expressed by Jasmine Patel, a resident of satellite. ""The wholesale rates are also high. I had gone to Kalupur and purchased vegetables for the entire week. But the prices are high and are increasing. In the retail market just close to Kalupur wholesale market, rates have gone up by 20-25%. We are a joint family and, hence, consumption of vegetable is very high. I have, therefore, no option but to go to Kalupur,"" she said."
370,Govt targets middlemen in food chain as inflation bites,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Govt-targets-middlemen-in-food-chain-as-inflation-bites/articleshow/38195864.cms,2014-11-08,The Times Of India,"NEW ELHI: Every few weeks farmer Jay Narayan Singh hauls onions and potatoes in a hired lorry to a wholesale market an hour's drive from his home in the country's northern plains, only to sell his vegetables at a quarter of the prices retail consumers pay.A law that dates back more than 50 years forces Singh and millions of other farmers to sell produce in regulated markets where middlemen take a hefty cut, boosting the cost of fruit and vegetables sold from handcarts and corner shops.""The market is nothing but a haven for a clique of middlemen who indulge in profiteering, depriving both farmers and consumers of a fair price,"" Singh said.As food inflation nears 10 per cent, the new government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces accusations that it is doing no better at reining in prices than the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty's Congress party, which suffered its worst election defeat in May.Determined to avoid a repeat of the inflation scourge that contributed to the Congress downfall, Modi is taking aim at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act.The law aims to protect farmers from exploitation by rich landlords, and requires all produce to be sold through regulated markets in most of the 29 states.Even big retailers, such as Reliance Industries, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Shoppers' Stop and Britain's Tesco Plc, can only buy through wholesale markets governed by the Act.But critics say too many people in the supply chain seek a cut, which exaggerates price rises during India's frequent supply disruptions because of a perennial shortage of storage.Modi's food and finance ministers are now pushing states to let fruit and vegetable farmers sell to anyone they want, ending a practice that governs more than 7,000 wholesale markets.""Allowing direct purchases will be a win-win proposition,"" said farmer Ved Prakash Sharma, as he oversaw labourers unloading sacks of vegetables at the Hapur wholesale market, about 60 km from the Indian capital, New Delhi.""While we will get a fair price for our goods, consumers will have to pay less.""Authorities in the capital have already taken the step, but other state governments face a tough battle against entrenched vested interests in doing the same. Only Bihar has so far succeeded in revoking the Act.Many middlemen who benefit from the system are supporters of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which needs to keep voters sweet ahead of assembly polls due this year in Delhi, Haryana and Maharashtra.Even some farmers could baulk at any assault on traders, who are often a source of credit in hard times after drought or crop failure.An opaque system of auction by traders' cartels leaves farmers with scant bargaining power.Farmers who travel long distances to market often cannot afford to return home without a sale, said Naveen Yadav, a farmer who brought a truckload of okra to Hapur.""After extensive research we found that the total margin of middlemen in the entire chain adds up to 75 per cent, ramping up costs for consumers,"" said Gokul Patnaik, chairman of GlobalAgri System, a Delhi-based farm consultancy.In other countries where the food supply chain is better integrated, the margin ranges from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, he added.Excluding fruit and vegetables from the APMC Act would cut prices by at least 5 per cent because direct selling would cut out middlemen's commissions and wholesale market fees, he said.Numerous middlemen also add to a high rate of spoilage, as cargoes get repeatedly loaded and unloaded.That leads to wastage of as much as a quarter of the value of goods, with consumers paying the cost, Patnaik said.Levies such as wholesale market fees, purchase and sales taxes, and weighing and loading charges also boost final prices.Some states add a tax to fund welfare programmes, such as Punjab, where levies add up to nearly 15 per cent of the value of goods.Food minister Ram Vilas Paswan favours a uniform market in which farmers can sell whatever, and wherever, they want.""There's no market for India as a nation,"" Paswan told reporters last month. ""Everywhere you have sort of a barricade. We are trying to bring in the concept of India as one market.""But Paswan could face resistance from state governments, which could fight measures that threaten earnings from taxes.Farming forms 14 per cent of India's nearly $2-trillion economy and employs more than half its 1.2-billion population.Stamping out middlemen is not a panacea.The government will have to give private players incentives to invest in alternative large markets, said Ashok Gulati, an agriculture expert at economic policy think-tank ICRIER.Middlemen still thrive in Bihar, the only state to have junked the Act, because it offered no alternative arrangement to growers, such as private markets or direct purchase centres.Trying to modernise the food supply chain by meddling with every stage and every product would only lead to failure, a group of senior government officials warned recently.""One way of playing an enabling role is to allow foreign direct investment into multi-product retail,"" they said in an internal memo, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.Modi's BJP has ruled out foreign direct investment in supermarkets, however. Losing patience, Wal-Mart has dropped a wholesale joint venture with a local firm and France's Carrefour (CARR.PA) plans to close its four wholesale stores in India.Still, revamping the act would be the best solution, farmer Jay Narayan Singh told Reuters.""As a third-generation farmer, I can tell you the Act has outlived its usefulness and must be either abolished or overhauled to help both farmers and consumers,"" he said."
371,Traders seek price regulation,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1141108/jsp/northeast/story_1124.jsp,2014-11-08,Telegraph,"A man carries a sack of potatoes at a market. Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Nov. 7: The fall in diesel prices has not brought potato and onion prices down prompting trade associations to seek Dispur's intervention in regard to regulation of the rates of the kitchen essentials. The diesel prices in Guwahati were slashed from Rs 61.79 per litre on August 31 to Rs 55.95 on November 1. But the rate cut has not reflected on the commodity prices that continue to be more or less unchanged from what it was two months back. The potato wholesale prices in the city today hovered around the Rs 23 to Rs 24 mark as against the retail rates of Rs 30 to Rs 32. The wholesale prices of onion stood at Rs 26/Rs 27 as against the retail rates of Rs 32/Rs 35. Trade associations here cite the absence of a mechanism to regulate commodity rates and high freight rates as reasons for the trend. ""The state government has to step in here. A mechanism has to be created wherein the prices of the items are regulated and monitored at regular intervals so that the burden is not passed on to the consumers,"" Rupam Goswami, the chairman of the Assam Chamber of Commerce, told The Telegraph here today. A major chunk of the commodities are routed through rail, while the rest are transported to the state by trucks. The potatoes generally come from Bengal and Uttar Pradesh while the onions come from Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Bangalore. ""The prices have not changed as the rail and truck freight rates have not come down after the fuel cut. Here, if the price of fuel goes up by Re 1, the transporter hikes the rate by Rs 50 per quintal. On the contrary, the fare does not come down when there is a cut in fuel prices,"" alleges Binod Surana, the secretary of the Guwahati Potato Onion Merchants' Association. The transporters, on the contrary, said their profit margins were affected by the presence of middlemen and absence of a uniform freight rate. ""There are a number of brokers in our area who fix rates to suit their interests. We do not have any say in the absence of a union. Then again, most of the goods trucks we send to Agartala and Silchar come back empty, which eats into our profit margins. The maintenance of the 12-wheel trucks does take a toll on our budget,"" said Ajit Singh, a transporter at Beltola. The Kamrup (metro) district administration in a bid to regulate the rates had in September laid down strict guidelines for potato and onion traders. The wholesalers and sub-wholesalers were directed to display in their shops the price and stock of the commodities in local language and issue cash memos. ""Not all retailers have price/stock display boards in their stalls now. I was amazed to find three varieties of potatoes being sold at Rs 35, Rs 40 and Rs 50 per kg at the Bhangagarh market today. At Uzan Bazar though, I was told that it was sold for Rs 30 and Rs 32. So, where is the regulation?"" asked Sumi Gogoi, a homemaker."

The rains have affected the supply. While at least 15 vehicles used to bring vegetables every day, there were less than 10 vehicles this morning, said S. Amaravathy, a vendor at the Mattuthavani market on Friday. Brinjal was being sold at Rs.40 a kilogram, beans at Rs.50, cucumber at Rs.35 and potato at Rs.30. The prices were lower before the rains, said vendors. Tomato was the only vegetable that was priced less  Rs.10 to Rs.15 a kg. It will take another 15 days for heavy arrivals into the market. We are expecting the prices to remain stable till Pongal in mid-January, said S. Kannan, another vegetable vendor.The prices might also come down a little when the market gets flooded with mochai beans in a few weeks, since they are inexpensive and preferred over other vegetables by many customers, he added.At the Bibikulam Uzhavar Santhai also prices of potato and brinjal had shot up to Rs.40 per kilo and Rs.55 per kilo respectively. Beans were sold at Rs.55 and ladies finger at Rs.35. Green peas was the most expensive  Rs.100 to Rs.130 per kilo.The demand for vegetables has hit the roof in the last one week and will continue to increase due to the marriage season that starts in the next three weeks, said K. Arumugam, Agriculture Officer at Bibikulam market."

Retail vendors at the Gandhi Market have been vying with each other to sell off their produce. The price of tomato which was sold at Rs.20-25 a kg a month ago has now come down to Rs.15, mainly due to increase in yield. Similar is the price of carrot (from Rs.40 to Rs.20); cabbage (from Rs.20 to Rs.15); and lemon (from Rs.10 to Rs.1.50 per fruit). The prices of a few vegetables have remained stable as in the case of potato (Rs.30 a kg) and brinjal (Rs.40 to Rs.50).A cross section of retail vendors point out that a sharp increase in the arrivals of carrot and cabbage from Bangalore, Kodaikanal, and Udhagamandalam has resulted in the fall in the prices of these vegetables.Cluster beans prices upCluster beans is the only vegetable which has registered a hike in the price. P.Krishnan, a farmer of Punganur, who markets his cluster beans at the Gandhi Market, said the rain has done more harm than good to his crop. As his 40-day crop, raised on an acre during purattasi pattam was nearing harvest this month, the moderate showers for a few consecutive days last month had caused a fall in yield. Against his average daily harvest of 50 kg, he could harvest just 30 kg. Further, the crop was also discoloured. The wholesale price of cluster beans has now shot up to Rs.14 a kg from its price of Rs.8 a fortnight ago."

Over the last month, prices of these two vegetables have risen by nearly 20% in wholesale markets and over 40-45% in retail.However, according to market sources, prices are likely to shoot up further by mid-August. On Tuesday, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, told the state assembly that onion and potatoes needed to be included as essential commodities listed under the Gujarat Essential Commodities Rules 1977.On July 2, the Union government put these two vegetables under stockholding limits through the Essential Commodities Act. Orissa and Rajasthan have already put these vegetables under the ambit of the Act.In his announcement, Chudasama said that henceforth each trader dealing in these vegetables will have to maintain a stock register with details of purchase and sale. He told the house that the government was also planning to put a ceiling on the stock a trader can store. While speaking to reporters, he the minister said that a trader would be allowed to stock up to 100 tons of each.Currently, stock limit provisions exist for various foodgrains and cereals under the Essential Commodities Act. By the provisions of the Act, hoarders and black marketers are liable for criminal prosecution and hoarded materials can be confiscated and sold. Officials said that after the Centre brought these under the Act, it was necessary to include them in the state list, and only then can the state move to impose stockholding limits."

The market prices of these products had fallen steeply, making the farmers a worried lot, he said at a press conference here on Friday.Last year, the price of maize was Rs. 1,600 a quintal. This year, its price was ruling at less than Rs. 1,000 a quintal.The price of millets had come down to Rs. 1,600 to Rs. 1,800 a quintal against Rs. 2,300 a quintal last year. The price of ginger had also fallen.The government should take measures to boost the morale of farmers by announcing reasonable support prices for these products. Now, copra prices have gone up because the government declared support price for it. A similar measure is required in the case of other crops as well, he said.He said, even potato growers had suffered huge losses as the fungal infection had adversely affected the yield this year too. All potato growers have sold their produces by now. The government should announce a compensation package for them as they have suffered losses, he said.He said that Horticulture Minister Shamanur Shivashankarappa had promised to send a team of experts to know the plight of potato growers in the district, in response to his (Mr. Shivarams) question in the Legislative Council. However, no committee has visited the district so far, he alleged."

Make your way to the closest prominent masjid and you will find dozens of eateries selling kebabs, bhajias and sweetmeats. The best way to eat them, the stall owners will tell you, is hot.A true foodie has plenty to choose from the commuter's favourite chicken roll, which costs as little as Rs 30 at some stalls, to a proper meal involving curries and naan.A regular stall has an array of rolls, baida rotis, kebabs, cutlets and lollipops. There are also exotic offerings such as the special sheermal naan and lamba pav.Vegetarians have no reason to stay away with spicy red aloo chaat, turmeric coloured-ragda, bhajias made of spinach, onion and potato that literally drip with oil, also on each stall. Not to miss are the colourful faloodas, which work perfectly after a greasy and spicy meal.Ahmed Fayaz sets up his stall outside Noor Masjid in Vashi and he will tell you that the best time to get to the food is when it has just been laid out. ""The stalls open when the fast ends. It is not just members of the Muslim community who visit but patrons from Navi Mumbai and Thane, too, come here for a quick bite,"" he said.Then, there is 40-something Ansari who has been running a stall for well over a decade now.""The number of people who visit my stall have increased. Usually, people going home from work take a detour to my stall. Some even carry empty lunch boxes to take food home,"" he said. He usually sells out all his wares within an hour of setting up shop. Ansari, Fayaz and several others, however, deviate from the normal plate size when selling their treats.""The style of charging changes during Ramzan. We charge per piece not per plate. It helps those who eat smaller portions and food isn't wasted,"" said Shohaib Malik, a restaurant owner near APMC market. Residents, however, during this period don't bother with the prices. ""The food is spicy but it complements the weather. I give up the spoons and forks, these kebabs are best eaten with our fingers. My wife and I go to these stalls regularly during Ramzan,"" said Shailesh Jadhav from Vashi."

The losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damages and other preventable risks would be excluded under the scheme.The scheme is compulsory to farmers availing seasonal agriculture operation (SAO) loans from the financial institutions, including commercial banks, cooperative banks, regional banks and primary agriculture cooperatives (PACs) for the insured crops within the stipulated period; while its optional for non-loanee farmers.The level of indemnity for wheat and barley crops is kept at 80% of the average yield (threshold yield). In case of loanee farmers, sum insured would be at least equal to amount of loan advanced.For the loanee farmers, in such cases, where amount of crop loan availed comes out to be more than either the value of threshold yield or 150 % of average yield, normal premium rates (lower of flat rate or actuarial rate) will be applicable on the full amount of the loan availed, as the full amount of loan is to be compulsorily insured.The small and marginal farmers are eligible for 50 % government subsidy on total premium as per the decision taken by the state to enhance the subsidy on premium on the insurable crops, including maize, paddy and potato and for ginger under crop insurance scheme from 10% to 50% (45% as state share and 5% as centre share)."

The family of six, which lives on meagre daily wages, is finding it hard to afford pulses anymore.We were farmers back in our village. We came down to the city in search of a job after successive years of drought. Now we ourselves cannot afford food, the farmer from Yadgir lamented.The price of toor dal, an integral part of meals, has shot up by more than Rs. 40 in the past two weeks alone. Toor dal now sells at Rs. 95 to Rs. 110 a kg in the retail market. This steep hike is attributed to crop failure due to lack of rainfall in Kalaburagi, the major source of pulses in the State. An official from the Agriculture Department said a recent survey in that district revealed that 63,000 hectares of land with pulses had been affected by scanty rainfall and the flowers were withering. It is feared that 50,000 more hectares of crop would be severely affected if rains are delayed by another week, raising fears of another steep increase in toor dal prices.The prices of urad dal and moong dal have also skyrocketed to more than Rs. 100 in the last month alone. Urad dal is being sold at Rs. 103 to Rs. 105 a kg and moong dal at Rs. 115 to Rs. 125 in the city.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, told The Hindu that two consecutive crop failures of urad and moong dal in Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh were the reasons for the unprecedented hike. He said the next crop was expected by February and hoped that there would be a good yield, which would stabilise prices in the market.Vegetable pricesVegetable prices have also seen an increase over the last two weeks. A kilogram of potatoes is being sold at Rs. 42 at Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) outlets in the city and at Rs. 50 in retail shops. A week ago it was Rs. 30. A kilogram of beans is being sold at Rs. 57, an increase of Rs. 20 in just a week.A HOPCOMS official said that the supply of greens had taken a hit over the past few weeks, initially due to heavy rain in areas and later for lack of sufficient rain. A kilogram of coriander leaves in HOPCOMS has almost doubled to Rs. 196."

(Source: Express photo)Chief Minister Anandiben Patel on Sunday inaugurated the new complex of Rajkot Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) in Bedi village on the outskirts of the city and called on farmers to use technology to enter global market for realising best price of their produce.The new yard complex is spread over an area of 37.36 hectares and the CM said it was one of the largest APMCs in the country. The new complex has more than 600 shops and godowns besides auction area and relevant buildings. The Rajkot AMPC has spent Rs 272 crore for developing the complex. I believe, this is the largest AMPC in the country. Even if this is not, make this the best in the country by adopting technology in trading and farming, the CM said after inaugurating the yard.The CM referred to Surat APMC which has started online booking facility and doorstep delivery system for vegetable and fruits in that city.Not only this, think of giving irradiation treatment to your produce like potato to store them for long time and send them to international markets to realise better prices. A model irradiation centre has been set up in Bavla near Ahmedabad and I suggest the directors of Rajkot APMC to visit that centre, Patel said.The CM added that Central government was giving 50 per cent grant for setting up such a facility. She further added that irradiated vegetable and fruit could be stored at around 15 degree Celsius temperature and thereby could cut electricity bills of cold storages by 15 per cent.Rajkot AMPC chairman Hardevsinh Jadeja said the old complex located on National Highway 27 near the city will now be used as vegetable and fruit market as well as building storage facilities while new complex will deal with other agricultural commodities.Rajkot APMC, which is named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Marketing Yard, was established in 1964 and the body is celebrating its golden jubilee year.

Now, there is no good news from the vegetable markets as well.After staying low for sometime, prices of several vegetables have shot up in the last 10 days in Vellore district. Traders attribute the increase in rates to reduced supply following crop damage in the rains at the supply areas.Majority of vegetables for Vellore district comes from parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Rains in these areas have damaged crops, hence leading to loss in yield, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.Under these circumstances, suppliers are unable to bring vegetables from the neighbouring States as the produce perished quickly unable to withstand the distance, he said, adding, Hence, many were selling the produce in the local areas itself without supplying outside. The supply has reduced, and the prices have shot up.Though tomatoes and onions remain stable, carrots, beans, broad beans (avarakkai), ladys finger and brinjal have turned costlier. The prices of these vegetables have steadily increased by at least Rs. 15 to 20 in the last 10 days, Mr. Balu noted.Buying a bunch of coriander could burn a hole in the purse for consumers. Coriander is supplied from areas within Vellore district and Karnataka. But again, there was damage to the plants in the rains. As a result, the rate has skyrocketed, with a bunch costing Rs. 60 to Rs. 70, he said.Tomato costs Rs. 10 to Rs. 15, while onions are priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 per kilo. Carrots are priced at Rs. 50 to 60 a kilo, when compared to Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 almost 10 days ago. A kilo of beans costs Rs. 80, while broad beans costs Rs. 60 and ladys finger cost Rs. 25 to Rs. 30. Brinjal is priced at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80.The cost of other vegetables (per kilo) are  small onions  Rs. 35, potato  Rs. 30  35, cabbage  Rs. 15, cauliflower  Rs. 20 to 25 (medium size) and Rs. 40 (big size), ginger  Rs. 35 to 50 and green chillies  Rs. 20 to 25."

The common man that voted Raje-led BJP government with thumping majority is hoping major relief on things that impact their daily life.Some feel that since onions and potatoes have hogged the limelight for sharp rise in prices, the overall household budget has been shooting up to unsustainable levels.""I hope there will be some major announcements on the inflation front. Vegetables are not the only things that have hurt household budgets but pulses and cereals have also become dearer in past few months,"" said Manisha Arora, a government teacher.Meanwhile, industrialists feel that the government will fulfill its promise to boost investor environment in the state.""There have been some progress on easing the process to start business. Amendments in labour laws is one step in that direction. But we still have to go miles to make Rajasthan an industrial hub. Single window clearance should be made more effective while environmental clearances for non-polluting units should be removed,"" said Tarachand Chaudhary, president, Vishwakarma indsutrial area. There is also a demand to expedite the refinery project. The state government has so far moved slowly in this regard.""Refinery is a big ticket project. It alone can create a big industrial revolution and leads to major investment,"" said Kanti Kishore, CMD of a chemicals factory in Jodhpur. Apart from it, the government is also expected to make some decisive moves in the mining sector.Lease holders who are reeling under environment clearances may get respite from the budget. Though government will have to make a fine balance between ecology and growth in this sector.In the health sector, the state government is likely to push for filling up of vacant posts of doctors. Rajasthan has the highest deficit of medical personnel in the country. Seven new more medical colleges are to be opened in the state which may face faculty shortages."

In May, prices rose 6.01 per cent from a year earlier.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, elected in May amid anger over persistently high inflation, particularly food inflation, has ordered a crackdown on hoarding to hold down food prices and set limits on the export of staples, such as onions and potatoes.While those measures helped cool food inflation to 8.14 per cent in June from 9.50 per cent the previous month, vegetable prices still recorded a double-digit gain during the month.Adding to inflationary worries are prospects of a first drought in five years and turmoil in Iraq, which have increased the risk of a run-up in food and fuel prices.Weak rainfall in India since the monsoon season started last month has already driven up prices of basic food items, such as milk, potatoes and tomatoes and could further delay a decision by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates and ease the flow of credit to the economy.""We continue to remain cautious on the (inflation) trajectory given the scanty rainfalls witnessed across different parts of the country,"" said Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist at ING Vysya Bank in Mumbai.""At the same time, pick-up in demand is further likely to keep the core prices under pressure leaving no room for RBI to ease monetary policy at least through this year.""RBI governor Raghuram Rajan held benchmark interest rates at 8 per cent at the June policy meeting. He has raised rates three times since taking charge last September. The next policy review is due on Aug. 5.Last week, Rajan said the central bank was ""determined"" to make sure consumer inflation, which it tracks to set lending rates, follows a ""glide path"" lower.Economists in a Reuters poll forecast that consumer price inflation probably eased to 7.95 per cent last month, down from 8.28 per cent in May. The government will release the consumer price data at 1200 GMT.A flare-up in global crude prices also runs the risk of aggravating India's inflationary woes as the country imports nearly 80 per cent of its oil.Brent crude bounced off of three-month lows on Monday to stand above $106 a barrel on fears of supply disruptions amid new and continuing violence in Libya and Iraq."

Within one month, the prices of the vegetables have risen by up to 30% in both wholesale and retail.

Now, huge quantities of tomatoes were rotten and the price is almost 50% higher as compared to the month of June.The wholesale price of every vegetable at the Mohana Mandi in the city has also increased. Attributing the increase in prices to the delayed monsoon and the scorching heat, traders said the prices will continue to take an upward swing till August.""The local harvest of tomato available till the month of June was sold at Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg in the wholesale and Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg in the retail.

384,10 strategies for combating inflation,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/personal-finance/10-strategies-for-combating-inflation/articleshow/38347972.cms,2014-11-11,The Times Of India,"Inflation is once again on the boil. Here are a few strategies that can help you fight the incessant march of prices.Just when consumers and investors were getting ready to welcome the acche din promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the inflation ogre has come back from the cold.The whole price index rose 6.01% in May, a sharp rise from 5.2% in the previous month. Although consumer price inflation was lower in May due to subdued food prices, analysts fear that it is only a mater of time before the recent railway fare hike pushes it up again. When freight tariff goes up, it has a cascading effect on prices of almost all products and commodities.According to a Nomura estimate, inflation could rise by 10-15 basis points due to the railway fare hike. Plus, the prospects of a weak monsoon and failed crops threaten to push up vegetable prices. Then there is Iraq on the boil, which has put global oil prices on fire. And curbs on sugar imports have pushed up domestic prices of the sweetener.What does all this mean for the common man? For one, your food bill is going to be quite fat in the coming months. While there is little you can do to control inflation or change the course of the monsoon, you can reduce the stress on your finances by spending smartly, consuming efficiently and investing intelligently. ET Wealth suggests 10 strategies that can help consumers and investors stay ahead of the incessant march of prices. A small caveat: these are not silver bullets that can kill the inflation monster. Some of these may not even work for you. But if you adopt even 4-5 of these ideas, you would be able to cushion yourself from inflation to a certain extent.Check your inventory and draw up a shopping list before you go to the market. Make a list of items you need and stick to the plan. Making purchasing decisions on the spur of the moment, swayed by combo deals or lured by the siren song of attractive displays, makes you more susceptible to buying items you don't really need. The rule of thumb is to never go grocery shopping on an empty stomach because food looks a lot more appealing when the belly is growling. You are more likely to be tempted to buy an extra pack of muffins or a large pack of chips, sending your budget haywire. Eat well before you head for the supermarket. Also, if you are a compulsive shopper, take hard cash instead of your credit card. While plastic has made spending easier, tracking how much you really spend has become difficult. Research shows that cash payments pinch more, forcing you to be circumspect when it comes to spending.The thousands of crores of rupees that FMCG companies spend on advertising their wares are recovered from consumers through higher product prices. You can avoid paying high prices by opting for the home brands of large retail chains or the unbranded merchandise at your local kirana shop. This may not apply to personal care products like soaps and toothpastes or certain foodstuffs but you can safely go for unbranded items of homecare products like floor cleaners and detergents. Also avoid paying more for packaged spices and condiments. If you buy loose, you can get the same stuff at a much lower price.Remember, the fancy packaging and advertising costs are built into the price of branded items.Just keep a strict control on the quality when you buy loose.Sale is a small word that can be a big opportunity for the careful spender. Many hypermarkets offer heavy discounts on different items almost throughout the year. While you cannot buy too much of foodstuff, you can stock up on nonperishables when there is a sale. Paper towels, soaps, detergents and many such items can be easily stored for months. Similarly, your clothing bill can be cut by 25-30% if you buy during offseason sales. But there is also a downside. You get to wear the clothes only next year. Do the math when you go shopping. A 20% discount on a single shirt may be a better deal than a buy-2 get-1-free offer that makes you purchase more than you need. Besides, the lowest value item is free in the deal.Any product willobviously be cheap er in the wholesalemarket. At '32-33 akg, the wholesaleprice of sugar is al most 20% lowerthan the retail priceof '38-40 a kg. Theonly glitch: you willhave to purchase alarger quantity when you go to the wholesale market. The problem is that you have to buy a 50 kg sack of sugar in wholesale. You can get around this problem by forming mini-cooperatives with 3-4 friends or neighbours who may want to share the effort as also the gains. One of them can drive to the mandi every week by rotation.Food items are cheaper if you purchase in bulk from a wholesale market. But not all vegetables are fit for bulk deals. Some vegetables are very perishable so you might end up wasting money instead of saving it. Potatoes and onions are perfect candidates for bulk purchases because you can store them for days, even weeks. Other vegetables, such as bitter gourds, carrots, cucumber, tomatoes and radishes cannot be stored for more than 4-5 days. Leafy vegetables, such as spinach and fenugreek, will turn squishy after a day or two. These are best bought just when you need them in small quantities. No doubt this will be costlier than the bulk rate, but you also avoid wastage.According to one estimate, the average urban household in India wastes about 15-20% of the food it buys. Imagine what this means in rupee terms. Assuming that the average urban, middle-class household spends '15,000 a month on food, nearly '2,250-3,000 worth of food is thrown into the waste bin every month. The opportunity cost can be mind-boggling. While you cannot avoid wastage completely, you can curtail the waste by careful consumption.Is the cost of fuel pinching you? Try forming a car pool to share the costs with other people headed in the same direction. Yes, this requires some logistics but the arrangement can be very rewarding for the car-pool members. If your current fuel bill is '4,000 a month, sharing with 2-3 others will bring it down to roughly '1,8002,000. A big benefit is that you can check your e-mails and catch up on news during the commute on the days you are not driving. In extreme situations, one might even take a short nap during the journey. Some companies actively encourage employees to join car pools by creating forums. There are also websites that help you find people in your area who can be tapped for joining the pool. Car pooling also helps you save on parking charges and toll fee. As a fringe benefit, you also do your bit for the conservation of the environment.This might seem like a no-brainer but taking lunch to office can help you save a lot.Given the way prices are moving, an average lunch costs about '150 per head. It's a little lower if you settle for fast food. ET Wealth estimates that taking lunch to office can save roughly '2,8003,000 a month. Imagine how much you stand to gain if that money flowed into a recurring deposit or an equity fund every month. You also save time because you need not step out of office.The other advantage is that you get to eat wholesome home-made food instead of the unhealthy stuff served at fast-food joints and eateries.Even if it is lying in your bank savings bank account, your money is not safe. Inflation nibbles into its value every day, eroding its purchasing power. Here is a perspective of what 10% inflation can do to your savings.If you have '50,000 in your bank account, it will grow to about '52,000 in one year. But one year from now prices will be higher and '52,000 will buy only goods worth '47,270 today. So, don't let your money idle in a savings bank account.Never mind the attractive 6-7% being offered on the balance by some banks. Your money must grow faster than that to retain its purchasing power. Opt for a sweep-in bank account. These accounts combine the high returns of a fixed deposit with the liquidity of a savings bank account. You can also put your money in a shortterm debt fund for higher returns.It is often said that a diversified portfolio is a good hedge against volatility. But it can also be your shield against inflation. Do not shy away from volatile assets, such as stocks, if you want to stay ahead of consumer prices. You should have 10-15% in equities. A 100% debt portfolio will always lag behind the inflation rate. This is also why monthly income plans from mutual funds have 10-20% of their corpus in stocks.Besides equities, gold is also seen as a hedge against inflation. But don't allocate more than 10% of your portfolio to it. Experts say gold is no longer the safe haven it has always been.Curiously, investors also stand to gain from high inflation because it helps reduce their tax on capital gains. Tax rules allow investors to adjust the cost of an asset to the inflation during the holding period. The cost inflation number for 2013-14 is 939, and could be roughly 10% higher at 1,032 for this year. This means if you choose the indexation option, you won't have to pay any tax even if your investment earned 10% annualised returns in the past five years. What's more, you can book a notional loss if the investment lagged inflation during the period and adjust it against gains from other investments. If it can't be adjusted in the current year, this loss can be car ried forward for up to eight financial years. However, only certain investments (debt funds, FMPs, gold funds and debt-oriented hybrid schemes) are eligible for indexation benefit."

It isn't difficult to find food stalls. Make your way to the closest prominent masjid and outside you will find dozens of eateries selling kebabs, bhajias and sweetmeats. The best way to eat them, the stall owners will tell you, is hot.""One of my relatives puts up a stall every year, which draws good crowd. He serves spicy items that are sumptuous and in demand across the Muslim community that visits Kalwa dargah,"" said Asraf Khan, a resident of Kalwa.A regular stall has an array of rolls, baida rotis, kebabs, cutlets and lollipops. There are also exotic offerings such as the special sheermal naan and lamba pav. Vegetarians have no reason to stay away with spicy red aloo chaat, turmeric coloured-ragda, bhajias made of spinach, onion and potato that literally drip with oil. Not to miss are the colourful faloodas, which work perfectly after the greasy and spicy meal.Raja Shaikh, owner of a food stall at Rabodi masjid, says, ""This is that time of the year when we make some extra money. It's an anticipated event in the Muslim calendar. We offer a wide range of delicious food at affordable prices for which we are famous among the locals.""Another stall owner said many people going home from work take a detour to his stall.

386,"Rural poor stop buying onions, rates ease",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Rural-poor-stop-buying-onions-rates-ease/articleshow/38390540.cms,2014-11-12,The Times Of India,"NAGPUR: Onion prices have eased by a couple of rupees in the bulk market here, but it is not because of improving supplies, say a section of traders. Rather, the drought is giving fewer work opportunities for the poor rural labourers, forcing them to cut down on this expensive vegetable, which otherwise completes their frugal meal. This has led to a major slump in offtake from traders in interiors of the region, adding to the surplus stock with wholesalers at Nagpur.As against Rs 22 to 24 a kg last week at the Kalamna Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) year, rates touched Rs 20 to 21 for red onions on Monday. The white variety is down to Rs 18 to 20, say wholesalers.The supply remains in the range of 12 to 15 trucks, however, there is hardly any demand, which has brought down the prices. There are chances that lower rates may be eventually passed on to the retail market, where onions continue to be sold in the range of Rs 30 to 35 a kg. However, traders are sceptical of the trend continuing for long.Jaiprakash Wasani, president of Kanda-Batata Market Adatiya Association, said Kalamna market depends substantially on traders from district and taluka places, who further sell onions and potatoes in the interiors. However, the dry spell has hampered farming operations, and the rural poor who earn a living by working as farm hands have been rendered jobless. ""Depending on daily wages, they have been forced to cut down expenses on food,"" said Wasani.At Chandrapur, where onions are cheaper than Nagpur at Rs 15 to 20 a kg, dealer Pramod Wankhede said demand from villages has come down drastically. Almost 30 to 40% of the supplies to the villages are routed from district centres, he said.Santosh Bhutke, a trader at Mul tehsil in Chandrapur said, ""The paddy growing operations have not begun yet. This has left farm labourers unemployed, and they make a major section of the consumers here."" The sale of other vegetables too has taken a hit, with the weekly markets running at almost quarter of their capacity, said Bhutke. Narendra Bhagat, a trader at Wardha, reported a similar situation in the district.However, some dealers at Kalamna also cite other reasons for the rates easing. Ilahi Baksh of M/s Saurashtra Trading said some traders have also begun releasing stocks they had been holding on to. There are chances of stocks getting damaged if kept for long. Others like Wasani say farmers were hoarding stocks, not traders.Vijay Jawandiya said farm labourers are going through dire straits and there are not enough jobs under MNREGA. A source in the divisional commissioner's office said there has been an increase in MNREGA jobs this month. As against 65 lakh mandays allotted for July so far, over 90 lakh mandays have been consumed in Nagpur division. In June, 56 lakh mandays were consumed as against 72 lakh allotted.""There has been a rise indeed, but a part of it can be due to the unutilized quota of last month. In case of need, government has enough funds and the quota can be increased,"" said the official."
387,"Inflation eases, poor rains remain a worry",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Inflation-eases-poor-rains-remain-a-worry/articleshow/38399524.cms,2014-11-12,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Inflation slowed to its lowest level in several months and came near the Reserve Bank of India's comfort zone but the risk of deficient rains may prompt the central bank to hold interest rates at current levels as economists warned of price pressure due scanty monsoon.Data released by the government showed that retail inflation in June hit 7.31%, the lowest level seen since the new measures was introduced in January 2012, while the wholesale price-based index (WPI) was at four-month low of 5.43%, mainly due to because of easing prices of vegetables.RBI had in the past put its comfort zone for WPI-based inflation at 4.5-5%, but has now given it up for Consumer Price Index (CPI), which it believes is a better measure. The central bank had said that it is targeting 8% retail inflation by next January.Although RBI had earlier indicated that it may consider cutting rates if the government came out with a credible fiscal consolidation plan and inflation cooled down, the chances now appear dim in the immediate future. The central bank will also take a note of better industrial growth figure of last week.Just when there appeared to be some comfort, the deficient rains may play spoilsport. ""The positive base effect was blunted by the sharp rise in vegetable prices. Going forward, while the monsoons are a risk, we expect CPI to trend to sub-7% levels and WPI towards sub-5% levels in the coming months. We maintain our view that the space for policy easing is likely to open up in early 2015,"" Citi India economist Rohini Malkani said in a report.The government is on high alert for several food products  ranging from potatoes and onions to rice and milk  to ensure that prices remain under check as weak rains may affect production and result in a spike. Having fought the last election on the price plank the government is keen to avoid high inflation.""We do not expect food inflation to soar considerably due to a) proactive measures already taken by the government b) a strong base effect from last year. In the longer run, announcements in the Budget to boost agriculture and improve the supply chain will help bring down CPI inflation, but lowering and sustaining it around 6%  the Reserve Bank of India's target for January 2016 will pose a challenge,"" ratings agency Crisil said in a note.Apart from weak rains, there is also the fear of a rise in oil prices given the problems in Iraq.When asked to comment on a rate cut, finance minister Arun Jaitley told TOI that rates can be reduced if inflation moderates. ""This comes in the domain of the Reserve Bank of India. But, my own view is that if inflation starts moderating a little, interest rates should be reduced and this will help various sectors. I have just given the example of how we are trying to encourage real estate, if my tax incentives have an impact on real estate and if interest rates come down there will be huge impact,"" he said in an interview."

The reason is said to be scanty supply since last Thursday owing to scarce rain that led to poor harvest.Traders pointed out that among vegetables, tomatoes required maximum water and areas that produced the vegetable had been witnessing a dry spell. ""Due to late monsoon in Narayangaon and its vicinity, where most tomatoes are cultivated, production has dropped substantially as there is not enough water owing to the inordinate delay in rainfall."" said a farmer Manohar Gaikwad. Vendors have now pinned their hope on Bangalore produce.Owing to the drop in supply from Narayangaon to APMC market in Vashi, the wholesale cost jumped to Rs 46 per kg on Tuesday. Looking at the short supply and high demand, retailers enforced new rate structure on Tuesday, pushing the price range from Rs 60 to 80. This change in market trend has affected the end-users. ""Supply has been exhausted due to poor production. The prices started climbing up since Thursday when it was Rs 18 per kg in the wholesale market. On Tuesday, it touched an all-time high with Rs 46,"" said Shankar Pingle, a wholesaler at Vashi.Discontent is brewing among consumers.

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Cuttack, Nov. 12: The overall business by various food stalls set up at the Bali yatra fair ground here has not been encouraging, despite a heavy turnout of visitors in the past three days. A lot of traders engaged in the sale of thunkapuri, a traditional delicacy only available during Bali yatra, are fearing heavy loss due to sharp decline in the sales. Over 15 lakh visitors had thronged the Bali yatra ground in the past three days, while the fair had recorded a highest turnout of eight lakh visitors on Sunday. Over 15 thunkapuri stalls have come up at the yatra, while the traders are charging Rs 70 to 80 per plate, a hike of nearly 5 per cent in the rates compared to the last years rates. However, a trader said the rates had been marginally higher, despite a steep price hike of almost 20 per cent in other commodities. The cost of thunkapuri per plate was around Rs 60 to Rs 70 last year. The traders, engaged in the sale of food items, had also suffered loss due to poor turnout of visitors because of cyclone Phailin and subsequent floods in various parts of the state last year. We have not hiked the prices despite rise in the prices of essential commodities, including potato and onion. So far, we have been able to do a business of Rs 1.5 lakh against Rs 3 lakh last year, said Naru Gopal Das. Das said the cost of potato has reached Rs 25 per kilogram against Rs 13 per kilogram last year. Similarly, the cost of labour has also increased by almost Rs 400 per day as each stall has to engage nearly four workers for preparing the dish. We had not hiked our prices in order to recover the loss sustained last year. But this time, too, we will incur loss due to poor response from the visitors, as we have invested nearly Rs 6 lakh in setting up the stalls and arranging the materials, said Kishore Das, a trader. The traders say the overall response by visitors has not been satisfactory as most of the people are more interested for various fast food items. People have become more health conscious and are avoiding eating outside  which might be the sole reason behind the sharp decline in the sales, said Purshotam Sahoo, a visitor. Sahoo said the sanitation had become the prime focus of people, who wanted better hygiene especially while preparation of the food. However, the traders engaged in the sale of handicrafts and other household articles have managed to do a brisk business at the yatra. The traders from various parts of the state, particularly at the special pavilion set up by the Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society, have recorded a business of over Rs 5 crore. Similarly, the Gandhi Shilpa Bazar has also recorded a business of over Rs 40 lakh in the past four days, while the total business is likely to cross Rs 60 lakh by the end of the fair tomorrow."

Tomatoes have seen the sharpest hike in prices, touching Rs 60/kg in some parts of the city, followed by onions, capsicum and cauliflowers. Potato prices have also surged.The overall rise in vegetable prices has sent households in a tizzy as they struggle to meet their daily expenses.In Kailash Colony, resident Mihir Sharma said: ""When I went to buy vegetables in the morning, I was shocked to hear the prices. Okra and parwal both were Rs 80 per kg. Finally, I ended up buying only half a kg tomato and onion."" He added: ""I live alone and don't really have to spend a lot on vegetables. But I wonder what people who have big families must be going through with even basic food items costing so much.""Patparganj resident Niti Aggarwal was shocked when her local vegetable vendor charged Rs 50 for one kilo tomatoes. ""He told me there was another variety which was cheaper but that pile of tomatoes looked soggy and inedible, so I was forced to shell out what he demanded. Just last week I paid about Rs 30 for the same thing.'' The situation isn't much different in NCR regions of Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurgaon either.""When I visited the Tuesday vegetable market and found out the rates for cauliflowers, I opted not to buy. But with vegetables like onions and tomatoes, you cannot really compromise. It appears that every week the prices of vegetables keeps increasing,'' said Niharika, a resident of sector 100.If you go by the Azadpur subzi mandi officials, the capital is facing a shortage of vegetables like tomato, onion and potato because of the delayed monsoon in northern India and unrelenting heatwave. ""A lot of crops were ruined during heavy rains in February and March this year during excessive rains and we are still facing repercussions because of that. At least 20% crops could not be salvaged and a large percentage of produce was being imported,'' said Raj Kumar Bhatia, general secretary, chamber of Azadpur fruit and vegetable traders association.Tomatoes in particular have taken a hit lately. ""Delhi gets tomato produce from Himachal, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Each state has been badly hit by delayed rainfall and a large percentage of the crops have failed. Because rains have been delayed, the tomatos are still green and have not turned red and ripe enough. In fact, the produce from Karnataka has stopped coming to Delhi because tomatos are a perishable item and could not last a four day truck journey to Delhi. We are getting only a limited supply from Himachal and Maharashtra,'' said Sanjay Chugh, tomatoes traders association, Azadpur mandi. Officials said the wholesale price of tomatoes was about Rs 30-35/kilo.Delhi government, however, vehemently denied there was any shortage in vegetables in Delhi. Senior officials insisted that wholesale traders were just trying to create a panic situation. ""In fact, the current rate of vegetables like tomatos and onions is actually lower than what it was last year in the corresponding period. The average price of tomatoes last year was Rs 42/kg and this time it is Rs 35/kg in retail according to rates we have compiled across the city. Prices of green vegetables fluctuate in rainy season and this is a seasonal issue. There is no shortage in Delhi and no decline in arrival,'' said a senior official from the department of food supplies.Delhi government officials added that they were making vegetables like onions and tomatoes available at subsidized rates across Delhi. ""There is no way to keep check in the retail market but we are trying our best to make people aware of real prices. We send out sixteen lakh SMSes daily and also take regular action against black marketers,'' said an official."

It usually cost one-third this price. What I bought was not good quality and they began yellowing soon,"" said a home maker from Wanowrie.The blame rests squarely on the monsoon's weak pulse and the month-long delay which has begun to affect vegetable cultivation around the city.Vegetable sellers said supply of tomatoes was affected in the last few days because of poor rainfall and the price is expected to remain high for at least another month, till the new crop is harvested.""Supply of tomatoes in the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) has been less than expected since the beginning of the monsoon. It will normalize in the next 15-30 days,"" said an APMC official on Wednesday.Veena Singh, a resident of Aundh annexe, said she was shocked when she went out to buy vegetables for the week. ""It is extremely difficult to do without tomatoes, but they are highly priced. After buying some, I settled for small amounts of beans and okra. A few months ago, onion prices made us weep. Now, it is the turn of tomatoes,"" she said.A vegetable wholesaler in Market Yard blamed the lack of water for irrigation as one of the reasons for shortage of tomatoes. He added that regular watering is vital for a tomato crop and if there is a break in the monsoon, it may affect their quality.Pune gets its supply of tomatoes from Sangli and Satara which have been facing a significant deficiency in rainfall in June and in July, so far.A vegetable retailer from Budhwar Peth said the supply of tomatoes this season has not been good and most batches which are coming are spoiled. Another vegetable seller from Model Colony said the prices of all vegetables have increased recently as the rainfall has been poor.""It takes 20 days for the rainfall to seep into the ground and crops to show signs of revival.

Onion was selling at Rs 45 per kg and tomato Rs 80 per kg. A few weeks ago, he could have bought almost two kgs of onion and three kilos of tomato for that money.Be it carrot, green peas, cabbage, capsicum or potato, vendors were quoting higher prices for almost all vegetables ? in fact almost double of what they charged a week ago.Though vendors across markets in the city attribute the steep hike in prices to the scarcity of rain and crop loss, customers say vegetable sellers are just trying to make a fast buck now. In fact, vegetables like tomato (Rs 56 per kg), onion (Rs 37) and potato (Rs 34) are cheaper at Hopcoms outlets. But the supply is limited. Traders say rising demand from other states, specially neighbouring ones, has caused prices to go up in local markets.Around 300 tonnes of tomatoes are being supplied to Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and New Delhi, leaving barely 50 tonnes for local markets, said R V Gopi, president, Wholesale Vegetable Merchants' Association. ""These states have also received scanty rainfall, resulting in a low yield of vegetables. Traders from neighbouring states directly contact the farmers in Kolar and other districts and place orders. Local farmers are ready to meet their demands as the vegetables fetch good rates,"" he added.Pragati CN, a homemaker, believes that apart from the truant rain, vendors are also to blame. ""They know that people can't do without essential vegetables like onion, green peas and potato. So they are making the most of the situation by hiking the rates,"" she rued.""We used to get 10 truckloads of onions every day. Now, it has come down to five. This being the Ramzan season, there is a massive demand for onions as it is the main ingredient of samosa,"" said Mohammad Ibrahim, a merchant from Russel Market.Onions to bring more tearsIf you thought Rs 45 per kg is bad, there's worse to come. Data available with the horticulture department reveals that onion production has been hit due to insufficient rains in May and June, the sowing season for the crop. Areas like Tarikere in Chikmagalur, Jagalur in Chitradurga, and Gadag and Hubli districts, which are key onion producers, are set to suffer losses. Crop loss in Karnataka means its dependence on Maharashtra, which supplies produce only later in the year. In short, prices are only expected to shoot up."

Two marketing aggregators, on contract basis, have been identified and assigned to procure the vegetables from the farmers.Last September, the peri-metro vegetable cluster programme was launched by the department at Kilkowhatty and Anikorai villages near Ooty. ""The vegetable cluster centre failed to attract buyers. Hence the department proposed to launch one in Ooty with marketing aggregators,"" said N Mani, joint director of horticulture. The two collection centres in the villages were closed, according to the official.The peri-metro vegetable cluster programme facilitates both farmers and vegetable outlet owners to conduct business without middlemen. The collection centre was inaugurated by Nilgiris collector, P Sankar.""The aggregators will procure the vegetables from the farmers group daily. The department will intervene in fixing the price of vegetables based on the market rate,"" said Mani.About 224 farmer groups comprising 4200 farmers from various villages in and around Ooty have registered themselves centre.On the inaugural day, about 2.5 metric tonnes of vegetables were procured by the marketing aggregators at the cost of Rs1.5lakh.

According to him, a sum of Rs.98.62lakh was dispersed to local farmers as subsidy from the department for cultivation of vegetables.The newly launched vegetable cluster centre in Ooty is in addition to the vegetable procurement, already in practice since last year, by the cooperative department at the farmers' field itself. The cooperative department is conducting the procurement of farm-fresh vegetables from the farmers as per the indent received from the ?Farm-Fresh outlets in Chennai. Based on the requirement of the indent by the Chennai outlets, the officials of the cooperative department identify the farms and approach the farmers at their fields for procurement.There are around 20,000 farmers cultivating vegetables such as carrot, beetroot, cabbage, potato and beans in around 7000 hectares of farm land in the Nilgiris, according to Mani. The majority of the farmers hold a minimum land of at least one acre while about 3000 farmers hold more than 5 acres."

In Guwahati, members of AASU conducted a protest rally against black marketers and food and civil supplies officials from AASU's state headquarters, located in Uzanbazar, to the office of the deputy commissioner of Kamrup (Metro).""If the government and administration officials do not take any affective measure to curb the price rise that is pinching the pockets of the commoners, AASU will launch intense agitation against price rise,"" said Razmil Ali, the president of the All Guwahati Students' Union.Holding placards protesting inflation, AASU activists from various schools and colleges in the city participated in the protest rally in large numbers. Commoners affected by the price rise also joined the rally, which ended after a memorandum was submitted to the deputy commissioner.The hike in prices of food items and other essential commodities in the market over the past two weeks, especially in and around the city, agitated and disappointed the people.On Saturday, the food and civil supplies department fixed the retail price of the most commonly used onions from Nasik and Indore at Rs 25 to Rs 28 per kg, but many buyers said the government's price fix did not coincide with the price charged by the vendors. In some markets in the city, onions were still being sold at Rs 30 and beyond.Similarly, although the food and civil supplies department fixed the price of the most commonly bought potatoes at Rs 20 to Rs 24 a kg, many retailers are continuing to charge more than the price fixed by the government.In the last few days, the price of tomatoes, too, has risen to Rs 40 per kg in the city.""Officials should be deputed by the government in the popular city markets to verify the price on the spot when we feel that sellers are charging an exorbitant price on a particular commodity,"" said Mayuri Choudhury, a resident of the Ganeshguri area of Guwahati."

Onion prices have risen by 50 to 70 per cent. There is no fall in production or arrivals in wholesale mandis but the prices are still rising.The new government had announced a slew of measures to tackle price rise, especially for vegetables. To curb hoarding, onions and potatoes were included in a list of essential commodities whose stocks could be limited by state government orders. This happened about a fortnight ago but the states are still stuck in the bureaucratic details.In case of onions, there was considerable sabre-rattling in Delhi with calls for action against onion cartels in Maharashtra. It was hoped that listing onions as 'essential' would help. But the Maharashtra government has not issued any order and so status quo prevails.Freeing farmers to sell their produce anywhere, as opposed to the official mandis governed by law, was another action taken by the government. But that too has failed to bring down prices.Recent announcements that inflation is dipping have done little to mollify the aam aadmi who is wondering why the government data is at variance with ground reality.First, there are two types of inflation data put out  wholesale and retail (known as consumer prices). There is always a significant difference between the two. Retail prices are always higher than wholesale ones.Second, and more importantly, inflation is calculated on a year-on-year basis. For example, average prices of onions in June this year are compared to prices in June last year. In some cases, prices are lower than last year  but that is meaningless to the family which was paying Rs 20 for a kilo of onions a month ago and is now paying Rs 30 or 35.Third, inflation data is usually a month late. The data released on 14 July was for June. This is understandable because data on prices is collected and compiled from all over the country. But for the aam aadmi, the price battle is a daily one, and month-old data gives no succour."
404,Little on farm plate for private players,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1141120/jsp/bengal/story_19063532.jsp,2014-11-20,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Nov. 19: The government is scheduled to introduce a bill in the Assembly tomorrow to allow private players to buy produce directly from farmers through brihat krishak bazaars (large farmers markets), but the proposed legislation lacks clarity on land and the amount that can be procured. The West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2014, which was distributed among MLAs today, makes it clear that the government is keen on involving private players to ensure smoother supply of farm products from the field to the kitchen. The bill is aimed at paving the path for the private sectors participation in the process, said an official, adding that the bill was drawn up keeping the chief ministers suggestions in mind. Although the move to ensure private participation in the trade of agriculture produce is well-intentioned, some officials said it was half-hearted. The Left Front government had failed to open the trade for private investors because of stiff resistance from the Forward Bloc. The government will issue licences to private investors to buy, stock and sell agricultural produce directly. The licence will be issued against the payment of fees. The amount will be fixed later. This will help the state generate some additional revenue, an official said. But the question is whether the private players will be excited about the plan, he added. According to a businessman who markets agricultural produce, interested players would prefer clarity on whether they can get land for setting up the markets and the storage facilities. Officials said the question was valid. Although the government will set up the infrastructure for krishak bazaars in the blocks and involve investors, who will build the brihat krishak bazaars at the district level, land issues should have been sorted out in the bill, they said. Moreover, key questions on how much the private players can procure, store and sell are not mentioned. Given the way the government suddenly intervened in the potato market by pegging its price and stopping its export to other states, there is always an uncertainty over whether it can impose similar restrictions on other farm items. Who wants to take the risk? the businessman said. A section of officials said attempts would be made to clarify these issues as the chief minister was keen to ensure that both farmers and retail buyers got the fair price. Senior officials said that soon after coming to power, Mamata Banerjee had taken steps to develop a direct supply chain of agriculture produce from the farm to the market to help farmers realise a better price. Initially, it had been decided that the government would set up krishak bazaars in each of the 341 blocks. Farmers would sell their produce directly to the buyers, thus nullifying intermediaries who normally source the products from the villages. As part of the plan, three krishak bazaars, one each in Hooghly, West Midnapore and Burdwan, were inaugurated but the response was not good as the farmers did not show interest because of lack of buyers. It was felt that the supply chain couldnt be run with the help of government-backed krishak bazaars alone, an official said. This prompted the government to tweak the plan and allow private players to build brihat krishak bazaars, one in each district, and in turn run the krishak bazaars at the block level to source agricultural produce. A similar effort to invite investors to build brihat krishak bazaars early this year failed because of lukewarm response from private players. Advertisements were put, seeking expression of interest to build brihat krishak bazaars in seven districts. But nobody applied. The investors did not show interest as the government had asked them to arrange for land for the project. With the amended bill, the government is making another attempt to attract private players, an official said."

Rajesh, MP, said the project has left him in a difficult position, having already adopted a panchayat in Attappady.No separate funds have been allocated and we have been asked to use the funds of the MP Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS). In that case, the entire MPLADS funds, over which the whole constituency has rightful claim, would have to be spent on a single panchayat and even that would be insufficient, Mr. Rajesh told The Hindu .He was also critical of a meeting of District Collectors and MPs held last week to discuss the project, which, he alleged, was addressed by an external consultant instead of senior officials of the Union Ministry for Rural Development, as informed.P. Rajiv, MP, who adopted Udayamperoor in Ernakulam on Monday, called for flexibility in the guidelines for the project to benefit the State. The focus areas of the project such as human development index had been drafted keeping in mind north Indian villages, leaving the fairly developed villages in the State outside the ambit of the project.The government should issue instructions whereby funds under various other Central projects such as the PMGSY (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana) could also be utilised for the model panchayat project. This would also help enhance the rather poor utilisation rate of Central funds by the State, Mr. Rajiv said.K.C. Venugopal, MP, said there was lack of clarity in implementation and funding pattern for the project. The States advanced development may prove its undoing in this scheme as in the case of many other Central projects. The ambiguity of asking MPs to select a panchayat of their choice instead of laying out concrete guidelines for selection exposed them to the risk of antagonising other panchayats in their constituency, he said."

This will help tame exorbitant increase in prices during July-October every year.The technology has been developed by Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and is in use in Maharashtra. Currently, Hindustan Agro Cooperative is using radiation technology for storage of two lakh tonnes of onions.It was discussed on Wednesday at a meeting of an inter-ministerial group called by road transport minister Nitin Gadkari in the backdrop of a sharp rise in retail prices in the three key kitchen staples in Delhi. It was attended by food minister Ram Vilas Paswan, agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh, food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and scientists from BARC.Paswan said many suggestions were made in the meeting including one that radiation centres should be set up alongside Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and Food Corporation of India (FCI) facilities in major metropolitan cities.The minister said BARC's radiation technology sounds good, but further discussions need to be held on this issue.Nuclear scientist Anil Kakodkar, who was also present in the meeting, allayed apprehensions and said food items treated by the radioactive technology is safe."

Despite this, the price of onions and potatoes has crossed the Rs 50 per kg mark.When TOI asked a senior official of the food and civil supplies department how many raids have they conducted so far, he said none. ""We are awaiting a related notification from the Karnataka government to go ahead with a check on hoarders.

Futures trading is seen as one of the key reasons behind disruption in supply chain. ""Trading in futures of other agricultural commodities may be permitted,"" the proposal says.The department has also proposed that the amendment Act shall cover all food items - both perishable and non-perishable.The proposal that has been put in public domain for suggestions and objections says all dealers and traders would be made to declare the stock quantity available with them. A new clause has also been proposed for securing the farmers' interest which says the government may prescribe that all farmer-trader transactions be reported to an authority.The proposed amendments, much of it drawn from the Narendra Modi Committee report on taming of food prices in 2011, say that violation of any of the provision in the Act will be treated as a cognizable and ""non-bailable"" offence.Under the proposed law, the states shall set up special courts with single judge appointed by the high court for speedy trial.In the proposed amendments in the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supply of Essential Commodities Act, the department has suggested that the period of preventive detention under the Act should be increased from six months to one year."

""People visiting the fair seem to care only for food,"" she said. To her surprise, the next stall actually had packed sambhar masala, rasam powder and idli chutney powder packs. ""The packs are selling more than the beads,"" confessed the stall owner. Such is the fascination of Delhi with food which makes every fair synonymous with a feast.This edition of ITTF (on till November 27) though not short of options will leave the foodie immensely dissatisfied. Not too long ago, the state pavilions, depicting industrial progress, also had food stalls with the best of cuisine from the region. The Rajasthan pavilion and food court comes closest to recreating that cultural and culinary experience this year. Not only does it have a colourful pavilion with a theme like Sunehri Kothi, a golden mansion built by late Nawab Ibrahim Ali Khan of Tonk - replete with stalls selling traditional bright fabrics, footwear, furniture and artefacts - it also has a buzzing food court outside. While popular street savouries such as dal baati churma, Jodhpur mirchi vada and kesar kulfi are available in abundance, the top draw is the kesariya kulhad tea sold by caterers from Nagaur region of the state.The central food court continues to draw visitors in hordes this year too. But rather than provide a gastronomic experience encompassing the entire country, these have standard Delhi staples like chhole bhature, chaat and tikki, popular South Indian dishes and fast food items. Under the 'Purani Dilli' signage, they serve chicken and mutton biryani, qorma, tikka and kebab but the real crowd-pullers are stalls serving Pakistani and Hyderabadi delicacies and even a quaint litti chokha counter. Ramesh from Mithapur district of Bihar says he got the idea to set up this stall after witnessing the popularity of dal baati churma at every fest. This sattu-stuffed savoury served with a brinjal preparation, mashed potato and coriander chutney had many takers. Another stall doing brisk business was the one selling vegetarian versions of Afghani kebabs, made using soya and cheese.Pakistani food stalls outside Hall No 6 are popular with people craving for Lahori mutton kadhai, palak gosht and Lahori kebabs. While these stalls claim to sell specialities of Gawalmandi Food Street near Lahore and had food lovers hooked, everyone though isn't happy with the pricing. ""The price of kebabs is double that of what I paid for the Hyderabadi ones. It wasn't worth the taste it offered,"" complained Sumit Juneja, who tried the dishes with his friends. The Pragati restaurant too has a Pakistani food counter. Most of the non-vegetarian 'Hyderabadi' stalls too had Delhi caterers manning them. ""Our chefs are from Hyderabad,"" was the usual reply one got on being asked about the cooks.While visitors have their cultural cravings satiated through various themes each state's pavilion had to offer, not everyone had their culinary yearnings satisfied. ""Not too long ago, cooks from each region added to the flair of this fair. We had ample options of Bengali, Oriya, Bihari, Maharashtrian and north- eastern dishes. Now it is becoming very standard in taste,"" said a regular."

""Though we have not reduced our potato intake, we do eat fewer tomatoes now. It is sad how we have to cut down on our basic needs now,"" she says.But the artificial inflation of tomato prices in the city was evident on a visit to the Khandsa Road vegetable market. While vendors there sold tomato for Rs 50/kg, in local markets catering to group housing societies, the vegetable's retail price increased up to Rs 80/kg. The price per kg for potatoes at the market on Thursday evening was Rs 25-30, bell pepper Rs 45-50, cauliflower Rs 30, ladies finger Rs 20 and brinjal Rs 20.With ever-increasing veggie prices, even vendors are unhappy.

In Punjab, two lakh acres of land is presently under seed potato cultivation.Potato harvesting machines, along with automatic potato planters, generated a lot of interest at the Agro Tech organized by CII at Chandigarh on Saturday.Anoop Singh Ahlawat, sales head of a German company, said that imported harvesters could cover 9-10 acres per day and ensure quality harvesting. ""Bruising of potatoes during manual harvesting is a major issue which leaves the yield unsuitable for chips ad wafers. Coupled with automatic potato planters, these machines bring down the need to hire labour in a big way. Moisture retention and proper spacing of seeds are the other benefits,"" he said.Given the high cost of machines, it is a group of potato farmers who are contemplating to buy these machines. But before taking the plunge, they are still in the process of studying it, to ensure that there is no scope for mechanical bruising. J B S Sangha, chairman of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers (POSCON), said that the machines came with standardization that had become significant these days.

When vegetable prices are spiralling, this only seems an even better too option.The trend of terrace farming is common not only with senior citizens and housewives but also among students and working professionals who lean towards eating organic food.When 66- year-old S S Radhakrishnan started growing vegetables on his terrace three years ago, people thought it was a waste of time as vegetables are easily available in markets. ""They hardly knew about organic food then. Now, more than 2,000 families have approached us to help set up a kitchen garden for them,"" says the retired customs official who promotes this concept through his NGO, Good Governance Guards. Radhakrishnan has written twice to the Prime Minister asking him to pass a message to people to produce their own food. ""If every household in Chennai can spare 500 square feet space in their balconies or terrace, the city can roughly produce 500 metric tonnes of food every day,"" he says. His garden produces 41 different vegetables including tomatoes, radish, yam and corn yielding him two kilograms of vegetables every day.35- year- old Raji Saravanan along with her 11- year- old son together nurture their one-month-old terrace garden where they plan to grown a variety of veggies including potatoes and onions, which are less easy to grow. ""We prefer organic food and we can eat fresh vegetables from our home and avoid the toxins,"" says Saravanan.These gardens also offer relief from the heat. ""The primary reason why we set it up was because we were feeling miserable in the heat,"" says 74- year- old Premilla Rajan. ""My husband and I have a small portion on the terrace right above our room and we certainly have cooler afternoons.""And for some it's simply the love of gardening that pushed them to grow their own vegetables, like the case of Veerendra and Pratima Mathur. ""We garden in a small space with about 20 pots as we live in an apartment. It's very simple to grow tomatoes, chillies, spinach, ladies finger and brinjal. Once we had a hundred tomatoes from just five pots,"" says Mathur.The cost of setting up a 500 sq feet garden including trough laying, overcast net for shade, is roughly around 10,000 which is a one-time investment and can be recovered in 8 months time, says Radhakrishnan.

The decisions to this effect were taken by the farmers body during a convention in Niphad taluka of the district on Sunday.MRSS leader Raghunath Patil told TOI, ""The central government decision to hike MEP to USD 500 a tonne has affected export. It is an indirect ban on onion export.

""As per norms, the minimum support price (MSP) is determined for the commodities under the ESA. But the MSP has not been declared for onions and potatoes.

418,Hospitals blind to bullet in neck ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1141127/jsp/calcutta/story_19093452.jsp,2014-11-27,Telegraph,"A bullet lodged in the neck apparently isnt an emergency in the eyes of government medical colleges in Bengal. Two of them allegedly turned away Burdwan resident Sheikh Naser Ali  they referred him elsewhere, which is officially the polite way of refusing treatment  after he had been shot at by robbers on November 19. A third state-run hospital in the city took him in but said no neurosurgeon was available to extract the bullet lodged between the cervical vertebra and left common carotid artery that supplies blood to the head and neck. Help me, please. I am going to die, Ali had repeatedly pleaded with doctors on the night his family brought him to the city for treatment. His anguished cry fell on deaf ears in government institutions inured to the helplessness of those who cant afford to go anywhere else. Ali, 49, was lucky to survive the apathy of a diseased public health care system that Mamata Banerjee had promised to turn into the epitome of efficiency and compassion. He has been recuperating in a private hospital since, though his mounting medical bill gives his unemployed son Jakir a jolt every day. Alis plight mirrors the misery of the common man in Bengal: packed government hospitals refuse admission and/or dont provide proper treatment and private health care steps in but exacts a heavy price. The bullet that almost killed Ali, a resident of Palsit in Burdwan, had been fired from close range. It pierced the left side of his neck and was lodged between the cervical vertebra and left common carotid artery that supplies blood to the head and neck. Ali could have been paralysed for life because of vertebra damage. Had the bullet hit the carotid artery, there would have been so much bleeding that the person could have died instantly, said R.N. Bhattacharya, director of neurosciences at AMRI Hospitals. The bullet did cause haemorrhage and thermal injury. The carotid artery became narrow. His pulse rate was dropping and we had to install a temporary pacemaker to stabilise him, Bhattacharya, who operated on Ali, said. According to doctors, delaying surgery for a few more hours would have been fatal. Ali, a resident of Sheikhpur village in Palsit, was barely a kilometre away from his home on the night of November 19 when two robbers accosted him. He was returning from his electrical repairs shop at Memari with around Rs 5,000 in cash to buy potato seeds when the incident occurred around 7.30pm. The robbers not only snatched Alis money but also fired shots from a countrymade gun as they fled. Some neighbours found my father, Alis son Jakir recounted. He was first taken to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, where doctors dressed the bullet wound but said they were equipped to do little else. We were told that a CT scan couldnt be done there at night. Since my father required one urgently, they referred him to SSKM, Jakir said. The family hired an ambulance to bring Ali to SSKM, which sent him from the emergency ward to the Bangur Institute of Neurosciences on the same campus. A doctor scribbled something on a piece of paper and sent us back to the emergency ward, only to be turned away because there was no bed, Jakir said. A doctor said the family could wait outside till daybreak, just in case someone vacated a bed. That was around 2am. Regret no bed vacant. Ref. To RG Kar MC (medical college) or other medical college or other state hosp, the doctor on duty wrote on the OPD patients ticket. Ali, still conscious and able to talk, was next taken to RG Kar where doctors examined him in the emergency ward. They said my father required surgery and there was no neurosurgeon available at that moment. They asked us to take him to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, Jakir said. By then, Ali was drowsy and slurring. CMCH admitted him but his family said he lay unattended for two hours. A doctor came around 7am and said no neurosurgeon was available, so treatment wouldnt start that day, Jakir said. The desperate family took Ali to AMRI Dhakuria, where the bill till Tuesday was about Rs 1.6 lakh. The one-and-a-half bighas of farmland Ali owns are his financial lifeline.

With the prices of tomatoes and onions skyrocketing,are resorting to tomato ketchup and buying in bulk from.IndoreanssabzihaatsIn the last few days, even the busiest of Indoreans have had to take out time for grocery shopping and bulk purchases from sabzi haats, and complicated preservation procedures, all in an attempt to keep up with the increasing prices of the most used vegetables like tomatoes and onions. According to data provided by the central government, the price of tomatoes in Indore touched a crazy 85 per kg last week  the highest in the country. The prices have given Indoreans enough reason to switch to a vegetable-less diet, and the vegetable vendors, lots to celebrate about. We spoke to Indore's price-hit people, who shared with us their plans of dealing with this price hike.Parul Mehta, an IT professional, says, ""I used to purchase vegetables on the weekend as I don't get time on weekdays. Last week when I saw the bill for the vegetables  especially onions and tomatoes  it came as a bit of a shock. This was way higher than the previous bills!"" She jokes, ""If this continues, the day is not far when I will have to buy the veggies on easy monthly instalments like other things. I just hope agar aisa kuch hua toh banks special offers provide karein vegetable loan pe (laughs).""Neha Sharma, a student, rues, ""As I live alone, I have to prepare food myself. And onions, potatoes and tomatoes are the basic vegetables required for an everyday meal. But looking at the crazy prices of these veggies, I don't know what to do. I have to also keep my monthly budget in mind. So now, I often eat daal-chawal and other things that don't require tomato or onion. As of now, I can't afford these 'fancy' items.""Megha Goyal, another homemaker, shares the same thought, ""I used to make tomato chutney with the meal, but after seeing tomato prices, I can't even think of it now. Now I serve tomato ketchup instead. In fact, I even purchased two extra bottles as I am afraid that soon tomato ketchup prices may also hit a high. Poha is a must for breakfast for my family and without onion, poha doesn't taste the same. So I have to cut down other expenses to manage things effectively."" Shantanu Jain, a student, says, ""I often go out for lunch and dinner at different restaurants, and I was surprised to see that owing to the price-rise, the hotels had removed tomatoes from their salad. If that wasn't enough, when I asked for tomatoes, they said I will have to pay extra for it. Finally I did pay extra for it as tomato ke bina salad ka maza hi nahi aata. Even at the poha stalls, they have stopped garnishing the dish with tomatoes.""Seema Jain, a homemaker, says, ""We do not use onions and so we essentially need tomatoes. But the price of the vegetable has burnt a hole in my pocket. Daam itna zyada hai jaise gold-plated tamatar ho. We might as well keep them in lockers! Anyway, for the time being, I have started using tomato essence. Although it doesn't really make up for real tomatoes, kaam chal jaata hai.""Radhika Maheshwari, a homemaker, sighs, ""I used to buy vegetables on a daily basis from a nearby mall but now, I have started going to the weekly haat to get a good deal for vegetables. I've started buying in bulk and I even bargain now, which I never used to do earlier."" Asha Gangwani, a tutor, tells us, ""I have brought some ready-to-eat mixes for gravy. Kyunki ab toh bachche bhi rajma or bhindi kha kar bore ho gaye hain.""Ram Prasad, a vegetable vendor at Sindhi Colony, says, ""After the price hike, people have started haggling even more while grocery shopping. They even come up with demands asking for complimentary coriander or lemon when they purchase tomatoes and onions, saying, 'Bhaiya, itni mehengi sabzi khareedi hai, kuch toh free dena padega.""Rajesh, another vendor at Sapna Sangeeta area, tells us, ""One day, a lady said, 'Bhaiya, itni mehengi sabzi lekar jaaungi to income tax waale raid maar denge.' I think tomatoes will soon become a status symbol!"""

Sales are brisk as customers look forward to seasonal vegetables and even though the days are still warm, the availability of red carrots and green peas is a clear sign that winter is here.At Navi Mumbai's Mafco Market, piles of green peas, mountains of juicy red carrots and red radishes are a common sight. ""During monsoon, many of the green leafy vegetables such as spinach and fenugreek are not eaten for health and hygiene reasons. But during these months, they are popular,"" said Navin Khote, a seller.Winter is a time when people eat more and vendors know nothing is more enticing that fresh vegetables. ""Even the vegetables such as cabbage and lady fingers produced now are of better quality. They are darker too, the same can be said of radishes and tomatoes,"" said Nikam Jadhav, another seller at the market.At any of the markets there is so much to choose fromcarrots, peas, beetroots, spinach, sweet potato and red radish. Since the season has just started, prices may seem a bit high, but vendors will tell you that transportation is what hikes up the rates.""After a week or so, prices will reduce once more veggies come into the market,"" said Narayan Patil, a wholeseller.While customers have been coming, many are waiting for prices to reduce. ""Seasonal vegetables are certainly healthy but since they are just out, prices tend to be a bit high. After a fortnight, not only will prices reduce but the quality will improve as well,"" said Radhika Prabhu, a customer."

If tomatoes are selling at Rs 91 per kg, prices of other vegetables are also very steep.Most of the residents have started visiting the wholesale vegetable market for bulk purchases of vegetables. The wholesale buying from the market yard makes the vegetables cheaper between Rs 10 and Rs 15 per kilogram.Nishit Patel, a resident of Vaishnaodevi Sky Apartment at Jehangirpura, has started visiting the wholesale market on the weekends. He takes orders of the residents in his apartment wing on requirement of the vegetables and makes the purchases accordingly.""It is better to buy vegetables from the wholesale market. The traders sell vegetables in bulk quantity. I make a list of the residents who want the vegetables in my apartment and then buy them from the wholesale market.

I serve them tomato ketchup now.""The residents in the Diamond City are also avoiding visiting restaurants.""One can't think of visiting restaurants on the weekends. The food items served at the restaurants have become costly. I have asked my wife and children to forget about restaurants till the prices come down,"" says Rakesh Prajapati, a private banker.However, the retail vendors in the vegetable markets remain unruffled.Rameshwar Prasad, a vegetable vendor at Palanpur Patia vegetable market, said, ""The monsoon began on a weak note and thus the market yards are not getting vegetables in good quantity.

To tide over the crisis, the state government would ensure buffer stocks of at least 3 lakh metric tonne (MT) during that period.A nine-member committee headed by food supplies and consumer welfare secretary M S Padhi has been entrusted with the task. Traders and cold storage owners are part of the committee, official sources said.""The committee would make arrangements to store the staple vegetable. The stock would be created in February-March and sold from August,"" Padhi told TOI.He said the government may bear losses for the time gap between buying and selling the tuber. ""We are going ahead with it to ensure stock during crisis and control the price rise,"" he said.The sources said 20% of the buffer stock would be sold in August, 30% each in September and October and 20% in November.The alternative arrangement was essential as the state produces only 2.5 lakh MT of potato against the annual requirement of about 10.5 lakh MT. Odisha depends on neighbouring West Bengal to meet around 80% of the state's requirement.The government recently approved Rs 50 crore for creating storage space and procuring potato from outside the state, the sources said, adding, Odisha State Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd (Markfed) will procure the tuber, while buffer stock operation will be done by Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation.At present, 15 cold storages, including five in the cooperative sector and 10 owned by private players, have agreed to earmark space for the buffer stock. The government is also in the process to create additional storage capacity in Jajpur district, the sources added."

With monsoon being below normal, there is a fear that price situation, especially food inflation, may further deteriorate in the coming days. Monsoon deficiency stood at 23 per cent in at the end of July.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is scheduled to announce its third bi-monthly monetary policy on August 5.State Bank of India (SBI) chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya said the RBI is likely to keep interest rate intact in the monetary policy review.""I think status quo (in policy rate) is more likely,"" she said.HDFC Bank deputy managing director Paresh Sukthankar said: ""Our view is that policy rates are likely to remain roughly stable.""He further said: At least, the assumption that we are built in to for the GDP growth in this year, we are counting on major tail winds from interest rate reduction. The pick-up in the economy that we are anticipating is really going to be driven more by the policy environment and the investments picking up but not necessarily on the back of lower interest rates.""According to Indian Overseas Bank, interest rates will remain same in this policy, but going forward there would be a downward bias.In the last policy review in June, RBI chose not to tinker with the policy rate. It was the second consecutive time that RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan kept interest rates unchanged.The repo rate, at which the RBI lends to banks, was retained at 8 per cent and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was kept unchanged at 4 per cent.The statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), the mandatory amount of bonds lenders must park at the RBI, was cut by 0.5 per cent to 22.5 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) with effect from June 14.America-Merill Lynch said it expects the rate cut to happen only in December, if the monsoon normalizes to cool down inflation, or early 2015 in case prices rise prolongs.""We continue to expect the Governor to be on hold on August 5...the RBI will be on long hold till it is clear that inflation is truly coming off,"" it said."

The famers sloganeered in protest against the government for anti-farmer decisions.Nashik district president of the Shetkari Sanghatana Arjun Borade told TOI, ""The Centre has included onions and potatoes in the Essential Commodities Act. This would help the government in restriction on storing the commodities and farmers would not be able to do so. Moreover, the Centre has hiked the MEP of onions to US$500 a tonne. Export of onions cannot happen at such a high MEP. This has led to a decline in onion prices causing huge losses to farmers.""Borade added, ""We had called a convention of farmers at Pimpalgaon to take a decision on the issue in the presence of our leader Sharad Joshi. After the convention, the farmers staged a 'rasta roko' on the Mumbai-Agra Highway in protest against the Centre's decisions."""

Move over onions and potatoes - there are at least six vegetables that have breached the Rs 100 mark, signifying alarming heights of inflation.On Monday, tomatoes sold at Rs 100 per kg in many areas of the city including the posh Vastrapur, Satellite, and Navrangpura. Seasonal vegetables recommended for consumption during the monsoon - like tindola, parwal (pointed gourd), cluster beans (guar), garlic, ginger and coriander - sold for over Rs 100 per kg.It needs mention here that while Ayurveda recommends enhancing ginger intake during monsoon as a digestive, coriander is used extensively in farali dishes made for people fasting during the holy month of Shravan.Ragini Patel, a Satellite homemaker, said that there was no control over the rising vegetable prices and retailers seemed to have made it a habit to quote a round figure. ""There have to be some checks. This kind of inflation is killing the appetite of people,"" Patel said.Vama Thakkar, a chartered accountant and homemaker in Paldi, said: ""The prices of vegetables are unimaginable. Earlier, we used to buy vegetables depending upon the season and requirements. Now the criterion is price."" She said this had led to a change in the buying patterns.The delayed onset of the monsoon in the state, followed by heavy rains in South Gujarat, north and even in Saurashtra, have led to price jumps. ""Usually if the monsoon arrives in June, vegetables start arriving in the market and this inflow reduces prices,"" said the chairman of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Babubhai Patel. ""But this time, the monsoon was delayed, which led to late sowing. This has impacted the arrival of vegetables in the market, making prices spike.""Babubhai Patel said that the new crop would start arriving within a week or so and hence the prices would start falling. Heavy rains in Gujarat have spoiled the crop and so prices have surged, he said. The prices of the vegetable will fall by mid-August when the fresh batch of crop arrives.Suran does a vanishing act:In this holy month of Shravan, yam - used as a substitute for potato by those who fast - has done a vanishing act. Where it is available, it comes at a cost which is almost double of that of potato.The yam which was priced at Rs 20-30 in the market earlier is available for Rs 50-55. However, in many areas like Satellite, yam has gone missing altogether. Market officials said that usually yam prices rise during Shravan, but this time touched unusual highs."

Bose appealed to all Left parties to come together and thwart the challenge of ""communal fascism"".""The paradox today is that a secular country is being run by a government led by a communal party. Our patriots such as Benoy, Badal and Dinesh are being portrayed in history books as terrorists. The new government at the Centre is trying to saffronise history school texts like the BJP did in Gujarat. The Trinamool Congress is also practising soft fundamentalism. On the economic front both the parties are taking the FDI route. Like Mamata's rail budget, the BJP government is also relying on the privatization, the PPP model and FDI for resource mobilization. The situation demands for all Left democratic and secular forces to take up the challenge,"" the Left Front chairman said, leaving the debate to the Party Congress if this fight against religious fascism would also include the discredited Congress.""It is time that we look beyond the Left Front. There is need for all Left parties to come together to take up the challenge. Some people ask me why our party is not replicating the model that it practised in the Seventies. The society has changed with the time. The organisational model pursued in the Seventies won't work,"" Bose said. Calling the present situation even worse than the Seventies, Bose said: ""The ruling party in the state has immobilized the administration. People are not getting justice.""Former chief minister and CPM politburo member Buddhadeb Bhattarcharjee harped on the communal theme in his brief speech. ""The tragedy is that the Lok Sabha polls have witnessed the emergence of right wing forces. The person at the helm is a full time RSS pracharak. This is a retrograde development marking the emergence of communal fascism under the garb of industrialization. The less said about Bengal, the better. Governments have failed in checking price rise. Rice is selling at Rs 32 a kilo, potato at Rs 18. Goons of the yester years are taking the lead in state affairs. We can't compromise on secularism and democracy,"" the CPM politburo member said. Sending out signals that he is not happy with certain trends in the communist party, Bhattacharjee said: ""We are trying to present the communist party that people would like to see.""Calling the BJP as the primary danger between the twin threats from the BJP and Trinamool Congress,CPM politburo member Surjya Kanta Mishra said: ""The BJP is like a cat, and Trinamool the mouse. Both can do harm. The mouse does harm in its own little way. Finally, the cat eats up the mouse. We have to fight both of them. There have been 15 riots in the country since the BJP came to power. In Bengal, industry has taken a back seat. Thousands have lost jobs. The chief minister bothers little for all these. She is running after pigs, putting them under mosquito nets while the endemic is spreading from north Bengal to south Bengal."""

Maybe this is the definition of good days of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that essential things would get costlier.He, however, said vegetables are costlier due to local weather affect.Vegetable vendor Vinod Gupta said, The prices of vegetables, which are mainly acquired from farms near Bhopal are costlier due to deficient rain and delay in winter.However, buyers feel that vendors were charging exorbitantly for making more profits.Shrikant Tiwari, 43, a resident of Arera Colony, said, Its become a trend that prices of vegetables soar during seasonal change. The government should take steps to stablise the prices of vegetables, otherwise I will have to tell my wife to learn more recipe of cooking fruits against vegetables.Hamidia vegetable market president Haseen Qureshi said, The deficient rainfall is the major reason behind rise in prices of vegetables. Beans and capsicum are being purchased from other states, which is also a reason behind the skyrocketing price of green vegetables. Even, potato is being imported from UP and Rajasthan as local potato crop got damages."

Speaking in unison, office-bearers of the West Bengal Potato Traders' Samity resolved on Friday to disobey the state's diktat to sell potato for Rs 14 a kg and stop sending the vegetables to Kolkata from Monday.The city gets bulk of its potato supplies from Hooghly and Burdwan. Supplies from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh meet the rest of the city's demand. Potato grown in West Midnapore, Bankura and other districts of Bengal does not meet quality demanded by city consumers.Traders in these districts said it was better to hoard potato than sell it at the government-stipulated rate. On Friday, the wholesale price of potato stood at Rs 16,000 a quintal which is equivalent to Rs 16 a kg. Office-bearers of the potato traders samity asked, ""If the wholesale price of potato is Rs 16 a kg, how does the government expect us to sell it at Rs 14 a kg in the retail market?""Further elaborating, the potato traders' leaders said, ""The price of all commodities is determined by forces of demand and supply. Potato can be no exception.From Friday evening, the usual long queues of trucks in front of cold storages were nowhere to be seen. Instead, policemen were seen posted in front of each cold storage storing potato, a move that further irked traders who questioned whether they were doing something criminal.Hooghly SP Sunil Chowdhury said, ""The enforcement directorate of the state police is checking all cold storages to see if any of them have stock of potato in excess of the quantity stipulated by the state agricultural marketing department. If any cold storage is found storing excess stock, action will be taken against it.""Minister Becharam Manna said, ""The state has taken the right decision by banning supply of potato to other states and ordering traders to roll back price to Rs 14 a kg."""

While retailers attribute the 30-50% difference in wholesale and retail prices to high transportation costs and reduced shelf life during monsoon, experts blame hoarding for the sharp increase.The prices of tomatoes in various vegetable markets in the city, including Qaiserbagh, Sadar, Narhi and Aminabad have come down from Rs 120/kg last week to Rs 70-80/kg now and that of onion from Rs 40/ kg to Rs 25-30/kg. However, potato, which was available at Rs 20-24/kg a few days ago, is now retailing at Rs 25-28/kg.Mohammad Shakir, a vegetable seller at Narhi, said, ""There is a shortage of potato due to lesser produce and because most of the potato stored in cold storage has been consumed. The prices are likely to increase further next month and up till the advent of winters,"" he added.Regarding the huge difference in wholesale and retail prices, wholesalers claim they are solely guided by market forces and prices fall when there is an increase in supply. They blamed retailers for keeping prices high. Satish Sonker, president of UP Fruits and Vegetables Association, said, ""We reduce the rates when there is ample supply. We have little control over the affairs of the retail market. They have their own rules of profit-making.""On the other hand, retailers say they have to carry vegetables from door-to-door, which requires a lot of time, energy and money. Also, loss is higher due to moisture this time of the year. ""We are small-time traders and cannot use refrigerators to protect vegetables from rotting,"" said Suresh, a retail vendor in Nishatganj.Professor in the economics department of Lucknow University, Yashveer Tyagi said, ""Besides transportation cost and damages due to weather, there are a large number of middlemen involved. Everyone has some profit margin which leads to the hike."" Vendors agree that middlemen make bulk purchases and hoard, creating an artificial supply crisis, leading to rise in prices. ""Government has no control over these middlemen,"" said Laik, a retailer in Aliganj.ADM trans-Gomti Ashok Kumar said more than 60% vegetables were damaged because of bad weather conditions this year, leading to the price rise. At present, he said, vegetables are coming from outside UP. He said prices of essential vegetables will come down in next 10-15 days when local supply resumes. He also said that the administration is keeping a strict watch on hoarding."

Jama adjoins Dumka, the constituency represented by Chief Minister Hemant Soren. Sita entered politics after her husband Durga Soren, Hemants elder brother, passed away in 2009 due to illness.In a free-wheeling interview with Abhay Kumar of Deccan Herald, Sita (the third most powerful leader in JMM after Shibu and Hemant) dwells at length on why the party should not be underestimated.Excerpts:Deccan Herald: Now that nearly half of the constituencies have gone to polls, do you regret not joining hands with the Congress. Do you think an alliance with the grand-old-party would have helped JMM check BJPs march to victory?Sita Soren: The answer is Yes and No. Yes because an alliance would have prevented split of non-BJP votes. And no because the Congress had become too big for its boots. It was making unreasonable demands.DH: Please elaborate..SS: Like it did in the Lok Sabha elections. The Congress contested 10 of the 14 Lok Sabha seats while leaving the rest four seats for us though we have a huge presence across Jharkhand. And the result was for everyone to see.The Congress lost in all the 10 seats while we won two of four seats. Similarly, it wanted a bigger piece in the pie this time too, without realising that its fortunes were on downswing.DH: What led to the collapse of the alliance? And secondly, is it not strange that Congress leaders continue to be ministers in outgoing Hemant Soren government and yet the JMM and Congress are fighting against each other?SS: What can we do? The seat adjustments or alliance, as you call could not fructify precisely because the demands made by the Congress were unreasonable. For example, the Congress wanted Pakur seat for former speaker Alamgir Alam, while we had a sitting MLA there (Aquil Akhtar).DH: So, you think that the BJP has an advantage because of JMM-Congress split?SS: Just wait till December 23. You will be surprised with the outcome of result as we are going to sweep Santhal Pargana region which has 18 of total 81 Assembly constituencies.DH: But the grapevine has it that the BJP is doing exceedingly well in urban areas like Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh?SS: Our party patriarch Shibu Soren and Chief minister Hemant Soren are working overtime to tell the voters to compare 14 years (when Jharkhand was created) vs 14 months (Hemant was sworn in as chief minister 14 months back).Unlike the BJP, we do not indulge in propaganda. Otherwise, tell me where are the achche din? In Dumka, potato is being sold at Rs 25 and onion at Rs 30.Is this what Modiji claimed to do during parliamentary polls when he said he will check price rise. You cannot fool all the people all the time.DH: But the BJP says that you, while contesting from Jama, were involved in horse-trading case of Rajya Sabha election and have got a conditional bail.SS: Yeh sab allegations niradhar hai (These are baseless allegations). They had also put my father-in-law Shibu Soren behind bars. These people (BJP) can go to any extent to crucify you.

In most places, potatoes did a vanishing act from the markets; where they were available, they acted extremely pricey, selling at Rs 30 to 40 a kg in a few places in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar.Throughout the day, the state government struggled to normalize supply from the neighbouring state with no avail. Food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma criticized the Bengal government for the curb. ""This kind of a dictatorial attitude is unfortunate and deplorable. I hope the supply will normalize soon,"" he said.A government statement said there was partial respite as 280 metric tonne potato reached the state from Bengal through alternative routes. The government would sell potatoes at Rs 20 a kg from 50 fair price shops rationing maximum 2 kg for a family in Bhubaneswar, besides from Udyan Fresh and Maitree outlets, it said. Food supplies and consumer welfare secretary Madhusudan Padhi said the district collectors had been given necessary instructions regarding this. He expressed hopes that over 3,000 metric tonne potato would reach the state from the Kanpur-based National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation within a week."

""The latest crisis is not because of any rain deficit. It is because of a whimsical decision of the West Bengal government,"" the officer said.After successive jolts to the potato supply from Bengal for two consecutive years, the state government has formulated a long-term action plan to become self-sufficient when it comes to this essential commodity. ""We currently produce around two lakh metric tonne (MT). Out attempt is to increase it to the state's annual consumption of around nine lakh MT,"" said horticulture director Sanjeev Chadha.Chadha said that according to the plan for tuber production approved by the chief secretary-led Odisha Horticulture Development Society in April, the government would soon sign an MOU with Peru-based Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP), a root crop research centre, to develop seed varieties suitable for Odisha.""We now buy seeds from Punjab at a very high cost. The Peru institute will help us create seeds suitable for the Odisha climate at a lower cost,"" he said. Besides seeds, more cold storages will be created, he added.Odisha has cultivated potato on around 5,000 acres mainly in Koraput, Kandhamal, Keonjhar and Mayubhanj districts this year. The state aims to harvest around 3.5 lakh MT potato in 2014-15."

Officials of the agriculture and agriculture marketing department were present at the meeting.The CM has again urged the traders forum and the task force members to see to it that potatoes do not go outside the state as the prices are rising and have already touched Rs 22 per kg. It has already been decided that potato-laden trucks will be stationed in three areas of the city throughout the day for sale at government-fixed rate of Rs 14 per kg.Sources said DMs of several districts have been told to check that potatoes are stored in the cold storages according to the prescribed amount as has been fixed by the government. A senior official said that police stations at several districts have been asked to check the ?challan' of trucks that are transporting potatoes.Within the city, where potatoes will be sold are Ultadanga, Parama island junction and Hastings junction. According to officials, The potatoes will be sold in packets ranging from 500 grams to 5 kg and customers will be able to buy a maximum of 5 kg at a time.Besides, potatoes will also be available at civic markets, including those at Ultadanga, VIP, Hatibagan, Sovabazar, Entally, Park Circus and Lake Market at the fixed price of Rs 14 per kg, as well as in the fair price vegetable shops located in the markets of Hastings, Milan Mela, Joka, Tollygunge, Posta, Kankurgachi, Behala and SakherbazarOfficials said that the Enforcement directorate along with the police has been asked to intensify vigil to take necessary measures and ensure that potatoes are sold at the fixed price. Officials said that presently, there is about 32 lakh metric tonne of potatoes stored in the cold storages.

Urging Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to waive the restriction on sale of potatoes to Jharkhand, Sao has reminded her of the fact that farmers in Bengal would suffer if their truck loads of potatoes are allowed to spoil in the rainy season.Talking to TOI, Sao said he has sent a copy of the letter to chief minister Hemant Soren asking him to take up the issue on his part as well. ""We are supplying water to Bengal through Massanjore dam and if Bengal is not ready to supply potatoes to us, we have every right to curtail water and power supply to them,"" he said, admitting that political constraints in Jharkhand have tied their hands from taking tough decisions.Potato prices remained at Rs.26-30 per kg in retail market on Saturday. Wholesale market sources said that only five trucks of potato arrived here causing further shortage in the market. ""Due to increase in prices there is a substantial reduction in the demand as a result of which whatever quota of potato is arriving here is sufficient,"" said Dharmendra Kumar, potato wholesaler at Kokar market.Principal Secretary, Food and civil supplies, Pradeep Kumar said that the department is keeping a close watch on the demand supply and availability of potatoes in market. ""Till date we have not received complaints about hoarding but the department would take action against the hoarders if they add to the already existing crisis,"" he said."

Goods trucks from either sides started plying normally from around 11 am on Saturday. Several truckloads of potato have already arrived in different parts of the state,"" the minister told the media. Dasburma said chief minister Naveen Patnaik had taken up the matter with his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee on Friday.Hundreds of Bengal-bound fish and eggs-laden trucks which BJD workers had stopped on Odisha side of the border in protest against curbs on potato-laden trucks to the state, were also allowed to leave.Dasburma said the government has 35,000 quintals of potato in Cuttack. Besides trucks from Bengal have started arriving in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Berhampur, Puri, Angul and Sambalpur, he said.The government rationed potato at the rate of Rs 20 a kg in 59 fair price centres in Bhubaneswar and 30 centres in Cuttack. The retail rates varied between Rs 28 and 35.The minister said potato procured through Kanpur-based National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) would reach the state by Wednesday, he said. To check hoarding and black marketing, the government has increased vigil and enforcement, he added.Dasburma said to overcome the frequent shortage of potato, the state government would soon formulate a long-term action plan. Agriculture, cooperation and food and civil supplies departments would work on the joint strategy. The first interdepartmental meeting for preparing the roadmap would be held every Monday, he said.The minister said the strategy will be to improve production, preservation and distribution.Odisha has already formed a long-term action to increase production from the current 2 lakh metric tonne to around 19 lakh metric tonne by 2019. At present, Odisha is at the mercy of West Bengal with 70% of state's demand coming from its neighbour.Odisha had faced a similar potato crisis after West Bengal restricted movement last year. Dasburma said since potato is an essential commodity, no state can restrict its barrier free movement.""We have also asked the Centre to ensure its uninterrupted movement,"" he said."
437,Tracing Ebolaâ€™s breakout to an African 2-year-old,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Tracing-Ebolas-breakout-to-an-African-2-year-old/articleshow/39992893.cms,2014-12-08,The Times Of India,"Patient Zero in the Ebola outbreak, researchers suspect, was a 2-year-old boy who died on December 6, just a few days after falling ill in a village in Gueckedou, in southeastern Guinea. Bordering Sierra Leone and Liberia, Gueckedou is at the intersection of three nations, where the disease found an easy entry point to the region.A week later, it killed the boy's mother, then his 3-year-old sister, then his grandmother. All had fever, vomiting and diarrhea, but no one knew what had sickened them.Two mourners at the grandmother's funeral took the virus home to their village. A health worker carried it to still another, where he died, as did his doctor. They both infected relatives from other towns. By the time Ebola was recognized, in March, dozens of people had died in eight Guinean communities, and suspected cases were popping up in Liberia and Sierra Leone  three of the world's poorest countries, recovering from years of political dysfunction and civil war.In Gueckedou, where it all began, ""the feeling was fright,"" said Dr Kalissa N'fansoumane, the hospital director. He had to persuade his employees to come to work.On March 31, Doctors Without Borders, which has intervened in many Ebola outbreaks, called this one ""unprecedented,"" and warned that the disease had erupted in so many locations that fighting it would be enormously difficult.Now, with 1,779 cases, including 961 deaths and a small cluster in Nigeria, the outbreak is out of control and still getting worse. Not only is it the largest ever, but it also seems likely to surpass all two dozen previous known Ebola outbreaks combined. Epidemiologists predict it will take months to control, perhaps many months, and a spokesman for the World Health Organization said thousands more health workers were needed to fight it.Some experts warn that the outbreak could destabilize governments in the region. It is already causing widespread panic and disruption. On Saturday, Guinea announced that it had closed its borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia in a bid to halt the virus's spread. Doctors worry that deaths from malaria, dysentery and other diseases could shoot up as Ebola drains resources from weak health systems. Health care workers, already in short supply, have been hit hard by the outbreak: 145 have been infected, and 80 of them have died.Past Ebola outbreaks have been snuffed out, often within a few months. How, then, did this one spin so far out of control? It is partly a consequence of modernization in Africa, and perhaps a warning that future outbreaks, which are inevitable, will pose tougher challenges. Unlike most previous outbreaks, which occurred in remote, localized spots, this one began in a border region where roads have been improved and people travel a lot. In this case, the disease was on the move before health officials even knew it had struck.Also, this part of Africa had never seen Ebola before. Health workers did not recognize it and had neither the training nor the equipment to avoid infecting themselves or other patients. Hospitals in the region often lack running water and gloves, and can be fertile ground for epidemics.Public health experts acknowledge that the initial response, both locally and internationally, was inadequate.""That's obviously the case,"" said Dr Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Look at what's happening now.""He added, ""A couple of months ago, there was a false sense of confidence that it was controlled, a stepping back, and then it flared up worse than before.""Health experts have grown increasingly confident in recent years that they can control Ebola, Dr Frieden said, based on success in places like Uganda.But those successes hinged on huge education campaigns to teach people about the disease and persuade them to go to treatment centers. Much work also went into getting people to change funeral practices that involve touching corpses, which are highly infectious.But in West Africa, Ebola was unknown.Ebola virus viewed under a microscopeIn some areas, frightened and angry people have attacked health workers and even accused them of bringing in disease.""Early on in the outbreak, we had at least 26 villages or little towns that would not cooperate with responders in terms of letting people into the village, even,"" said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization.The outbreak has occurred in three waves: The first two were relatively small, and the third, starting about a month ago, was much larger, Mr. Hartl said. ""That third wave was a clarion call,"" he said.At a House subcommittee hearing on Thursday, Ken Isaacs, a vice president of Samaritan's Purse, said his aid group and Doctors Without Borders were doing much of the work on the outbreak.""That the world would allow two relief agencies to shoulder this burden along with the overwhelmed Ministries of Health in these countries testifies to the lack of serious attention the epidemic was given,"" he said.In mid-March, Guinea's Ministry of Health asked Doctors Without Borders for help in Gueckedou.At first, the group's experts suspected Lassa fever, a viral disease endemic in West Africa. But this illness was worse. Isolation units were set up, and tests confirmed Ebola.Like many African cities and towns, this region hums with motorcycle taxis and minivans crammed with passengers.The mobility, and now the sheer numbers, make the basic work of containing the disease a monumental task. The only way to stop an outbreak is to isolate infected patients, trace all their contacts, isolate the ones who get sick and repeat the process until, finally, there are no more cases.But how do you do that when there can easily be 500 names on the list of contacts who are supposed to be tracked down and checked for fever every day for 21 days?""They go to the field to work their crops,"" said Monia Sayah, a nurse sent in by Doctors Without Borders. ""Some have phones, but the networks don't always work. Some will say, 'I'm fine; you don't have to come,' but we really have to see them and take their temperature. But if someone wants to lie and take Tylenol, they won't have a temperature.""At Donka Hospital in Guinea's capital, Dr Simon Mardel, a British emergency physician who has worked in seven previous hemorrhagic fever outbreaks and was sent to Guinea by the World Health Organization, realized this outbreak was the worst he had seen. A man had arrived late one night, panting and with abdominal pain. During the previous few days, he had been treated at two private clinics, given intravenous fluids and sent home. The staff did not suspect Ebola because he had no fever. But fever can diminish at the end stage of the disease.The treatment room at Donka was poorly lit and had no sink. There were few buckets of chlorine solution, and the staff found it impossible to clean their hands between patients.The man died two hours after arriving. Tests later showed he had been positive for Ebola. Untold numbers of health care workers and their subsequent patients had been exposed to the disease.Gloves, in short supply at the hospitals, were selling for 50 cents a pair on the open market, a huge sum for people who often live on less than a dollar a day. At homes where families cared for patients, even plastic buckets to hold water and bleach for washing hands and disinfecting linens were lacking.Workers were failing to trace all patients' contacts. The resulting unsuspected cases, appearing at hospitals without standard infection control measures, worsened the spread in a ""vicious circle,"" Dr Mardel said.As is often the case in Ebola outbreaks, no one knows how the first person got the disease or how the virus found its way to the region. The virus infects monkeys and apes, and some previous epidemics are thought to have begun when someone was exposed to blood while killing or butchering an infected animal. Cooking will destroy the virus, so the risk is not in eating the meat, but in handling it raw. Ebola is also thought to infect fruit bats without harming them, so the same risks apply to butchering bats. Some researchers also think that people might become infected by eating fruit or other uncooked foods contaminated by droppings from infected bats.Once people become ill, their bodily fluids can infect others, and they become more infectious as the illness progresses. The disease does not spread through the air like the flu; contact with fluids is necessary, usually through the eyes, nose, mouth or cuts in the skin. One drop of blood can harbor millions of viruses, and corpses become like virus bombs.A research team that studied the Guinea outbreak traced the disease back to the 2-year-old who died in Gueckedou and published a report in The New England Journal of Medicine. He and his relatives were never tested to confirm Ebola, but their symptoms matched it and they fit into a pattern of transmission that included other cases confirmed by blood tests.But no one can explain how such a small child could have become the first person infected. Contaminated fruit is one possibility. An injection with a contaminated needle is another.Sylvain Baize, part of the team that studied the Guinea outbreak and head of the national reference center for viral hemorrhagic fevers at the Pasteur Institute in Lyon, France, said there might have been an earlier case that went undiscovered, before the 2-year-old.""We suppose that the first case was infected following contact with bats,"" he said. ""Maybe, but we are not sure.""Dr Fazlul Haque, deputy representative of Unicef in Liberia, said that after a few cases there in March and April, health workers thought the disease had gone away. But it came roaring back about a month later.""It reappeared, and this time, it came in a very big way,"" he said. ""The rate of increase is very high now.""From July 30 to Aug. 6, Liberia's government reported more than 170 new cases and over 90 deaths.""Currently, our efforts are not enough to stop the virus,"" Dr Haque said.He added that most health agencies believed the true case numbers to be far higher, in part because locals were not coming forward when relatives fell ill, and because detection by the health authorities has been weak. Rukshan Ratnam, a spokesman for Unicef in Liberia, said some families had hidden their sick to avoid sending them to isolation wards, or out of shame stemming from traditional beliefs that illness is a punishment for doing something wrong.Dr Haque said that the tracing of cases, crucial for the containment of the disease, was moving too slowly to keep up with new infections. Seven counties have confirmed cases, and the government has deployed security forces in Lofa County, where Liberia's first case was detected, he said. But the government has given leave to nonessential employees in those areas, so it is not clear how they will have the staffing to isolate the sick. Some hospitals have closed because so many health workers have fallen ill.Liberia has closed markets and many border crossings. It has said testing and screening will be done at immigration checkpoints.But on Thursday, at a checkpoint staffed by at least 30 soldiers in Klay, Bomi County, there was no screening  just a blockade and a line of trucks loaded with bags of charcoal, plantains and potato greens.Hilary Wesseh, a truck driver who was sucking the last drops of juice out of a small lime, said he had been stuck there for two days.""They are holding us hostage,"" he said.By June and July, Sierra Leone was becoming the center of the outbreak. At the government hospital in Kenema, Dr Sheik Umar Khan was leading the efforts to treat patients and control the epidemic.But he was desperate for supplies: chlorine for disinfection, gloves, goggles, protective suits, rudimentary sugar and salt solutions to fight dehydration and give patients a chance to survive. Early in July, he emailed friends and former medical school classmates in the United States, asking for their help and sending a spreadsheet listing what he needed, and what he had. Many of the lines in the ""available"" column were empty. One of his requests was for body bags: 3,000 adult, 2,000 child.Before his friends could send the supplies, Dr Khan contracted Ebola himself. He died on July 29."
438,Contract farming silence in farm bill,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1141209/jsp/bengal/story_2772.jsp,2014-12-09,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Dec. 8: Private companies will be able to buy farm produce directly from farmers in Bengal. But the widely-anticipated whoop of exultation from Indian industry over the amendment in the state's agri-marketing act was somewhat muted because of the lack of clarity on the issue of contract farming and the absence of clear guidelines on whether the state government would provide incentives and help in the acquisition of land for private terminal marketing complexes. Industry leaders from the retail and food processing sectors across the country welcomed the changes in the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) (Amendment) Bill, 2014, passed in the Assembly while cautioning that the change may not yield immediate results. ""You cannot fault what has been done today. If I were to do this (amendment), it would have been the same. I had only hoped that there would be greater clarity on contract farming,"" said the head of a national retail chain who did not wish to be named. There are three key elements in the model legislation that the Centre had prepared in 2003 to help states re-draw the contours of agriculture marketing in the country: contract farming, direct marketing of farm produce to consumers and the creation of private mandis. Only 16 states have embraced all three elements listed in the model legislation: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Tripura, according to a report on the food processing industry prepared by Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER). The bill passed today is silent on the aspect of contract farming even though it allowed private players like Reliance Retail, Spencer's, Big Bazaar and Keventer to buy farm produce directly from the farmers or through a commission agent, set up brihat krishak bazaars or terminal markets while promising to hand over to private players block-level markets that have been developed by the state. The block-level markets are called krishak bazaars. ""Buying directly from farmers is all very good and we are doing it already with due licence. However, the game changer would have been contract farming. We need certainty that the fresh produce would be made available at the right size, quality and cost throughout the year,"" a retailer said. Contract farming has always been a hot potato for the political establishment in Bengal with the erstwhile Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government also shying away from such reform. The Left Front had balked at the idea of agriculture marketing reforms because of stiff opposition from Forward Bloc, which used to control the terminal markets across Bengal. In contract farming, both the farmer and the private company have certain cast-iron obligations. Private companies provide the technology, seed varieties, pesticides and credit to the farmer. In turn, the farmer promises to sell his entire produce to the private company at a pre-determined price. Companies are unwilling to invest money or enter into such arrangements unless the farmer is prepared to make a firm commitment on the sale of his entire produce to them. Bengal politicians have been wary of such arrangements as they fear that the big boys of business would eventually control the crop and determine the farmers' fortunes, which could damage the rural vote bank. However, a section of retailers and processors said direct buying might help in specific cases. ""If you have large-scale and specific requirement for a particular variety of produce, this would help,"" said a retail executive. A national retail chain with deep pockets said large corporates would be interested in investing in Bengal after today's changes in the bill. For instance, Reliance Industries Ltd holds land in several districts of Bengal. The land parcels could now come in handy to build markets or processing units that will cater to its stores across India. The company could not be reached for comment. But for retailers running on wafer-thin margins, the option of setting up a terminal market may not be immediately feasible. ""There is an established system in mandis. The market participants provide credit and ensure home delivery to the seller. Can we do that? Plus, if the buyers don't turn up, the farmer will also not come to the private market to sell his produce,"" said an industry veteran. The bill is silent on whether any incentive will be provided to the private players to build terminal markets. In 2009, then minister of state for agriculture and consumer affairs K.V. Thomas had said in reply to a question in the Lok Sabha that a subsidy of up to 40 per cent of the project cost, or a maximum sum of Rs 50 crore, could be offered to a private entrepreneur intending to set up a terminal marketing complex under the National Horticultural Mission Scheme. He went on to add that the subsidy would only be given in those states that undertook reforms in agricultural marketing. The private entrepreneurs would be picked under a bidding process to be carried out by the respective states. He had also said that land for the terminal market complex ""will be made available by the respective state governments"". The Bengal bill makes no mention of the subsidy or the provision of land for the private marketing complexes. Across Asia, buyers tend to source fresh produce from local markets instead of modern retail stores. This trend is even more discernible in India. ""Even if somebody buys dry groceries from modern retail stores, the buyer goes to the local market for fresh produce,"" said a retailer. PROS AND CONS What the bill proposes Private players can buy produce directly from farmersGovernment to hand over block-level markets to private investorsPrivate investors can develop district-level marketsLicences to private companies for a fee to buy, store, process and sell agriculture produceCompanies can engage commission agents Bill silent on Contract farmingState help in acquiring land for district marketsIncentives such as power, tax relaxationUpper limit for procurement"
439,Potato crisis may spur price rise in West Bengal,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Potato-crisis-may-spur-price-rise-in-West-Bengal/articleshow/40021058.cms,2014-12-09,The Times Of India,"TARAKESWAR/MIDNAPORE/SURI: The Mamata Banerjee government's potato export ban to Odisha and Jharkhand has raised the spectre of a reciprocal action by the states, affecting the prices of not just potato but other essential commodities which reaches Bengal from these states. 119 trucks of potatoes have been seized so far and the entire lot stored in three sites at Milan Mela complex, Ultadanga and Hastings, being sent sporadically to different KMC wards to be sold at a regulated price of Rs 14-per-kilogram. The potato traders who are going on a strike on Monday claim much of the produce will rot by the time this happens precipitating into loses.While Odisha is solely dependent on potatoes from Bengal, much of this tuber produced in Bengal are marketed in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bihar and Jharkhand. Odisha chief minister Naveen Pattanaik had spoken to Mamata on it, leading to a temporary relief. Hundreds of Bengal bound fish and eggs-laden trucks, which were stopped on the Odisha side of the border by BJD activists in protest against curbs on potato-laden trucks to the state, were then allowed to move out. ""We have allowed the fish trucks to West Bengal after they agreed to send potato to Odisha,"" BJD MLA from Jaleswar Aswani Patra said. But the respite ended too soon. ""I am not aware of any such lifting of embargo,"" Arup Ray, agricultural marketing minister said.But, Odisha's food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma, who on Saturday had announced that the crisis was resolved with West Bengal lifting the curb, said, ""The neighbouring state's behaviour is unfortunate. After allowing some trucks, the government has again stopped the inter-state movement of potato again.""The Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) of Jharkhand threatened to launch agitation to mount pressure on the Jharkhand government to immediately resolve the potato ban issue.""If other states stop exporting vegetables, egg, onions, fish and essential items to Bengal, what will happen here?"" BJP state President Rahul Sinha asked.Aurobinda Roy, Subrata Pal and Montu Samanta potato traders from Hooghly and Burdwan  are evidently worried. ""A truck of potato is worth nearly Rs 3 lakh. Every truck carries anything between 310-410 bags of potatoes, each weighing 50 kgs. When our trucks were stopped and sent to Kolkata's Milan Mela grounds, we were promised Rs 650 per bag. When we went to discuss the matter, they said that we would receive only Rs 600 per bag as per instructions from Nabanna. We aren't even being issued any receipts. We purchase a bag of potatoes for Rs 810 and sell it for Rs 820 in states like Andhra Pradesh, Telengana and Assam. What if the traders waiting in those states lodge cases against us? Unless they receive the bags, they won't pay us and we can't pay the farmers. Everybody will lose,"" Roy said.Trucks have been stopped at Egra, Dantan, Belda, Magrampur, Chirkunda, Md Bazaar and Sevoke. 11 trucks were stopped from entering Dumka at Md Bazar check-post and sent back to the coldstores in Hooghly's Arambag. Santanu Manna, Pragatishil Alu Byabsayee Samity president, said the restrictions won't help as the market is guided by demand and supply. ""In places like Delhi and Mumbai, potato is selling for Rs 30 per kg and more. Here, the government hopes to sell at Rs 14 per kg. This is not possible."" he said.Lalu Mukherjee, the Hooghly district secretary of the Samity said: ""This is an Rs 2,000 crore business. The marginalized and poor farmers are waiting for the money before the Pujas. Unless they receive it, there will be no celebrations."" Dinabandhu Mondal, the secretary of Birbhum District Potato traders Association said , ""The main problem is that this year the production of potato was not as per expectation. Naturally there is a shortage in supply.""Dasburma further stated: ""Since it is an inter-state conflict, we will strongly take up the matter with the Centre. Potato being an essential commodity, it is for the central government to ensure its barrier-free movement.""Minister of state for agriculture Becharam Manna, however, indicated that the drive will continue. ""We have nothing against the traders. The government has examined all pros and cons before taking action. We will stick to our stand,"" he said.This year, the potato production is Bengal was nearly Rs 95 lakh tonnes (1 crore tonnes as per the government). The 430 potato cold storages in the state can stock only about 60 lakh tonnes. The remaining has to be sold fast, traders argue. Potato is stocked into the cold storages in December and brought out in March. Between December and February, people have the new potato available in the market. At present, there are 31 lakh tonnes of potato stocked in the cold storages.Between Saturday evening and Sunday morning, 52 truckloads of potato were sent from Dantan in West Midnapore to Kolkata. The Paschimbanga Ganatantrik Alu Byabsayee Samity has also decided to join Monday's strike. State secretary Baren Mondal claimed that the trucks are getting looted. While traders in Bengal said that no trucks from Odisha are being allowed to enter Bengal due to an agitation there, BJD MLA Ashwini Patra denied this. According to him, nearly 1,000 trucks of fish, eggs and onions have been allowed to leave Baleswar for Bengal even though Odisha is facing a severe potato crisis.Sources said after bilateral discussions between chief ministers of Odisha and Bengal, goods trucks from either side started plying from 11am on Saturday.

Worse, the cold storage owners have also demanded state intervention to check 'police excesses'.Urging the state to go into the root of the problem without imposing price cap, members of 'Kolkata O Sahartali Aloo Piyaj Byabsayi Samannay Samity' (the co-ordination committee of potato and onion in Kolkata and its adjacent areas), said, ""We only work on commission and get Rs 15 per packet. We don't have the capability to control the price and now the government is asking us to lower it. If we buy the product at Rs 850 per packet (50 kilogram), how can we sell it for Rs 600?""""We will submit a memorandum urging the government to buy the potatoes from the farmers or cold-storage owners and sell it to us. Then only we can sell the potatoes at the government-prescribed rate,"" president of the coordination committee Sukomal Saha said. ""If the government doesn't pay heed, then we will have no other alternative but to shut down our business,"" a member of the coordination committee said.The government has fixed the potato price at Rs 12 at the wholesale market and Rs 14 at the retail market. But, according to insiders, the rate is absurd as in most of the cases the wholesalers buy a 50 kilogram packet at a rate ranging from Rs 760 to 850. ""The market rate is fixed every day at 7 pm by Kumrul Mokam (market) in Hooghly and we sell the potatoes according to that rate. If we sell it at a lower rate, then no one will give us potatoes from the next day,"" Debraj Roy, a wholesaler of Shyamabazar, said.""The potatoes being sold by the government is so bad in quality that it is not fit for the Kolkata market. In most of the cases, only 45 kilograms of potatoes are found in a packet instead of 50 kilograms. Of it, at least 10 kilograms are rotten,"" said secretary of Kolkata Potato Retailers Association, Debu Prosad Dey. The condition of the cold storages is worse. ""Representatives from the government are telling us to sell potatoes at Rs 12 per kilogram. They are even threatening us to put behind the bars if we don't comply with the order. We don't know what to do,"" Sanjay Nayek, a cold storage owner in Burdwan, said."

Odisha has sufficient potato stock in different cold storages. But the government did nothing to intervene even as traders jacked up prices and charged consumers Rs 50 a kg at places.""The state as of now has potato stock that can comfortably meet the need for more than one month,"" admitted food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma.Asked why the government did not intervene in the beginning and allowed traders to fleece the gullible consumers in the name of 'no supply from West Bengal', the minister said, ""The government took steps to overcome the crisis.""The government instead created an impression that there was no potato stock available in the state and Nafed had been requested to rush over 3,000 quintal to tackle the crisis. By Monday, officials said, not a single kg of Nafed potato had reached Odisha. ""The crisis from lack of tuber supply from West Bengal also continues,"" an officer said.Dasburma said Bhubaneswar has a stock of about 35,000 quintal of potato followed by 32,000 quintal in Cuttack and 20,000 quintal in Balasore. ""The stocks are with private traders. We have started intervening with all seriousness for last three days. The stocks have been brought under government control and we will regulate the distribution,"" he added.The state government has decided to set up at least 15 cold storages in next one year. Lack of storage facility has been one of the major reasons for frequent potato crisis in the state, said agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy.""Odisha does not have a single multi-purpose cold storage. The state government should have set up more such facilities to preserve huge amount of perishable items, including potato and vegetable,"" he said.""At least 15 cold storages will be established by the end of this year. The state government has plans to set up cold storage in all blocks within next five years,"" he said. Two multi-purpose cold storages at Titilagarh and Panikoili will start operating within a month, he added.The state has only 23 cold storages now of which 15 are government-run. The cooperation department is running six cold storages, the horticulture directorate looks after five such units while four others are operational under state-run Agricultural Promotion and Investment Corporation of Odisha Limited.The state produces two lakh tonne of potato as against the total requirement of nine lakh tonne. The state has been procuring rest of the requirement from West Bengal and other states.""The potato traders in West Bengal are on agitation, protesting their government's restriction on the transportation of the tuber to others states, including Odisha. The businessmen in Bengal are suffering huge losses due to the Trinamool Congress government's decision,"" said Dasburma.While announcing that government's market intervention would continue till the crisis eases, Dasburma said the government will continue to sell the essential item through PDS outlets and Maitree stores in the state.No truck, carrying potato from West Bengal, entered Odisha either through Laxmannath or Jamsola check gates since Sunday morning, officials said.""A few trucks may have sneaked into Odisha area through village routes. But that is unlikely to make any significant impact in resolving the potato crisis in the state,"" an officer said, requesting anonymity. ""Only about 70 trucks were allowed to cross both the gates from Saturday evening to Sunday morning. After that the West Bengal government allowed no potato vehicle to move.Hundreds of trucks, carrying goods to West Bengal and coming from there, were stranded on Kolkata-Mumbai NH-49, on the outskirts of Keonjhar town, following a 12-hour road blockade by BJD workers. The blockade was staged to protest against West Bengal government's decision to stop potato supplies. The blockade was lifted in the evening."

Prices of potato at New Market was between Rs 20 and 22 on Monday, while a gross variety of the crop, being sold as 'sarkari aloo' (potato supplied by the state government), was priced at Rs 14.Kamal Banerjee, a trader at New Market, said, ""It is not possible for us to lower the prices. Power and fuel costs have gone up. Therefore, wholesale traders are selling at increased prices.""The retailers feel the customers in the city consume the best quality of the crop commonly known as 'super-sorting grade'. According to them, 'sorting-grade' of the crop which has some amount of 'gross variety' mixed with it can be sold at lower prices. ""But the customers in Kolkata do not accept such varieties,"" said Mangalmay Haldar, a vegetable trader at the Lake Market. Potato was being sold at Rs 22-24 per kg in the market on Monday.Despite a high price at the local retail markets, potato prices were kept between Rs 19 and 26 at the city malls. Spencers' sold 'Jyoti' variety at Rs 20 per kg while baby potato was being sold at Rs 19 per kg. 'Chandramukhi' variety was sold at Rs 26 per kg in the mall. On the other hand, Future Group's Big Bazar sold 'Jyoti' variety of potato at Rs 22 per kg. While prices have gone up at the local markets in last one week, it has increased by merely 10 paisa per kg at the city malls.How could city malls sell the crop at a lower price while the local retail markets demanded a premium? According to cold storage owners, local retailers can sell the 'Jyoti' variety of potato even below Rs 20 per kg. Rampada Paul, president of West Bengal Cold Storage Association, said: ""After potato is loaded at cold storages, it changes many hands before it reaches the retailers. There is an average premium of Rs 2.50-3 per kg which is added during the process."" According to him potato was loaded at Rs 780-790 per 50 kg packet at the cold storages on Sunday. ""It comes to Rs 15.60 per kg at the cold storage points. If you add Rs 3 as transport charges and commission charged by middlemen it reaches the retailer at Rs 18.60 per kg,"" he said.Patit Paban Dey, member and former president of West Bengal Cold Storage Association, said potato prices have already started coming down at the cold storage points.

Not that this assistant manager of the civic assessment department cannot buy the vegetable at the higher rate, Saha's problem is that she has to wake up at 5am every day to sell it at a cheaper price in the local municipal market.This 40-year-old Behala Chowrasta resident and a mother of two has to stay put at the market till the stocks last. Not that she is exempted from her duty as a senior official of the assessment department. After completing the 'special' assignment, she has to attend office regularly.Following an instruction from the chief minister's office to open fair-price shops at all civic markets, municipal commissioner Khalil Ahmed recently issued a circular requisitioning 264 Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) employees to be posted at different markets to sell potatoes. Some of these employees are senior officials (assistant or deputy managers), who were reluctant to be part of the team. But none could muster the courage to defy the municipal commissioner's diktat.No one can escape their duties, MMiC (market) Tarak Singh made it clear. Assessment department chief manager Souvik Sikdar has to prepare a report of the sale proceeds and hold a meeting with the MMiC every evening.Besides assessment, the civic body's market department employees are also part of the team that is now selling potatoes at 27 markets across the city, including Ultadanga, Manicktala, College Street, Gariahat, Lansdowne, Lake, Behala Parnasree, Sakherbazar, Jadavpur, Santoshpur and Bijoygarh markets.The task assigned to the KMC market department officials is to unload potatoes from trucks and sell these to customers who queue up in front of the municipal markets. The stock, which comes from the state agriculture marketing department, is sold at Rs 14 a kilo.Chinmoy Chatterjee, a KMC market department employee, looked worried on Tuesday evening when information reached the KMC headquarters that 22 truckloads of potatoes had been distributed among 27 municipal and other private markets across the city. ""We have to sell these potatoes over two to three days. This is in addition to our daily work,"" he complained.Chatterjee was even more worried to learn that from Wednesday, civic employees would also have to check the quality of potatoes being sold after complaints poured in at the civic headquarters that in some municipal markets, rotten potatoes were being vended. The MMiC, however, felt that the civic team had so far done a fair job to ease the pocket pinch of the common man."

My ministry has succeeded in promoting an international food park here by extending a subsidy of `50 crore. In the near future, you will see many more parks and food processing units coming up in the state,"" she said after inaugurating the park, the fourth one in the country.""The Indian Tobacco Company (ITC) is coming up with a `1,000-crore food park in Kapurthala. At the same, they are also promoting the establishment of a cold chain for which we are giving a subsidy of `10 crore, besides creation of modern processing centres for milk, fruits and vegetables,"" she said.Urging farmers to add value to their crops, she said they could also form small self help groups (SHGs) for this purpose as it is need of the hour to add value to fruits and vegetables grown in Punjab, she said.""We need to process kinnows, tomatoes and potatoes in much larger quantities to usher in a food processing revolution in the state,"" she added.She food processing was growing at 8.6% against the industrial growth rate of 6% and agriculture at 3%.""However, much more needs to be done as we are only processing 10% of our food produce. This lack of processing is resulting in food wastage of 6 to 18% which, calculated at `45,000 crore, is equal to the total food consumed by England,"" she said.Meanwhile, Sukhbir said that diversification would become a reality with the setting up of more food parks and farmers would be able to earn as much as `1 to `1.5 lakh by supplying their produce to the food parks.He also announced that a textile unit was also likely to be set up in this belt, which would boost cotton farmers as well as the cotton industry.Chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) of the park Sukhinder Singh said that the park, spread over 55 acres, would have facilities for processing milk and milk products besides packaging vegetables and fruits. He said the park had tied up for production and marketing with renowned companies.The park will also create at least 700 jobs for local youth. More youngsters would be employed in the park once other companies also established their units in the facility."

The data reflects falling cost of production in the economy largely on the back of the sharp contraction in global prices of crude and commodities. It also reflects moderating food prices.The data, however, shows a larger drop than the actual decline in prices owing to favourable statistical illusion of a high base: wholesale inflation growth was 7.5 per cent in November, 2013.Wholesale food inflation was down to 0.6 per cent against 19.7 per cent in November, 2013, with prices of cereals, rice, wheat, vegetables and onions falling. However, potatoes and milk continued to show high inflation. While potato prices grew at the rate of 34 per cent, the rate of rise in milk prices was 10 per cent. Rice and pulses too rose but at slower pace of 5.6 per cent and 4.4 per cent. With global crude prices down nearly 40 per cent since June, wholesale inflation in fuels came in at minus 4.9 per cent against 11.08 per cent in November, 2013.The dip in producer prices comes days after consumer price inflation abated to an 8-year low of 4.4 per cent.Former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Virmani told The Hindu that 0 per cent inflation showed that there was fundamental change in world economy. The commodity boom is over, food prices peaked six months ago, and the cycle has turned and global growth will be weak. He said that all the economic data for India was reflecting a sharp drop in consumption, especially with real rural wages falling. There was a strong case for the interest rates to be lowered for spurring investments and growth, he said.India is an inadvertent beneficiary of the global oil price fall and so the government must find a way of converting the triple bonus [of narrowing fiscal and current account deficits and falling inflation] to be had from it into higher growth for which the government must generate sustained investments by alleviating the infrastructure bottlenecks, Aditya Birla group Chief Economist Ajit Ranade told The Hindu .Data shows a larger drop than the actual decline in prices owing to favourable statistical illusion ofa high base"

The dip in price level has intensified the pressure on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates.Data released by the commerce and industry ministry showed the annual rate of inflation, based on monthly WPI, declined to 0.0% in November compared to 1.8% for the previous month and 7.5% during the corresponding month of the previous year. In September, the inflation stood at 2.4%. While the RBI gives more weightage to retail inflation when it reviews interest rates, the sharp dip in the wholesale inflation rate is expected to a trigger a fresh round of a vociferous demand for lowering rates to boost growth and investment.The sharp easing comes after recent data showed retail inflation slowed to a multi-year low of 4.4% in November. Data showed wholesale vegetable prices dropped 29% in November, while overall food inflation slid to 0.6% year-on-year. Fuel prices declined nearly 5% year-on-year, while manufactured product prices slowed to 2%. Some vegetables such as potato displayed stubborn price pressure, rising 34% in November, while onion prices, which had stoked anxiety a few months ago, fell 56.3%. Milk, fruits prices continued to be in double digits.""Following the drop seen in November CPI (consumer price inflation) to 4.4% y-o-y, the WPI data surprised on the downside coming in at 0% y-o-y, lowest since July 2009. The decline in WPI was once again broad based  across food, fuel and manufactured goods. While food and fuel inflation trends have been helped by supply-side factors and base effect, the decline in core WPI inflation to 2.2% from 2.5% reflects subdued demand pressure as well. Today's data reinforces our view that rates could be eased cumulatively by 100 basis points by FY16. Some economist said the data should be viewed with caution as it could signal weak demand in the economy and point to deflation.""Inflation has fallen too far. What matters is manufacturing and a manufacturing inflation below 3% points to deflation. It is not very good,"" said Pronob Sen, chairman of the National Statistical Commission. The finance ministry has strongly backed a rate cut given the sharp moderation in inflation. ""This should induce RBI to rethink its cautious monetary stance and urgently move towards a growth propelling monetary policy. RBI should not wait till the next monetary policy announcement and reduce interest rate substantially, as industrial production is in the red and investment and consumption demand is yet to show visible signs of a pick-up,"" said Ajay S Shriram, president of industry lobby group CII."

However, retail prices are still higher than the lows in summer, and traders expect the prices to come down further.In June, onion prices were ruling at Rs 12-15 per kg and subsequently started moving up, with the prices peaking in September at Rs 40 per kg. At present, good quality onions are available for Rs 20-22 per kg in the retail markets.""With new crop arriving in the mandis, prices of good quality onions have come down to Rs 700 per crate (40 kg) and that of low quality are trading at Rs 300-350 per crate,"" wholesale trader Vinod Kumar told HT. The prices are expected to come down further, he said.At present, onions arriving in the market comprise both summer stock and fresh kharif crop, say traders. This year, the kharif onions, which arrive by mid-September every year, were delayed by two months due to delay in arrival of monsoon. At present, only 60% of total arrival is of fresh kharif crop.Unseasonal rains in summer coupled with the weak start of the monsoon season had destroyed a portion of crop in Maharashtra and lead to scarcity.On top of that, the prices of seeds had shot up as there was some scarcity in the market. Prices of the potatoes have also come down to Rs 24 per kg from Rs 35 per kg but are ruling higher than Rs 20 per kg levels in summer."
455,Three reasons why rising food prices could be here to stay,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Three-reasons-why-rising-food-prices-could-be-here-to-stay/articleshow/40387597.cms,2014-12-17,The Times Of India,"MUMBAI: None of the standard explanations quite explain the rise in food prices India has seen: pronounced since 2006 and alarming after 2010. Drought and poor rain? The country has seen good aggregate rainfall in most of those years. Spike in global prices? Those were high in 2007-08, not now. Fragmented value chains that allow middlemen to grab large margins? The value chain has always been fragmented.Growth has slowed in the last three years, but food inflation hasn't. After hitting 15.2 per cent in 2009-10, food inflation, notes former Planning Commission member Abhijit Sen, fell to 6.3 per cent in 2011-12. And then, it jerked up again, growing at 11.9 per cent and 12.4 per cent in 2012-13 and 2013-14, respectively.The cast of commodities fanning these high numbers  and making households, central bank governors, finance ministers and company CEOs fret  have kept changing. Back in 2008, it was foodgrains and food products. By the fourth quarter of 2010, it was fruits and vegetables, led by onions. After that, cereals and pulses again. And, today, it is tomatoes and potatoes.It is not very clear what explains these patterns. In most diagnoses doing the rounds, comments Sen, the question of food inflation ""pre-dates the inflation itself"". For instance, he says, the theory that blames inflation on India's agriculture markets (or mandis) has been around since the early 2000s. With this surge in prices, Sen says, ""all the old views that say the government should not have anything to do with agriculture have come back out of the cupboard.""This lack of clarity on the reasons for food inflation could force the Narendra Modi-led NDA government into a tight spot. In a country with high malnourishment, and reducing per capita availability of cereals and pulses, among others, consistent price rise further aggravates food  and nutrient  deficiencies.It also threatens to rapidly erode the social capital of the Modi government. ""If Modi doesn't tackle onions, potatoes and tomatoes, his credibility will be gone,"" says Ashok Gulati, former head of the Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).The government knows this. In the last two months, it asked state governments to allow farmers to bypass mandis and sell fruits and vegetables in the open market. It has added onions and potatoes to the Essential Commodities Act to check hoarding. It wants to cap the bonus states can add to the MSP. And it is now planning to break up the Food Corporation of India, the government company, to pave the way for the private sector to enter the foodgrain business.It's too early to say, but nothing has changed so far: the latest Consumer Price Index numbers show that food inflation in July increased to 9.36 per cent in July, against 8.05 per cent in June.The problem lies elsewhere. Over the last 10 or so years, India's food economy has seen a set of structural changes in farming, in agricultural produce marketing, and in demand itself. Some of these are reversible, others less so. These coexist with a set of short-term occurrences to create the complex outcomes that we see. To combat food inflation, it is these myriad factors the government needs to focus on.Something incredible happened to the cost of cultivation between 2009-10 and 2013-14. For example, the cost of growing paddy increased by an average of 17.6 per cent a year during this four-year period, against 4 per cent in the five-year period preceding that. Other crops too showed a similar spike (See graphic: Rising Input Prices are Putting Pressure on Output Prices).Three reasons why food prices have risen and could be here to stayCost of cultivation comprises many things. There's labour: human, machine and bullock. There's inputs: seeds, manure, fertilisers, pesticides, insecticides and irrigation. If the farming land is owned or the capital borrowed, there's rentals and interest. Just about every variable in that equation is seeing a strong  and concerted  upward pull.Take labour, which, according to Sen, accounts for about 30 per cent of the cost of cultivation. A discussion paper by Ashok Gulati, Surbhi Jain and Nidhi Satija, titled 'Rising Farm Wages in India: The 'Pull' and 'Push' Factors', on the CACP website shows that growth in farm wages rose, dipped and then sharply rose again.It grew at an ""almost uniform rate"" during the 1990s (around 3.7 per cent per year). Between 2001 and 2007, it fell by 1.8 per cent a year. Between 2007-08 and 2011-12, it grew 6.8 per cent a year, which is still less than the average rise in white-collar salaries and barely matches the rate of price rise. ""When we started work on this paper, we thought it was NREGA (National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), but it wasn't,"" says Gulati.The hypothesis is the ever-present NREGA option reduced the incentive for farm labourers to work in fields and increased their bargaining power. ""Wages were going up across the country, even in states where NREGA was not being implemented well,"" adds Gulati. Last week, RBI governor Raghuram Rajan confirmed this reading, and quantified the NREGA impact on rural wage increase at 10 per cent.Something else is going on. In the last 10-15 years, rural India has lost a large chunk of farmland to real estate and industry. This trend has also pulled labour.The 2001 census counted 107.5 million agricultural labourers. Sen, quoting NSS (National Sample Survey) data, says between 2004-05 and now, about 34 million people left primary employment in India. Of these, 20 million were women, most of whom dropped out of the workforce. Of the 14 million men, most seem to have moved into construction work. This decline naturally puts upward pressure on farm wages, more so in areas abutting these construction boom sites.Land transactions impact food inflation in another way. In most cases, says Sen, vegetables are grown near  up to 150km  large consumption centres like cities and towns. That's because vegetables are perishable and need an assured market nearby.However, with the property boom, agricultural land in this radius is leaving farm use. As distances between vegetable fields and cities grow, says Sen, the cost of accessing markets goes up. In areas where less fertile land is replacing fertile land lost, agriculture gets more input-intensive or yields smaller crops. Labour is not the only input to get costlier. In a paper titled 'Making Sense of Persistently High Inflation in India', published in the Economic & Political Weekly in October 2013, Sthanu R Nair observes light diesel oil prices grew 19 per cent between December 2009 and August 2013, electricity for farm use by 12.7 per cent and fertilisers by 9.7 per cent.These rates of increase are all well above, the paper says, ""the average headline inflation of 8.17 per cent in the same period"". This, adds Himanshu, an assistant professor of economics at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, is also contributing to inflation. ""Stability of input prices helps stabilise prices,"" he says.In a recent interview, food and public distribution minister Ram Vilas Paswan pinned the responsibility for the current instability in food prices on middlemen. Farmers can mostly sell their produce only to registered traders in primary mandis, which are governed by the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act  a model law whose jurisdiction lies with individual states.The bigger problem is the very construct of agricultural produce marketing. Most crops are grown in a few states and then dispatched countrywide. In each of these states, a handful of mandis handle most of the trade and set reference prices. In onions, for instance, most of the surplus comes from Maharashtra and Karnataka. And the reference mandis in Maharashtra are Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon.In the last five years or so, two significant processes have played out in these mandis, says Himanshu. One, local politicians have come to control them. For instance, the Nationalist Congress Party hovers over almost all mandis in western Maharashtra, along with other rural institutions. Two, fewer traders (both in mandis and in entire commodities) account for a greater chunk of trade.Three reasons why food prices have risen and could be here to stayA 2012 report commissioned by Geeta Gouri, member, Competition Commission of India (CCI), and prepared by researchers at Bangalore's Institute for Social and Economic Change, found rising volatility in onion prices. It found greater volatility in the wholesale market than in the retail market. And that the amplitude of this volatility was getting more pronounced from 2009 onwards.The study notes that the main onion mandis have very few traders. Further, most of the onion produce enters the mandis between October and February. This is when prices are highest. This suggests, according to the report, that ""other exogenous factors like hoarding, market cartels, etc are influencing onion prices"".The report showed the onion mandis don't allow new players to become traders, promoting cartelisation. An internal CCI note dated 10 April 2012 says that just one trader accounted for 7.2 per cent to 20.4 per cent of the onion trade in Lasalgaon mandi during December 2010, when onion prices climbed from Rs 35 to Rs 88 in just one week.As in onions, so elsewhere. An February 2014 EPW paper by Kannan Kasturi, titled 'Have Farmers Benefited from High Vegetable Prices in 2013?', says prices of vegetables are spiking only after the crop has left farmers and reached aggregators, who need not be mandi traders. Says G Chandrashekhar, an advisor to the government on agricultural commodities: ""If you look at rice, wheat, corn, cotton, sugar, the top five companies now account for 70 per cent of the business.""Numerous small processors, lacking economies of scale, used to supplant incomes through trading. However, the volatility is edging them out, Jigar Gala, a trader in tur and urad dal at Mumbai's APMC yard at Vashi, told ET in December 2013.Another reason, added Devendra Vora, another trader at the yard, is government policies. There are three types of licences: retail trade, food dealer or industry. ""Companies with these licences cannot keep a stock of over 300 tonnes,"" he says. ""However, a company with a corporate licence can hold up to 50,000 tonnes without any declaration. With a declaration, they can hold more."" The balance of power is, thus, increasingly tilting towards bigger playersFrom farms and mandis, the produce reaches consumers. The eating habits of Indians are changing. The more affluent are eating more proteins than carbs. Even the poor are moving from coarse cereals to finer ones like rice and wheat. But this is far from being the only process at work.As Ramesh Chand writes in 'Understanding the Nature and Causes of Food Inflation', published in EPW on 27 February, 2010, the share of exports in domestic production increased between 2003 and 2009. This, he says, was the main cause of the rise in food prices in 2008. In 2009, he adds, food prices stayed up not due to exports but because of poor rain.The current year throws up new problems. Sen says the raging inflation of the last two years is a mystery. ""The economy is down. So, construction is down, labour shortage is down, even the wage growth rate is down,"" he elaborates. ""Demand should have weakened. And with production continuing as before, inflation should have gone down, which did not happen.""According to Sen, one factor is the depreciation in the rupee, which makes imported fertiliser more expensive and also makes exports more attractive. In the last two years, agri exports, notably non-basmati rice and wheat, are up. Even this, Sen cautions, is only part of the larger narrative in inflation. ""It is not clear if the amount exported is enough to explain the jump we see in inflation,"" he says. ""Also, if you look at exports, it is true for rice and wheat, but not for vegetables.""The agriculture ministry can do little about currency movement. Or, weather patterns, which are unleashing floods and droughts more frequently in the country. India will keep encountering supply shocks from such changes.These can be addressed, says Chand, by either maintaining buffer stocks or by tapping international markets judiciously. However, he adds, beyond wheat and rice, ""there is no arrangement in the country to carry large inventories of other food items."" Nor, he writes, can the country always turn to global markets. ""The total trade in pulses is around 10 million tonnes, out of which India imports about 30 per cent.The global market doesn't seem to be having the capacity to meet India's rising demand for pulses."" At the same time, India's machinery of food imports and exports lacks ""swiftness and efficiency"", says Chand. For example, the first serious indications of a drop in sugarcane planting came by July 2008. Yet, sugar exports continued till March 2009, and in the first half of 2009-10, India had to import $306 million worth of sugar.Hard choicesBeing of a structural nature, a band-aid fix won't do in all three factors. Each needs a reformist intervention to bring about a change that is effective and enduring. And thus, by extension, each poses challenges and choices that involve tradeoffs.Between the rising cost of cultivation and the fact that an assured government offtake at a fixed price, called minimum support price, is available only for some crops, and that too only in some regions, farmers are facing uncertain incomes. Keeping them there means either offering them higher prices, but that stokes inflation. Or, it means dampening the price of agricultural inputs like fertiliser, oil and electricity, but that might take the form of higher subsidies.Loosening the hold of cartels is a straighter reform in one sense. But it has an element of politics ingrained in it  the political class has links and stakes with traders.The same is the case with showing better responsiveness on the trade front. All these are issues that cropped up under the UPA, but went wilfully unacknowledged. Will the NDA do better? Or has India entered a future of persistently rising food prices?"
456,Food companies push local flavours to up sales,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Food-companies-push-local-flavours-to-up-sales/articleshow/45580265.cms,2014-12-20,The Times Of India,"MUMBAI: How different can potato chips or a dhokla mix be from another of its kind? Well, the difference could define success or failure in a particular region of a nation as diverse as India, where local flavours rule consumer palates. Think macro and act micro is becoming the formula of success for most packaged food companies.A few years ago, when Gits Food Products (Gits) experimented with a very localized product called 'dhoka' in West Bengal, little did it realize that this Bengali delicacy would exceed sales of its nationally popular gulab jamun mix in the eastern state to become the number one product in the Gits' portfolio in that market. Can 'dhoka' click in another market as well? Unlikely. Basundi is another example with over 80% of Gits basundi mix sales coming from western states.Even ITC is crafting a strategy of creating regional flavours for potato chips and finger snacks. For example, 'Bingo! Tedhe Medhe' caters to the taste preferences of north India and 'Bingo! Galata Masti' has been introduced in the southern markets, while 'Bingo! Yumitos', an original style potato chips, has also been launched for the south.Undertaking extensive research at a micro level for a strategy riding on 'many Indias' is what marketers are keenly pursuing. ""Almost all of our research is done at a micro level,"" says Sahil Gilani, director (sales & marketing), Gits.""Gits dhoka mix was launched purely based on consumer demand and feedback from our sales team on the ground. Local retailers too were convinced that this product would work. Hence, we spent several months developing an authentic Bengali recipe for our dhoka mix,"" says Gilani. Research at ITC is also conducted at a micro level.""The attempt has been to expand the number of cities though it is a time-consuming and expensive exercise,"" said V L Rajesh, COO (foods division), ITC. ""Demand for various categories varies from region to region. For example, Sunfeast Marie and Sunfeast Dream Cream are primarily sold in the southern and western parts of India. SKUs (stock keeping units) for food brands also vary from state to state for the same flavour. Kerala sells more family packs than other states,"" said Rajesh.Marketers have, thus, begun to pay heed to even minute details of consumer behaviour. Even shifts towards new tastes are developing randomly. So Chinese as a sub-category is almost 10% of the sauces market in the south, according to consumer insights researched by Del Monte. ""There is a significant trend of people moving beyond local chutneys/condiments to schezwan and chilli sauces,"" said Yogesh Bellani, CEO, Field Fresh Foods (Del Monte).While south contributes 22% (year-to-date) to Del Monte's distributive trade business, the region's contribution to its Chinese business is 35%. Similarly, olive oil consumption is also said to be growing at an unprecedented rate in Punjab. There are many underlying factors  such as cardio-vascular diseases and exposure to relatives settled abroad  for Punjab to emerge as a big market for olive oil."

He was speaking at a function held to unveil the statute of veteran socialist and former union minister Upendra Nath Verma.Loss of power does not mean much to him as he made the sacrifice to uphold the principles of justice and harmony and would do it again and again if required as he regards unprincipled politics as nothing short of sin and deception, Nitish said.Lodging a complaint with the public, Nitish said the people have not paid him the wage for his hard work to bring about a turnaround in the state and hoped that in the coming days, the injustice done to him will be undone by the people. It was he who brought electricity and TV to the villages of the state by getting no less than 20,000 villages electrified but it backfired as the TV propaganda blitz of his political opponents reached the villages courtesy his electrification drive, he said.The former CM also said that his fight for special status for the state will continue till the goal was achieved and exhorted the naxalites to give up violence and join mainstream politics to bring about changes through peaceful means. Violence in the land of Buddha was an anachronism in itself, said Nitish."

As a result, the price of the tuber skyrocketed in the local markets.Hundreds of potato-laden trucks are stranded at Laxmannath check gate in Balasore district. ""The West Bengal government allowed free movement of potato trucks between August 17 and 23, but it has stopped it again. Movement of around 100 trucks of potato were cancelled by the neighbouring state,"" said president of Odisha Byabasayee Sangha Sudhakar Panda.Traders alleged that the West Bengal police have reportedly demanded money for releasing the trucks and beat up the drivers. ""A driver was assaulted and asked to pay Rs 20,000 bribe to police to cross the check gate at Laxmannath. Uncertainty in the business has also demoralized traders,"" Panda said, adding, ""The state government must seek Centre's intervention and put an end to the crisis.""Official sources said about 28,800 quintal of potato have reached the state in the last seven days. On Sunday, potato was selling at Rs 28 to Rs 35 a kg in retail markets against the wholesale rate of Rs 21 a kg.Food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma said the state has enough potato to meet the requirement for a month. Over 70,000 quintal and 40,000 quintal of potato have been kept in different cold storages of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack respectively, the minister said.""There is no reason to panic. We have discussed the matter with the West Bengal government and things will be resolved soon,"" he said.""It is strange that without any written notification the West Bengal government has been restricting supply of potato, which is an essential commodity,"" said secretary of Chhatrabazar Vegetable Vendors' Association Debendra Sahu.To overcome the crisis, the state government has formed a taskforce to chalk out a long-term plan. The taskforce will submit its report on production, preservation and distribution of potato within a month. Odisha has also tied up with International Potato Centre at Lima in Peru to improve potato production in the state.The state produces about 2.5 lakh metric tonne potato from 15, 000 hectare every year against the requirement of 9.86 metric tonne a year. To encourage potato cultivation the state government has been providing potato seeds at Rs 16 a kg and training farmers, sources said."

""These will come up near Berhampur and Sambalpur at an estimated cost of Rs 90 crore jointly funded by the state and the Centre,"" agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy said here on Sunday.He said more cold storages will come up in the state because farmers suffer for lack of proper markets and storage facilities, he said, while addressing a function to mark the 53rd Foundation Day of Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT).While 75% subsidy would be provided for setting up the multi-purpose cold storage in the KBK region, 60% subsidy has been declared for the same in coastal areas. The government is also contemplating to lower electricity tariff for cold storage, the minister said.He announced that the government would set up a second agriculture university in the KBK region this year and it will be named after Biju Patnaik.""We have provided Rs 2,727.99-crore for the agriculture sector in the 2014-15 budget. It is about 33% higher than last year,"" said finance minister Pradeep Amat, while addressing the function.Forest and environment minister Bikram Keshari Arukh stressed the need to increase produce of potatoes and onions in the state, so that Odisha does not need to depend on other states for ""the poor man's food"".This was the first time OUAT celebrated its foundation day outside the university campus.

They participated in the auctions after the state government issued stay of 15 days to MSMAB's Saturday order.Ranjan Lakhe, administrator of Kolhapur APMC, said, ""The auctions of vegetables, onions and potatoes began in the afternoon after we received the order from the state government.""The agricultural commodities from Kolhapur and neighbouring districts arrive at the APMC in the morning and the auction of these items starts immediately. The merchants purchase these commodities through commission agents. The agents charge the farmers commission for the deal that varies between 4% and 8% as per the commodity. There are around 375 commission agents active in Kolhapur APMC.""The activity at the APMC in Kolhapur was halted in the morning following the boycott by the commission agents. We had organised a meeting of the merchants and commission agents to find a way out but they were firm on their decision. The issue was sorted out after the state government's stay order,"" Lakhe said.""After we received the order on Monday afternoon, we immediately circulated it among the merchants and the commission agents and the trade resumed in the APMC,"" he said.Meanwhile, farmers' organisations and leaders said the state government took the decision under pressure from the merchants. Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raghunath Patil said, ""This is the third time that the state government has failed to stop the practice of charging commission from the farmers. Every time, the government succumbs to pressure of the merchants and middlemen and takes decisions against the farmers.""""The middlemen should not charge commission from the farmers for their produce as they are already paid less. Instead, they should take commission from the merchants who earn profit from buying commodities at cheaper rates and sell them at higher prices,"" he added."

At that time, it did not fetch good price as the fruit was not quite ripe and now the market is down due to a glut-like situation.The farmers, who embraced crop diversification about a decade ago, are once again mulling a switch to cultivation of maize or vegetables.The area under kinnow cultivation in the district has come down by nearly 500 hectares in the last couple of years. Lack of potential market has disheartened the farmers. For big farmers, there was a good market in Middle East countries but not anymore. Last year, a small consignment was sent to UK to test the waters but the farmers could not meet the specifications.Export from Pakistan has also adversely impacted the local growers. Medium and small farmers are hit the hardest as they lack the potential for exports. Domestic sale is their best bet.Malkit Singh, a farmer from Hariana, has reverted to maize cultivation as kinnow was not getting him good returns. Sohan Singh, another farmer of Pandori Sumla who is executive director of Citrus Estate Bhunga, has replaced his 16 acre kinnow field with potato and other vegetable crops.Initially, farmers reaped good profits but rising costs, plant diseases, weather fluctuations and above all limited market brought the profits down by several notches. This year, I cultivated three crops in place of kinnow and earned good income, said Sohan Singh.Horticulture development officer Jaspal Singh said it was disappointing to see farmers ditching a practice the department worked so hard to promote.It is indeed difficult to sustain farmers' interest in kinnow cultivation if they do not get adequate returns. At the end of the day, it is marketing that matters, he said.Farmers had high hopes from the multipurpose fruit and vegetable processing unit at Jahan Khelan but it failed to deliver. For many years after its installation in 2007, the plant remained almost out of use. Last year, it did function for a few days but since farmers were least hopeful, they had already sold most of the stock. This year the trial is complete and the plant is expected to mill around 2000 tonnes of Kinnow. ""We are processing the fruit for Hindustan Levers Ltd. Besides that we will process another 2000 tonnes for marketing at our own outlets"", said Punjab Agro Industries Corporation managing director Kahan Singh Pannu.Punjab horticulture director Gurkanwal Singh, who has been the nodal officer for citrus, agreed that there certainly was a need to explore newer markets. ""Once the low-grade fruit is consumed at the processing plant, prices of high-quality fruit would improve"", he claimed. ""At the newly established Indo-Israel Centre of Excellence at Khanaura village, we are developing techniques to enable farmers raise low cost, high-yield, disease-resistant varieties. An effective post-harvest management plan is also in the offing, he added."

Rawa laddoos are priced at Rs200/kg and besan ones at Rs250/kg, which were cheaper by at least Rs30/kg last year.Vegetable prices too have shot up this weak with potatoes priced at Rs40/kg from last week's Rs30 and beans at Rs60 from last week's Rs40. Cucumber costs Rs40 a kg from last week's Rs25.""Dishes like khatkhatem offered to god during the festival require a mix of vegetables, which are very expensive this year compared to last year. I bought potatoes last year for Rs16 a kg. It's better not to even think of how much the cost has shot up by,"" says Dipti Madkaiker from Bambolim. The upped pricing notwithstanding, she, as several other women, will still prepare the traditional dish, mix of vegetables, et al."
463,Hearty breakfast for everyone in Deolali,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/Hearty-breakfast-for-everyone-in-Deolali/articleshow/41041772.cms,2014-12-26,The Times Of India,"NASHIK: From a labourer in search of job for the day to a mother unable to find time to cook for tiffin for her children, everybody in Deolali knows where they can definitely get the morning breakfast.The Puri Bhaji Centre run by Maharaj Kishan Birmani, an industrialist and partner in Sivananda Electronics on Lam Road, feeds nearly 1,000 people daily. The Centre has been running successfully for the past 18 years, helping those looking for a bite at low or free cost. In the evening too, the centre prepares 150 packets of biryani.""We believe in only one thing. The person who steps out of home in the morning should have his stomach full. We give puri-bhaji packet to everyone who asks for it and whatever quantity they ask for, whether they pay or not,"" said Maharaj Birmani.The puri-bhaji packets cost Rs 6 but the price tag does not come in the way of giving them away to the needy. Labourers who do not find time to cook food, those with relatives admitted in hospitals or beggars are given food.The idea struck Birmani when he was feeding nearly 150 children on daily basis. ""We were taking care of 150 children, who were ill. We would fed them and gradually learnt that poor quality food was the cause of illness. This is how we started preparing the food for people,"" Brimani said.Birmani and his family members make arrangement in the early morning at the centre and starts distribution from 7 am till 10am daily. The children coming here are given a glass of milk, puri and biscuits free of cost.""We are proud to see some children, who ate the free breakfast in their childhood, and now return to the centre to pay for others and even donate. That's our achievement,"" he said.The centre has recently moved into a new premises. Every day, the team starts early with kneading the dough to make puris and the famous potato bhaji. ""We started with some people and now there are seven staff members engaged in preparing the steaming hot breakfast for our guests every morning. We also have started another centre at Nashik Road that offers 700 packets daily in the morning,"" Birmani said.The Rs 22,000 loss he suffers because of the charitable endeavour hardly hits him. The industrialist just wants prominent people in other cities to replicate their plan and ensure that people do not go hungry, at least in the morning.""The logic is simple. In Deolali we incur a loss of Rs 20 to 22 thousand per month, but we ensure that no one goes without food in the morning in the town. The same module can be applied by many known people across all the cities to ensure that the people do not go hungry ? at least in the morning,"" Brimani said."

To their sheer disappointment, the prices have now dropped to Rs 500-Rs 600 per quintal in the beginning of the harvesting season.Potato prices have suddenly dropped two months after the government put a ban on exporting the vegetable to other countries, except Pakistan, to control inflation.The government may have controlled potato prices but it never thinks about farmers who will suffer heavy losses, Kuldeep Singh Dhot, a farmer, said.Since the prices of potatoes were at peak at the time of sowing, farmers were forced to buy potato seeds at high rates.Dhot said farmers had to pay Rs 1700 for a 50-kg bag of potato seeds during the sowing season.He said including expenses such as seeds, irrigation, labour, pesticides and fuel, a farmer would have spent nothing less than Rs 80,000 per acre this season.The prices have now dropped to just Rs 550 per quintal. If a farmer has harvested 100 quintals of potato from one acre he will get only Rs 55,000 on the market and will face a minimum loss of Rs 25,000 per acre, said Dhot, who has cultivated potatoes on 400 acres.Harminder Singh, another farmer, said, The government should continue exporting potato to other countries as India produces a surplus crop.Ultimately, the potato glut in cold stores will get spoiled, he further said.Dr Manohar Singh, chief agriculture officer, Kapurthala, said, This is obvious that rates will be go down when the production of a crop increases and demand decreases. Same is the case with potato crop.He said the farmers should grow any crop in a limited quantity to get a good price for it.Despite our efforts, farmers are not taking crop diversification seriously and continue to stick to a limited crop cycle which leads to a glut-like situation, he said."

""Potato prices would have crossed Rs 30 a kg in our state had the government not stepped in.""Traders under the banner of the samiti met at the state's potato growing centres of Hooghly, Bankura, Burdwan and West Midnapore on Thursday and announced their decision to go on a three-day strike from September 1. ""It is better to shut shop than sell with these conditions. The price of other vegetables have risen six-seven fold. But there is no government intervention to check prices of these vegetables,"" said samiti state president Santanu Manna. Agricultural marketing minister Arup Ray said, ""I have called a meeting with potato traders on Friday to address their concerns. I hope we will be able to find a way out."""

And these products are not just cost-effective. Turns out, that the customers also find it to be a more convenient and hygienic substitute for fresh fruits and vegetables. Shop owners and customers across the city give us the reasons for making the switch.The rise in vegetable prices has led to middle income group families to switch over to ready-to-eat and frozen food and vegetables. Kumari Sadhana, a housewife who lives in Sector 3, tells us, ""It's simple maths, the cost of fresh apples is between Rs 150 and Rs 200 a kg. Fresh fruits are so expensive, so I buy packaged juices which cost me between Rs 20 and Rs 120, and the best part is one can just pour and drink whenever they want. Why would I buy fruits to prepare juice?"" Another customer, Rita Panigrahy, who lives in Sector 11, says, ""Packaged fruits and vegetables are such a relief. In my family, everybody prefers vegetable curry and no curry or gravy can be prepared without onions and ginger-garlic paste. But the price of these kitchen staples has crossed `160 per kg in the last one year. While the ready-to-use ginger-garlic paste costs us not more than Rs 30-40, and it can be used over a period of 10-15 days.""Shopkeepers also said that due to price rise of vegetables, the demand for their ready-to-use versions has shot up. ""Of late, we have had to increase our stock of ginger-garlic paste and tomato puree. These items sell so fast,"" says Harinder Singh, who owns a grocery store in Sector 56.""We have observed an increase in the sale of ginger-garlic paste by 40-50% in the last one year. And the sudden increase in the price of tomatoes has doubled the demand of tomato puree also. Last month, in just one week, I had to order the stock for tomato puree thrice from the wholesale market. Now, I order these items also in bulk. And since the vegetable prices don't seem to be coming down any time soon, it will remain the hottest selling item,"" says Harinder. ""Peas, cauliflower, sweet corn and even meat are on the top of the list of the frozen food items. When the price of a particular vegetable rises, the demand for its frozen version increases. Obviously, people want to cut the cost. Another reason is time. Since nobody shops for vegetables daily, they are not able to get fresh veggies and doing a big weekly shopping often results in the fresh vegetables going to waste. That's the reason why demands for frozen vegetables is increasing, especially in double income families,"" says Karan Mehta, a grocery shop owner in Sector 44.The demand for packaged has also increased with a variety of companies offering dairy products and frozen foods. ""The demand of frozen veggies and fruits has increased because convenience has become a big driver for people,"" says Gunjan Kumar, who works at a Mother Dairy outlet. There has been a thaw in the way consumers of Noida are buying frozen food. ""With the rising prices, the 'coming home to a frozen meal' proposition appeals to the customers. Frozen peas, corn, baby corn are so common that people have forgotten that these are sold otherwise also. In fact, we have found that consumers' preference for frozen non-vegetarian items is also rising because of hygiene issues,"" says Prerna Tripathi*, an attendant at the Food Bazaar in GIP.Pankaj Mittal, a content writer, who lives in Jalvayu Vihar, tells us, ""Frozen vegetables make life so much easier. I am staying with my three roommates, and as eating out daily is not possible, we have to cook. None of us know which quality of potatoes is better, whether or not the vegetable vendor is fooling us, are the vegetables rotten from inside etc. And after coming back from office, none of us have the energy to argue for two-three rupees. At least with frozen veggies, we are sure about the quality, plus it costs us less and takes less time to cook."" Anuradha Sarin, an HR executive, says, ""People like me, who can't eat out daily and don't know how to cook, survive on these ready-to-cook meals. From biryani to parathas, whatever I want, I can cook and eat. If I buy a packet of biryani, I can have it for three meals, but if I want to prepare it all by myself, the ingredients will not cost less than Rs 200. Yeh option sasta bhi hai aur convenient bhi. Even the peas or paneer are less costly than what we get in open market.""""Customers buy processed food because the packaging appeals to them enough to prompt them to buy the product. Even though their taste or texture is not at par with fresh vegetables, just because it is easy to prepare and less time consuming, people are buying it,"" says Kumar Vinod, manager of a Safal outlet near Ganga complex.Malik Kumar, who owns a grocery shop in Sector 12, says, ""In the last couple of months, I have seen a rise in the sale of ready-to-eat products such as aloo methi, palak paneer, navratan korma, etc. Earlier, only young customers used to ask for these products, but now, housewives are also buying them in bulk. Then there are customers who may not buy packaged aloo parathas, but they prefer ready-to-eat cutlets, tikkis, etc. These items are priced appropriately to suit the middle-class pocket and companies give offers like buy one, get one free."" Shyamali Bajpayee, a resident of Sector 12, says, ""My children don't eat without side dishes like cheese nuggets or fries. Besides, it is cheaper also. If I make these frozen French fries at home, it costs me less than buying them from McDonalds or KFC, and saves me the trouble of making it at home."""

In the last three days, only 35 truckloads of potato have reached Odisha from West Bengal.""We have no problem in selling potato to Odisha or any other state, but the state government has imposed a ban for reasons best known to it,"" vice-president of West Bengal Progressive Potato Merchants' Association Barun Pandit told TOI.""Now chief minister Mamata Banerjee has also made a precondition that if we sell 300 Metric Tonne (MT) to the state government at a lower price then only she will allow us to sell 700 MT to other states,"" Pandit said.West Bengal government has been imposing undeclared restriction on potato supply to Odisha from time to time, leading to severe shortage and spiralling prices.Everyday, around 400 tonnes of potato come from West Bengal to Odisha through Laxmannath check gate at Jaleswar, 65 km from Balasore. Odisha market mainly depends on Bardhaman, Chandrakana and Belda potato mandis of West Bengal.Earlier many potato trucks sneaked into Odisha through other check gates following the restrictions. But that will not be possible this time as the West Bengal government has decided to install CCTV cameras along the border to keep an eye on potato trucks going outside the state,"" said potato trader of West Bengal Biren Mandal.It is high time the state government sought intervention of the Centre to find a permanent solution to the crisis. Due to the frequent uncertainty, a large number of potato traders in the state have decided to quit the business, said president of Odisha Byabasayee Sangha Sudhakar Panda.""A state cannot restrict supply of essential commodity to another state without any notice or reason,"" said Panda."

But after 1990s, farmers moved on to other crops, agriculture field officer Resham Singh said.He said after 2002, farmers in the district have been avoiding cultivating the crop altogether.In the neighbouring Hoshiarpur, the crop was sown on 1,600 hectares in 2011-2012, which has now come down to 1,300 hectares in 2013-2014.Sangrur and Ludhiana were on the top of the list among districts in groundnut production in the 1980s, as the crop was cultivated over 15,000 hectares and 7,000 hectares, respectively. These districts too fare bad when it comes to groundnut cultivation presently.In 2010-2011, groundnut was cultivated only on 2,200 hectares in the entire state, while the figure was 43,000 hectares during the 1980s. At present, the state imports groundnut from states such as Gujarat and Maharashtra, resulting in an increase in prices of peanut.Harvinder Singh, a farmer, said they cultivated the crop during the 2000s but later they shifted to growing potatoes.If the government starts providing subsidy for groundnut seeds, farmers may again start cultivating the crop, he said.Dr Manohar Singh, district agriculture officer, Kapurthala, said, The government is making efforts to promote crop diversification among farmers and motivating them to cultivate crops which need less water to save groundwater."

Besides, it will provide potato seeds at a reasonable price to produce more potato seeds and use catchment areas for potato cultivation.""The government is taking steps to make the state self-sufficient in potato within three years. For this, we need to popularize the potato programme among farmers. They are being sensitized through various activities,"" said director of horticulture Sanjib Chadha.Sources said Odisha produces about 2.5 lakh metric tonne potato on 15,000 hectares area every year, against the requirement of 9.86 lakh metric tonnes. The tuber is mainly cultivated mainly in Cuttack, Puri, Kandhamal, Balasore, Sambalpur and Koraput districts.""Not many farmers are trying potato cultivation because of lack of storage facility. This year, we have decided to increase potato cultivation from 15,000 to 20,000 hectares. We are expecting to produce at least 3.5 lakh MT this rabi season,"" said assistant horticulture officer Susant Das.The directorate has decided to form potato producers' groups for both ware potato and seed potato production.

Steps are also being taken for modernization of existing cold storages.""Emphasis will be given on using catchment areas of borewells, lift irrigation points and other irrigation sources. Several new areas for potato cultivation have also been identified in districts like Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Koraput and Rayagada,"" Dash said. On Monday, partners for agri communities and Tribal (PACT) has submitted a separate proposal to produce five lakh MT of potato in Koraput district through small, marginal and tribal farmers by end of 2015 Rabi season.

But by all accounts the government has managed the situation effectively  at least so far. A scan of the wholesale price index shows barring vegetables, which have shot up 41% between May and July, food inflation has remained under control. In vegetables, the main drivers have been brinjal (60%), onion (58%) and bhindi (56%).The price rise of pulses (1.3%), cereals (1.6%) and milk (1.8%) has been moderate during these months. In fact, egg prices have fallen. Meat and fish that had shot up because of a demand spike, witnessed a 4.5% decline.Fruits and vegetables are the only sore point and finance minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday conceded there's little the government can do. But even here, the government reined in inflationary expectations through a series of decisive steps.""By liquidating FCI stocks, the government has done in two months what UPA couldn't in two years. Plus, he has resisted pressure from allies in significantly raising the minimum support price, ""agriculture economist Ashok Gulati said. Experts reckon there are no short-term fixes to keep fruit and vegetable prices under check. Typically, there are sharp spikes because of seasonal changes.The jury is still out on onions given that there may be pressure on prices in late September and early October when the fresh crop hits the market. But going by the experience on onions, import duty cuts to deal with shortages is seen as a short-term solution. After all, chicken legs attract 100% import duty, potatoes and tomatoes face a 30% levy. To protect local farmers, imported apples attract 50% duty, while customs duty on skimmed milk powder remains at 60%."
