The entry of field beans (avarekai) into the market and their sale in huge quantities has lessened the demand for other vegetables, thus reducing their prices, say traders.Prices of most vegetables, barring the peas, are presently between Rs 10 and Rs 30 a kg at wholesale markets, the traders said.Speaking to Deccan Herald, R V Gopi, president of the Vegetable and Fruit Wholesale Merchants Association, said, Among the vegetables, the prices of beans have decreased the most from Rs 35Rs 40 a kg last week to Rs 15-Rs 20 this week.Tomatoes and potatoes are being sold at wholesale vegetable markets at prices between Rs 10 and Rs 20 per kg. There is a reduction in the vegetable prices by 40 per cent.He said that at least till Makara Sankranti that falls on January 15 this year, the demand for field beans will be higher than that for other vegetables.Traders in Kalasipalyam said that the market had been receiving more than 200 tonnes of field beans every day since January first week. Sources in Hopcoms pointed out that compared to the corresponding month last year, the prices of field beans are much cheaper this time.The production of field beans is high, making them available at cheaper rates. However, farmers growing other vegetables are facing losses, an official from Hopcoms said.Meanwhile, the prices of basic kitchen ingredients such as ginger and garlic remain unchanged and are being sold at Rs 70 to Rs 100 per kg respectively.The prices of green chillies have come down from Rs 75 per kg to Rs 60. The prices of coriander leaves have reduced by 20 per cent, said Shankar Gowda, a wholesale vegetable trader from Girinagar."

Traders attribute it to increase in supply and farmers say that the output has gone up because of favorable weather conditions.Earlier this week, prices of tomato and certain green vegetables had shot up because of unseasonal rains. Prices of vegetables including spinach, fenugreek, cucumber, tomato and many other seasonal vegetables have now come down by about 20%. While tomato prices have come down from Rs 30 per kg to Rs 20 per kg, onion and potato prices have also come down marginally in the past two to three days.""The supply has increased and prices have come down even though demand continues to be high due to marriage season,"" wholesale trader Vinod Kumar told Hindustan Times.""Harvesting of vegetables like spinach and fenugreek (methi) is in full swing and so there has been a steep fall in the prices of green leafy vegetables. This will put pressure on prices of other vegetables,"" Kumar said.Agriculture experts have now stressed upon increase in government expenditure on improving the infrastructure to raise the farm output and also take steps to enhance the storage and handling capacity. The key reform, say experts, is changing the dynamics of handling (transportation) and storage and also parameters of vegetable production to increase production capacity.""Shrinkage in area under vegetable cultivation has also become a matter of concern as villages near the urban areas are giving way to townships,"" said agriculture expert Samar Singh.The onus, say experts, is on the government to make agriculture more profitable for farmers to stop selling the fertile land."

Pakistan is the largest market for Indian potatoes during the first half of this fiscal (April-October).The farmers who were already facing losses to the tune of Rs 20,000 per acre due to a fall in prices from Rs 1,600 to Rs 600 per quintal, would now have to bear losses of Rs 30,000 per acre.The situation is exacerbated by the fact that farmers were forced to buy potato seeds at high rates as at that time the price of potato was at a peak.Kuldeep Singh, a farmer said that he had paid Rs 1,700 for a 50-kg bag of potato seeds during the sowing season. He said that including expenses such as seeds, irrigation, labour, pesticides and fuel, a farmer would have spent nothing less than Rs 80,000 per acre this season.""The prices have now dropped to just Rs 400 per quintal. If a farmer has harvested 100 quintals of potato from one acre, he will get only Rs 45,000 in the market and will face a minimum loss of Rs 30,000 per acre,"" said Dhot, who has cultivated potatoes on 400 acres.Resham Singh Chandi, vice-president, potato grower association Kapurthala, blamed the government for this situation and said that if the government had not put a ban on the export of potatoes the farmers would have got good prices of their hard-work.""If the apathetic government still fails to give attention to the issue, the price of the crop may drop further in coming days and the farmers would not be able to bear the losses then,"" he said.Meanwhile, supervisor of vegetable market, Sukhdev Singh said that the fall in prices was due to the increased harvest. ""It is obvious that the rates will be go down when the production of the crop increases and demand decreases,"" he said.Despite repeated attempts, Dr Manohar Singh, chief agriculture officer, Kapurthala, could not be reached for comments."

Vendors put it down to over production due to timely rains. L Duraipandi, who has a shop in the Central market, said that a box of 15 kg had been rated at about 150 last month, but today it went down to 80.However, retailers in other parts of Madurai maintained the price at around 10.

29,29,"Potato stock bar lifts, price woe stays",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150221/jsp/bengal/story_4711.jsp,2015-02-21,Telegraph,"Price problem Calcutta, Feb. 20: The Mamata Banerjee government has decided to withdraw an order issued last year imposing a ban on stocking more than 2,000 tonnes of potato by an individual after farmers started lodging complaints that they were not getting a good price for their produce this year. The move, senior government officials said, showed that the state government's intervention in the market for the past two years to keep the price of the tuber under control had caused trouble to consumers and farmers. According to Nabanna officials, farmers who have already harvested the new potato are being forced to sell their produce at Rs 4 a kg these days, lower than last year, when it sold for Rs 7 to Rs 8 a kg. The control order was issued last year, when the price of potato had shot up to Rs 22 a kg, to ensure that nobody could hoard to create an artificial crisis. ""But the order has now become a barrier for farmers. The order was withdrawn a few days ago,"" said a senior Nabanna official. Agriculture department officials explained that traders were not showing interest in procuring potato from farmers as they thought they could face trouble if they stocked more than 2,000 tonnes. The lack of buyers forced the farmers to sell their produce at a much lower price. The Bengal government had fixed a maximum retail price for the tuber for the past two years - Rs 14 and Rs 16 a kg, respectively. The state had also fixed a maximum storage limit for an individual and issued a blanket ban on export. ""The intervention caused a severe damage to the entire system,"" said a city-based industrialist, who is associated with agro-business and potato products. He said the government tried to play with the demand and supply rule that determines the price of a commodity. ""The price of potato remained at Rs 24 a kg for the major part of last year as the traders created an artificial crisis in the market by holding back their stock in the cold stores."" A section of traders said despite the withdrawal of the control order, they are apprehensive of buying a large stock from the farmers. ""For the past two years, the government had issued a blanket ban on export and we incurred losses... We are not sure whether there will be a ban this year too,"" said a potato trader. Senior government officials said that in order to give some relief to the farmers, the state government could have procured some potato at a better price. ""This could have helped the farmers and the consumers too as the govern-ment could have released the stock in the market whenever price of the produce goes up in the market,"" said an official. But the finance department has rejected a proposal on this. ""The agriculture marketing department had sought a sum of Rs 100 crore to initiate the scheme... But the finance department rejected it,"" said a senior government official adding that such a scheme would have been helpful, instead of imposing a ban on export."

A similar situation has arisen this year following a bumper potato harvest.The wholesale price in Deesa crashed to an all-time low after 2011. Despite 50kg bag of potato being priced at Rs 250 (Rs 5/kg) buyers were hard to find. Earlier, a 50kg bag was sold at Rs 600-700. ""We are facing tough time thanks to the bumper crop. Unseasonal rain too has harmed the potato farmers. Even Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, two chief potato producing states, are facing similar problems,"" said a leading farmer Odhaji Thakore.Adding to farmers' woes are the cold storage owners who have hiked rent by Rs 12.50 per 50kg bag. Mounds of potatoes can be seen lying in open fields with no space in cold storage facilities.""We are prepared to off load the stock but there are no buyers,"" lamented Thakore, adding that the government was not paying attention to their woes. ""Our main demand is better prices, freight-free transportation and scrapping of hike in cold storage rates,"" Thakore added. District collector Banaskantha, Dilip Rana, said, ""We are doing our best to deal with the situation. With regards to reduction of cold storage rates I will talk to the owners.""Thakore said, ""If the government fails to provide freight subsidy to transport potatoes to other states in the next few days, we will have to do what we did in 2011 - dump the potatoes on roads."" R M Patel a researcher at Sardar Krushinagar Dantiwada University, said, ""Bumper crop is big problem,"" adding, ""As against last year's 45,000 hectare, this year sowing was done in 52,000 hectare. The rates have fallen sharply,"" he said.There are 118 cold storages in Banaskantha with total capacity of 1.85 crore bags of 50kg. However, output this year is 2.75 crore bags. Combined capacity of clod storages in the state was 3.50 crore bags while total potato production according to the state government estimate was likely to go up to six crore bags, said president of Deesa Cold Storage Owners' Association (CSOA) Ganpat Kachwah."
44,44,Tragedy bares potato worry,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150311/jsp/bengal/story_8006.jsp,2015-03-11,Telegraph,"March 10: Two potato farmers allegedly committed suicide in Burdwan and Hooghly last night after failing to sell the bulk of their produce and secure a good price for the portion they could. While Guddu Murmu, who cultivated potato on a little over two acres in Burdwan's Bhatar, allegedly consumed pesticide, farmer Swapan Kundu hanged himself from a tree near his home in Hooghly's Khanakul. Murmu's family said he had taken a loan of Rs 50,000 and failed to sell even one-fourths of the 2,800kg of potato he produced. According to Kundu's wife, the Hooghly farmer had taken a loan of nearly Rs 1 lakh from a local cooperative. He was forced to sell 1,600kg of potato at Rs 3.20 a kg, much lower than the amount required to cultivate a kilo of the crop. Agriculture department officials said traders had been avoiding buying potato in bulk ever since a government ban on its export two years ago. Although the ban has been partially revoked, the traders are wary of the curb being imposed again. The situation has come to such a pass that farmers are being forced to sell potato at Rs 3 a kg in the majority of the areas. ""Farmers spend around Rs 4 to produce a kilo of potato.... Selling the produce at Rs 3 a kg would mean a lot of trouble for small and marginal farmers,"" an official said. Most small and marginal potato farmers in Bengal take loans from local moneylenders to buy seeds and fertilisers. This prevents them from storing the crop for long and waiting for the prices to rise because that would involve having to pay a higher interest for the loan. The Mamata Banerjee government has decided to buy 50,000 tonnes of potato directly from farmers and allow the export of 2 lakh tonnes. Agriculture department officials described the relief as ""too little"". Asked about the twin suicides, agriculture minister Purnendu Bose said: ""I won't be able to comment at this moment. I am yet to get a report on them."""

The distress caused by the abundant yield this year is evident, as farmers who used to sell potatoes directly from the fields are now forced to take the produce home. The bumper crop, coupled with weak demand from other States, has led to a free-fall in prices in West Bengal.Murmu, who was in his late fifties, had taken a loan of Rs. 50,000 from local moneylenders to cultivate potato in about five bighas (around two acres) of land as a sharecropper. He was shattered when the prices crashed and he killed himself by consuming pesticide on Monday.Buddhadeb Ansh, a local farm trader and money lender from the adjoining Ramchandrapur village, arrived at Murmus house on Wednesday and said the farmer had borrowed Rs 5,000 from him also.Last year the farmers sold potatoes at Rs. 350 to Rs. 400 per sack of 50 kilograms. This year, the prices have dropped below Rs. 150. In many cases, there are no takers even at lower prices, said Ansh,Murmu had to support a family of ten that includes his wife, three sons, daughters-in-law and grand children. His wife Kalamani has locked herself inside the thatched house at Chatimdanga village and refuses to speak.All the potatoes are lying in the fields, said Ram Murmu, Guddu Murmus son. The store [cold storage] is not taking potatoes any more. We do not know how we will survive.A few hundred metres away from Murmus home, another farmer Mukul Singh is busy harvesting from his field. Now we will also have to commit suicide, he said. Last year, I produced 150 sacks of potatoes in the two bighas of land that I cultivated and sold them at more than Rs. 350 per sack. This year the produce is higher but the prices are much lower, he said.Government denialSenior government functionaries meanwhile claim that Murmus family owns several bighas of land in the village and that his sons are employed outside the State. However, according to the family members and neighbours, Murmu did not own any land and all his sons were farmers in the village.States Agriculture Minister Purnendu Bose denied that the suicide had anything to do with the potato crisis but admitted there was distress selling by farmers. He said the government was buying potatoes for the mid-day meal and the ICDS projects and was in the process of lifting restrictions on sale to other States.Potato production this year has increased from 90 lakh tonnes to 1.10 crore tonnes. The cold storages in the State can hold not more than 74 lakh tonnes.The government is in the process of lifting restrictions on sale to other States"

He died at Burdwan Medical College Hospital on Friday morning, police said.The victims brother Bansi said the farmer had mortgaged his wifes ornaments to arrange for a private loan of Rs 60,000.

So far, 17 potato farmers suicides have been reported in Bengal.In 2013, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had imposed restrictions on export of potato to other States to curb its rising price in Bengal, which continued for one-and-a-half years. These restrictions were however eased last year.Encouraged by the profit gained from potato farming last year, farmers had sown potato in more than 4 lakh hectares of land.The chairperson of the Pradeshik Krishak Sabha, the peasant wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Madan Ghosh said that the West Bengal Governments decision to restrict the export of potato to neighbouring States left them with no choice but to increase their own yield of potato.As a result, traders from other States lost interest in importing potato from West Bengal and our farmers lost an essential means to sell their crop, he told The Hindu here on Sunday.Mr. Ghosh said that the potato production this year had crossed 1 crore tonne compared to the normal yield of 90 lakh tonne. So the State governments decision to purchase 50,000 metric tonne directly from farmers is grossly inadequate, he said, adding the States cold storages maximum capacity was only 65 lakh tonne.Speaking in the same vein, professor of Economics and Rural Development in Vidyasagar University Sebak Kumar Jana said that the decision to ban export of potato was not financially logical. If there was adequate infrastructure to set up more cold storages, such a loss to farmers could have been avoided, he added.Professor of Economics at Jadavpur University Joyashree Roy, however, said that to associate potato farmers suicide directly the with low price of the crop would be scientifically justified.Mr. Basu, however said that the restriction on potato export was imposed to prevent large-scale shortage of the crop in Bengal as it was illegally exported to Uttar Pradesh, which had low crop production in 2013. So, it was a positive step by the State Government that prevented the acute shortage of potato in West Bengal, he told The Hindu .Mr. Basu said that some dishonest potato traders were also responsible for the present crisis as they were not buying potatoes from farmers to pressurise the State Government for their vested interests.The restriction was imposed to prevent shortage of the crop in Bengal as it was illegally exported to U.P.Purnendu BasuBengal Agriculture Minister"

Farmers are forced to sell potato at around Rs 2 per kg, but consumers have been paying Rs 10 per kg for potatoes in the market. In this way, the middlemen are making more than the farmers.The huge difference of Rs 8 per kg has been only exposing the poor policies of the state and central government towards farmers.The Punjab government is encouraging farmers to adopt crop diversification to replace the wheat-paddy pattern and the potato crop is a major alternative to wheat, but right now, potato farming is turning a losing proposition for farmers.Potatoes were sold on Friday at the rate of Rs 80 to Rs 110 per 50 kg bag in the Bathinda market by farmers to commission agents and retailers. Besides, the price of potato for the consumer is still Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg. Harsimran Singh, a wholesale vegetable merchant, said that potato price rose on Friday, it had been sold only at Rs 38-40 per bag a few days earlier.The area under the crop and yield of the crop has increased here. The area increased to 6,000 hectares this year from 5,700 hectares during the last year and the yield has increased from 85-85 quintals to 113-120 quintals per acre.In Bathinda district, potatoes have been sown mainly in Rampura Phul and Goniana area. Farmers of these areas are complaining for low rates and lack of governmental subsidies and marketing policies.Gurcharan Singh, a potato farmer, said that he has been growing potato crop for the last twenty years, but now he is thinking to go back to the traditional paddy-wheat crops. He said, ""We had spent more than Rs 30,000 per acre on the crop and now we getting only Rs 18000 to Rs 25,000 per acre. How can we survive with this?""Buta Singh of Nahiya Wala village said, ""No cold store is free in the district to keep potatoes, as the wholesalers had booked the stores in advance. Cold store owners are demanding higher charges for storage. We are helpless to send our product to farther cities for storage. Merchants are robbing us.""In the market, 10% commission is charged from sellers, and the market fee is extra. The retail merchants are selling potatoes at the rate of Rs 8-10 per kg.The government did not fix any minimum support price (MSP) for the purchase of potato crop and no government agency bys the crop.

The increase in prices has been attributed to continuous heat waves in both the Telangana and the Andhra Pradesh since the production of most of the vegetables came down.Due to lack of refrigerated transport facilities, the vegetables were also being wasted during the transportation with prevailing heat conditions.The traders in the market said that the sudden spurt in the prices of some vegetables was just an indication that the tough days are ahead.Unless the monsoon arrives early, the traders said that the prices would go up further within no time.Burden on familiesSpeaking to The Hindu , a housewife P.

Food inflation stood at 3.8 per cent, lower than the previous few months but prices of pulses shot up 22.84 per cent in May from 15.38 per cent in April.Vegetable inflation too fell at -5.5 per cent, with potato prices easing by about 52 per cent but onions jumped over 20 per cent. Inflation in manufactured goods such as sugar, edible oils and beverages declined by 0.64 per cent, lowest in the past many months.To tame spiralling prices of pulses, the government has said it is open to importing pulses if the need arises.Prices of pulses have risen sharply in the last one year as the domestic production fell by nearly two million tonnes in 2014-15, crop year due to unfavourable weather conditions.India Inc lauded the fall in prices but asked the government to invigorate the supply-side response to tackle any adverse impact of the monsoon.Assocham said that the continuous downtrend in WPI seen over the past few months is a positive signal towards stabilisation of prices and this should surely help in further boosting economic activity. It said, however, that a constant decline in the figures raises concerns, especially for the manufacturing sector.DH News Service"

Potato rates are at an all-time low, thanks to a major glut in Uttar Pradesh  the main production centre in country. Potatoes are in the range of Rs 12-15 a kg in the retail markets, which is one-fourth of last year's levels.Unseasonal rains in various pockets of the country during May hit the onion-growing regions hard.

Farmers across Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan are getting only Rs 4-6 per kg for potato and tomato growers are getting only Rs 9 per kg in Bangalore.Sources said that the agriculture ministry has carried out an assessment of the falling potato and tomato prices to project how farmers are in a state of distress.

Even in Jaipur, prices are around Rs 4.20 per kg.Agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain said that the solution to both exceptional price rise and unsustainable crash in prices lies in creating a national agriculture market where all farm produce can cross states without any barriers."

However, this time it has fallen to Rs 600. At Kanthallur, it has been certified by the Kerala Agriculture University that no harmful pesticides were found in the vegetables. The main items are potato, carrot, beetroot, beans and garlic.The Agriculture Department under the Integrated Tribal Development Scheme had selected two tribal villages of Mangaparakudy and Vallavayalkudy for vegetable cultivation. Eighty-five hectares of land were brought under vegetable cultivation with nearly 50 hectares being potato. The harvesting of the potato started on Monday in these settlements. As it was aimed at initiating the tribal people into vegetable cultivation, the fall in the prices could make them retract from vegetable farming, the official said adding that in the coming days there are chances of further decline in the prices when the major portion starts arriving in the market. In Vattavada alone, of the 2,927 hectares total vegetable cultivation around 990 hectares is for potato.This time the production is average and newly cultivated areas could make a better harvest, said P.T.

263,263,Dip in potato price robs the puja sheen in Hooghly,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Dip-in-potato-price-robs-the-puja-sheen-in-Hooghly/articleshow/49460578.cms,2015-10-20,The Times Of India,"HOOGHLY: The farmers are selling potatoes at Rs 3 per kg in Tarakeswar, Pursura and Arambagh, but people in Kolkata are buying the same potatoes at Rs 10 (Jyoti variety) and Rs 14-16 (Chandramukhi variety). The sudden dip in price of potatoes has robbed the sheen of the festive spirit in the vast rural belt of Hooghly, which thrives on potato economy.Along with dipping potato price, the uncertainty also looms large with industries of Hooghly. On Monday, a wife of a worker of closed down jute mill committed suicide on a day when the jute mill reopened after suspension work for six months. Rakhi Mohanti, 21, wife of Shankar Mohanti, a worker of drawing department of Victoria Jute Mill, committed suicide apparently for not being able to withstand the acute poverty.While other jute mills are functioning, but workers alleged an ill-payment. While in Bihar an average labourer gets Rs 300 per day, a jute mill worker gets Rs 165 per day. ""What puja are you talking about babu, when we are losing our sleep over two square of meal,"" said Raghunath Pansari, a jute mill worker in Bansberia.Two of major sources of jobs - Hindustan Motor and Dunlop - have perpetuated the nightmare. While one has shut its shop down, other exists only symbolically. Dunlop has not had any production since its reopening a year ago. The workers gets a token salary of Rs 5,000 per month. Moreover, the factory authority has recently informed a major theft from the plant, making the possibility of any production in near future impossible.Against this back-drop, Hooghly, the biggest producer of potatoes in the state, banked on potato price. Last year, potato -growers got its price, thanks to skyrocketing price. But this year, there is no sign of such rise of price. But the fall of potato price to Rs 3 per kg has robbed farmers of their last hope. ""We grow to lose. Last year, we made distress sale after good production. Middlemen took the profit home. This year, we hoarded expecting a price to rise, but now potato price is steadily dipping,"" said Balaram Ghosh, a farmer of Tarakeswar.But the price farmer gets is unlikely to reflect in selling price at urban centres, where the potatoes reaches via many hands of middle-men. ""The 'ready aloo' (sorted and coloured potatoes) is priced at Rs 260 per bag of 50 kg at the cold-storages. Per kg of potatoes is priced at Rs 5.2. But the same potatoes is selling at Rs 10 - 12 per kg. Just imagine how the middlemen taking away all the cream,"" said Gautam Das, another retailer at Pursura."
