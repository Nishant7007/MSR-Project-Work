As compared to early December, prices of some vegetables have fallen as much as 30-40%.Vegetables in abundant supply include ladys finger, capsicum, cabbage, potato and green peas causing their prices to drop drastically.Avinash Patil, deputy secretary, APMC market said, The number of vehicles with vegetables, arriving at the market has increased substantially. While in December about 450 to 475 vehicles came to the market every day, this figure stands between 550 and 575.Patil added, This excess supply has forced prices to come fall and this trend is expected to continue in February as well.To explain the situation better, Patil used the example of green peas. Green peas grow in abundance in winter, providing fresh and affordable stock for consumers. There are 60-65 vehicles of green peas that arrive at the market from Jabalpur, other parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh every day. This has lowered the current price of green peas to Rs. 16-20 a kg in the wholesale market, and Rs. 25 a kg in retail market.Pradeep Gupta, a vegetable vendor at sector 9 market, Vashi said, Owing to favourable vegetables do not perish quickly and hence wastage is lesser.Gupta added, Festivals, such as makar sankranti, do affect prices but it is a temporary rise. On the whole, prices have seen a decline and should continue for a month.Residents are pleased at having to shell out lesser. Sadhana Hampras, Kopar Khairane resident said, With the steady rise on cost of living thanks to spiralling inflation, this fall in vegetable prices will provide much-needed respite to the common man."

Our vegetable suppliers have been with us for decades and there has been no change in supply due to the price hike. Neither have we reduced the use of onions in the restaurant.""""The Lalit Ashok is a food and beverage-centric hotel and we definitely won't compromise on quality. Our food prices remain the same as we believe the onion price rise is transitory,"" said Amit Samson, general manager, Lalit Ashok.But the not-so-big players are tweaking their recipes.""There are certain North Indian gravies where we cannot reduce onion usage because that changes their taste completely. But there are some dishes in which we can cut down on onions, like onion dosa or utthappam, or the potato filling in masala dosa. Many hotels are now using 25% onions and 75% potato mash for dosa filling. Even in chaats, the use of onions can be reduced,"" explained K Ramamurthy, secretary, Bruhat Bangalore Hotels' Association (BBHA).""The hotel industry is hit first when it comes to price rise. If prices go up, people cut down on eating out. Bachelors have no choice but to eat in small hotels,"" he added.But smaller hotels and chains which have been opening outlets across the city admit they've been hit hard. ""Smaller hotels have no choice but to tweak the taste of food by reducing onion use, or stop making dishes where onions are a must. Those who planned to open new outlets are waiting until the market stabilizes,"" Ramamurthy added.While big hotels and restaurants will ride out the highs, small hotels could perish if this continues. There are about 1,500 small, big and medium hotels in the city under the BBHA banner, he added."

""It has virtually disappeared from the plates of poor and middle class people,"" says Mita Sharat, a housewife in Purnia.It is not only the price of onion which has sky-rocketed, prices of vegetables of all kinds have soared sky high. Parwal (pointed gourd) too has gone beyond Rs 35 per kg while bitter gourd sells at Rs 40. Even raddish and lady's finger pinch pocket and sells at Rs 35 to Rs 40 per kg.""There is absolutely no market mechanism and any kind of administrative control on the prices,"" tells Renu Gami in Katihar. ""How many things you give a miss,"" quips a college lecturer Meena Kumari in Kishanganj. Only potatoes are cheap and sells at Rs 10 per kg.Milk, which was selling at Rs 30 per kg a few months ago, is available at Rs 35 per kg now. Along with vegetables, simple fruits like apple now sells at Rs 60 to Rs 70 per kg in the markets across Purnia division. ""Every morning, before we arrange our vend at the vegetable mart, we get in touch with our suppliers at different places like Delhi and Siliguri (West bengal), and then decide on the prices of vegetables in the local market,"" candidly admits vegetable seller Mohammad Kalam at Kishanganj.As the festive season knocks at the door, vegetables will be the mainstay of daily diet.Many will only be skipping non-vegetarian dishes like mutton and chicken. Mutton prices are hovering at Rs 340 to Rs 400 per kg, chicken too is pocket pincher at Rs 220 or more per kg. Fishes rule at anything between Rs 180 to Rs 400 per kg depending on its delicacy.""The household expenses have made a quantum jump and prices of all items of daily use only get on our nerves,"" tells a retired school teacher Siyawar Singh."" We are simply managing two square meals a day even as our daily expenditure has made a jump. But, spiraling prices make our lives extremely painful,"" said an autorickshaw driver Hamid in Purnia."
439,439,"Onion, potato prices in Delhi go down",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Onion-potato-prices-in-Delhi-go-down/articleshow/26758119.cms,2013-12-03,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: The party that comes to power in Delhi will be greeted with moderating food and vegetable prices, with onion and potato rates showing a downward trend which is expected to reduce further in the next couple of weeks.Onion and potato prices have already reduced with fresh produce flooding major mandis. Market analysts said while onion was now selling between Rs 40 and Rs 50 a kg, it may fall to Rs 20-30 by mid-January while potato would be available for less than Rs 15 a kg.Comparison of retail prices of the two key commodities in the past 15 days in Delhi shows that onion prices fell by Rs 13 per kg and potato prices fell by Rs 7. Potato prices will reduce further when supply from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh picks up.""There will be huge supply. Now farmers in these two states are taking out fresh crop in small quantity. But we hope it won't be as bad as last year when Punjab farmers preferred throwing their crops on roads rather than selling at low price,"" said H P Sharma, deputy director (statistics) at National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NDRF).He added that prices of all other vegetables including cabbage, cauliflower and tomato will reduce further in the next one month because of fresh production.The state BJP has announced to control prices within a month of coming to power, which experts say will happen automatically. ""But it will obviously go in favour of the new government and will be a feel good factor just before the next Lok Sabha election. It will help the party in power to consolidate its position,"" said a horticulture expert.However, the relief comes much late than what the incumbent Congress government had expected. Usually onion prices moderate by second week of October and potato by November first week. But this year this prediction went haywire due to extended monsoon that delayed harvesting of fresh crops.Exceptional onion price rise has been a political issue in the national capital since 1998 election when Sheila Dikshit defeated Sushma Swaraj. This time Swaraj has termed the repeat of price rise as ""divine"" intervention to throw Congress out of power."
440,440,Onions and tomatoes ease to Rs 40 per kg,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Onions-and-tomatoes-ease-to-Rs-40-per-kg/articleshow/26813124.cms,2013-12-04,The Times Of India,"MUMBAI: Three months after onion prices peaked to Rs 60 per kg, fresh winter arrivals have thawed the freeze a bit.Wholesale rates of onions and tomatoes dropped to Rs 16 and Rs 13 respectively at the APMC Vashi on Tuesday. Consumers who had been buying them for Rs 60-80 were marginally relieved as retail prices eased to Rs 35-40 per kg.Nearly 62,283 quintals (1 quintal equals 100kg) of onions arrived at state mandis, with an average price of Rs 15.96 per kg on Tuesday. Similarly, 18,507 quintals of potatoes came at Rs16.75 per kg. State government fair price shops sold onions for Rs 26 and tomatoes for Rs 32.Rates were marginally higher in the open market. Retailer R S Mani sold ""good quality"" onions and tomatoes for Rs 36 at Antop Hill. ""Prices will continue to fall over the next few days as fresh stocks arrive,"" he said. Localities like Lokhandwala Complex in Andheri and Pali Market in Bandra bucked the trend and continued to charge Rs 40-50.APMC director Ashok Walunj, who heads the onion-potato market, was not too pleased that wholesale rates had dipped. ""Prices have ebbed to Rs 15-20 per kg but this is too little for farmers to break even, let alone make a decent profit. The new bumper crop has been harvested and they have to release it, they cannot hold on to it any longer. Within a few days, we will see a flood of new bulbs. It remains to be seen if rates fall further,"" Walunj said.A leading tomato trader from Mumbai Central said wholesale prices were expected to dip in the next fortnight. ""The Gujarat crop was damaged by rain, so once the new batch arrives, prices will reduce,"" he said.But a tomato exporter from Gujarat said the crop from that state was consumed locally, and it was not sent to Mumbai or New Delhi as before. Tejas Patel of Dominance Impex said from Ahmedabad, ""It is true that 40% of Gujarat's previous tomato crop was destroyed by water-logging due to unseasonal rain during Navratra. But the new harvest is bountiful. In any case, our troubles have no impact on Mumbai as your city sources tomatoes from Nashik. Even Delhi traders who bought tomatoes from Gujarat are turning to Nashik."""
