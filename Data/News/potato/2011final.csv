Vaithilingam on Friday, is a market intervention activity by the government to provide a respite to consumers from high prices that prevail in the open market during the festival.The bazaar provides consumers with a variety of products, including vegetables, groceries, textiles, sugarcane and others, which are in great demand during the season. The self-service mode followed in the bazaar helps consumers spend more time and choose products of their choice.Last year, the bazaar netted a total sale of Rs. 35 lakh, with sugarcane sale alone earning Rs. 3.5 lakh. The contribution of sugarcane to this year's sales is expected to touch Rs. 5 lakh. Mr. Kumar said sugarcane has been directly procured from farmers from Thanjavur and Mannargudi and are sold at Rs. 12.50 a cane.The bazaar offers more than 28 varieties of rice and all varieties of pulses at rates lower than the market. Shirts, saris and dhotis are also offered at a discount.Though the bazaar offers products at lower prices, consumers said they see a marked increase in the rates when compared to prices during the Deepavali bazaar put up by PAPSCO.According to H. Geetha, a housewife, the soaring prices of pulses and vegetables has had an adverse impact on her spending for the festival. We usually buy good clothes and prepare a variety of sweets for pongal.' However, with price of products such as ghee and vegetables soaring, we are cutting down expenditure considerably, she said.On Sunday, the price of a kg of onion was Rs. 61. Other vegetables also saw a slight increase in rates with tomatoes being sold at Rs. 25 per kg and carrot Rs. 31 a kg. Consumers said that season specific vegetables such as yam and sweet potato have also seen considerable increase in prices."

Cold storage authorities had said they had thrown out 4,200 tonnes of potatoes on Wednesday after the government failed to meet the November 30 deadline for lifting the stocks.When the government had stocked the potatoes at the Panagarh storage, wholesale traders had offered to pay Re 1 a kg for the stock. But the government had refused saying the price was too low.We have received good response from the local people. We will sell off the full stock, said Uday Sarkar, the sabhadhipati of the CPM-run Burdwan zilla parishad. Aloke Bhattacharya, the zilla parishad functionary overseeing the sale, said that till this evening, 3,00,000kg had been sold.Based on an FIR lodged by Confed and Benfed, police raided cold storage owner Parijat Roys house in Asansol yesterday but did not find him there."

Apart from Pune and the adjacent districts, the Pune market also receives supply from north Karnataka. There are number of farmers who prefer to supply vegetables to Pune over Bangalore.""Compared to leafy vegetables like spinach and fenugreek, the price of vegetables like lady finger, cabbage and brinjal remained high. The period of maturity of these vegetables is longer, which sometimes affects the supply. It results in prices remaining on the higher side, whereas leafy vegetables, which can be grown in kitchen gardens as well, are available at very affordable prices.The price of onion, which was hovering around Rs 70 per kg last Sunday, came down to Rs 50 per kg later in the week and has stabilised at that level. Baby onions are available in the price range of Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kg. Cauliflower and cabbage prices are hovering around Rs 14 and Rs 18 per kg respectively in various parts of the city. Earlier, the prices were above Rs 30 and Rs 60 per kg in the retail market. Brinjal and potato prices are around Rs 32 and Rs 16 per kg respectively.Leafy vegetables are more affordable with a single-digit price tag. Spinach and fenugreek bunches are available for Rs 5 in the retail market. Agricultural production improved with harvesting activity for onion, leafy vegetables and some cereals beginning in the second week of November, when rainfall stopped completely.Though the supply has increased and the prices were reasonable, it will not reflect in the farmer's earnings, according to market experts. Some vegetables are getting costlier because of the increased transportation cost.Though it is bought at the farm at cheaper rate, the increased price of petrol and diesel are also adding to the costs in the retail market.Metro cities will face the heat more as most of the supply to Pune comes from places at least 50 kg away from the city, hence the transportation cost is likely to be added in the prices of vegetables, said a commission agent at Market Yard."

Thanks to a bumper potato production, vegetable prices have crashed by up to 50 per cent. Over the past fortnight, prices of potatoes plunged by 60-70 per cent in retail markets.The prices were hovering at Rs 20 to Rs 25 per kg about a month ago, and now have come down to Rs 7 to Rs 8 per kg.Market players attribute the fall in potato prices to high production and inadequate cold-storage capacity. A further fall is expected by next month and potatoes could be available for merely Rs 4 per kg in retail markets.""The price slide has happened because of improved supply from upcountry and local farmers. Much depends on local production,"" said Kishore Parihar, a wholesale dealer.Potato growers, mainly from Deesa, Palanpur, Himmatnagar and Dahegam in North Gujarat, are optimistic about recovering heavy losses incurred in 2008.The director of research of the Sardar Patel Dantiwada Agricultural University (SDAU), SBS Tikka, said: ""We expect a bumper potato crop which could lead to a further fall in prices. And the arrival of the Sanga type of potato in the market has begun. We feel all cold-storage facilities will be quickly filled up this time.""A farmer from Athamanavas Ranpura, Ramesh Thanasi Mali, said: ""Many farmers in north Gujarat, the largest potato growing region of the state, had queued up at cold storages in 2008, but could find no space.""Usually in February and March, prices of potatoes crash and so do the rates of even cauliflower, cabbage and other vegetables, said Bhagwan Dasani, a wholesaler in Mehsana."

Thereafter, they started dipping and reached a level of Rs. 3 per kg. But now as the harvesting has started, the rates have again come down, they said.Potato growers have ascribed the steep decline in prices to bumper crop in Punjab and other key potato growing States including West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.Even as States like West Bengal, Gujarat and Karnataka brought down the area under cultivation, the yield of the crop is expected to be better because of weather conditions remaining conducive for the potato crop during the entire season, leading to bumper output of potato. As a result of it, the prices have come down sharply, Jalandhar Potato Growers' Association general secretary Jaswinder Singh told PTI.Potato growers however pointed out the prevailing rates do not even cover their total cost.Our total cost including input, transportation involved in potato worked out at Rs. 3 a kg while current rates are ruling lower than that, said a farmer who grows crop on his own land.The problems for big potato growers, who cultivate crop at leased land, are further compounded by the fact that they were losing out over Rs. 3 per kg on potato crop at current rates.Our break-even is at Rs 6 per kg because of large cost involved in getting land on lease and quality input, said Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers president Sukhjit Singh Bhatti.Even Punjab Agricultural University in its latest report has predicted low rate of potato crop at Rs 2.5 to 3 per kg in next two months.Seeking intervention of State Government, potato growers have demanded introduction of freight subsidy on transportation of crop for export and other states.The Punjab Government in 2009 had announced freight subsidy of Rs. 400 per tonne for purposes of marketing of potatoes within country and Rs 1,500 per tonne for export.Punjab this season grew potato in an area of 84,000 hectares and expects an output of 22 lakh tonne. Punjab has almost five to seven per cent share in country's total potato production.It mainly grows varieties of Pukhraj, Jyoti, Kufri Chandramukhi, Kufri Bahar and Kufri Ashoka. - PTI"

This is also the time when a lot of green leafy vegetables arrive in the market."" Unlike fuel, if vegetable prices rise, they also fall, pointed out Soundarajan.

Similar sales are also being reported from Asansol in Burdwan.In the last week of January, West Bengal State Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd popularly known as BENFED is said to have sold out 10,317 packets of 50 kg potatoes, each, at Ashirbad cold storage in Kandi, 23,469 packets in Domkal, 19,989 packets in Burwan and 19,053 packets at Jiagunj's B J cold storage. According to sources, some stock at Domkal went out for Rs12 a kg.Traders who bought the potatoes said most of the supply was ""rotten"" as the cold storages had stopped refrigeration since December 15. This, when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had pointed a finger at the Centre over a recent Supreme Court observation that foodgrains and vegetables were wasting in godowns.Ashoke Das and Nathun Ghosh, two cold storage workers, blamed the state for the loss. ""The government could have got the stock released in November,"" said Ghosh.Unwilling to comment on the issue, BENFED's district manager Sabatullah Sheikh said, ""We have nothing to do. We only carried out government instructions.""Authorities reportedly picked up lesser-known local bulletins to float the tender for purchase, 48 hours before the work order, a process that does not go well with government norms. The lack of transparency in the process prompted a section of cold storage owners to complain that the tender process was a sham. ""It was just a formality. Potatoes mentioned in the tender were sold out much earlier in November. It is a scam that needs to be looked into,"" a cold storage employee said.The procurement process is also not above scrutiny. For instance, most potatoes procured in Murshidabad were of inferior ""Pokhraj"" quality, not fit for storing. The admission came from senior CPM leader Benoy Konar. Besides, the stocks were procured from Gudhia in Jiagunj and Jayachandrapur in Nabagram, which are not potato-growing areas.Konar didn't rule out foul play in the transaction. ""I am not going into the specifics. It is my view that the government shouldn't have gone for purchasing potatoes. For, it doesn't have the expertise. In Murshidabad, the government incurred huge losses by purchasing inferior quality potatoes. In some cases, government red tape also comes in the way of instant decisions, which are vital in the trading of perishable commodities like potatoes,"" said Konar."

Joshi, chief economist of rating agency Crisil, In the coming weeks, we can expect further moderation in food prices, especially foodgrains. The expected record production of wheat and pulses will help to ease the prices of food.Analysts said inflation would come down further on the back of a bumper production of wheat and pulses.However, the decline in food inflation is unlikely to have much of an impact on overall inflation figures for January, which are expected to be released on Monday."

Considering that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had no option but to up its comfort zone for inflation to 7 per cent for 2010-11 from 5-6 per cent projected earlier, analysts feel that the apex bank is unlikely to ease its hawkish stance on key policy rates during the mid-quarterly monetary review on March 17.Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) Chairman C. Rangarajan is of the view that further monetary tightening may be necessary to contain the inflationary pressures. [The] RBI will have to take a view looking at level of inflation. It is still at an uncomfortably high level. Some action, continued action, by the RBI [to tighten monetary policy] may be required, he said. The WPI headline inflation data for January has revealed that while sugar turned cheaper by 14.99 per cent, pulses by 12.78 per cent, wheat by 4.94 per cent and potatoes by 1.21 per cent on a year-on-year basis, vegetable prices remained higher by 65 per cent and onion prices were almost double. Alongside, fruits were dearer by 15.01 per cent, as were protein-based items such as eggs, meat and fish by 15.09 per cent. In a cautiously optimistic note, Mr. Mukherjee said: Even though overall food inflation is a matter of concern, we must remember that we have come a long way from the peak...we still have some distance to go in controlling inflation.As for the fuel and power' category, the index surged by 11.41 per cent mainly owing to the prices of petrol soaring by 27.37 per cent on an annual basis.

In quite some time, food inflation will also be under single digit, Mukherjee said, adding that headline inflation will moderate to 7 per cent by March-end from 8.23 per cent in January.Driven by high vegetable prices, food inflation has been in double digits for the past two months and had even crossed 18 per cent in the last week of December.On an annual basis, prices of potatoes declined by 13.63 per cent, pulses by 5.88 per cent and wheat by 2.54 per cent in the week ended February 5.However, on the whole, vegetables became nearly 24 per cent costlier during the week ended February 5. This was primarily on account of onions, which were 31.33 per cent higher during the week on an annual basis. Meanwhile, decline in food inflation for past two weeks prompted Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia to say the trend would continue.Other economists, however, said while there would be further moderation in vegetable prices, overall food inflation will remain in double digits in this month.Even though prices have come down over the previous week, the average rate of food inflation on a yearly basis, at 17 per cent, is still high. The finance minister also sounded caution that weekly decline in food inflation could be deceptive. He, however, expects wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation to come down to 7 per cent by March-end.I hope, as I mentioned earlier, by March we able to reach overall inflation of 7 per cent, Mukherjee added. Headline inflation, as measured on the basis of WPI, moderated to 8.23 per cent in January from 8.43 per cent in the previous month. During the first week of February, the fuel price index was up 11.92 per cent for the week."

On an annual basis, overall vegetables remained about 24 per cent dearer during the week mainly owing to higher prices of onions as compared to the previous year. However, potatoes turned cheaper by 13.63 per cent.Even as Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia expects the declining trend in food inflation to continue, other analysts are of the view that the WPI numbers would remain in double digits during the whole of February despite a further fall in vegetable prices.

Conceding that high food prices has been a matter of concern, Dr. Singh said: I will be the first one to admit that inflation in the last 18 months has become a problem. There were reasons beyond our control. First of all, there was the drought of 2009 and there were natural calamities which affected the production of important products such as vegetables and onions.Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia also maintained that food inflation would ease to single digit by the end of the current fiscal while noting that the country had sufficient stocks of cereals to stem the inch-up in prices. The WPI data revealed that prices of cereals had increased a tad during the week ended February 12 with inflation in cereals at 2.07 per cent and rice at 1.65 per cent on a year-on-year basis.

Milk prices also went up by five per cent while mutton turned two per cent dearer.As for fuel items, prices of furnace oil and naphtha rose by two per cent each.

Besides, the marginal drop in inflation has taken place even as prices of manufactured products and fuel and power have shown upward trend.The impact of recent petrol price hike on inflation will be known only when the inflation data for May will be out. Analysts say the marginal drop in inflation level as noticed in April will be short lived if the government makes an upward revision in retail prices of three other mass consumed products likediesel, domestic cooking gas (LPG) and kerosenein the face of rise in global crude oil prices.Comparatively the overall inflation in April appears to be low when compared with the revised figure in March. The overall inflation, as measured on the basis of the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), now stands revised to 9.04 per cent for March from the original projection of 8.98 per cent.As the government explains the revision was carried out as metal products were not incorporated earlier due to a programming error. Despite marginal decline the overall inflation at less than 9 per cent continues to stand at high level compared to tolerable limit of 5 to 6 per cent prescribed by the Reserve Bank.In fact, the RBI in its monetary policy for 2011-12 has projected that inflationary pressure would continue to sustain for some more months before moderating to around 6 per cent by March, 2012. The Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee while remaining cautious on movement of inflation in coming months said the April prices had come down both on manufacturing sector and the food sector. This is a good trend and if it continues then perhaps it will be more moderate.Analysis of data shows the prices of primary articles -- food, non-food articles and minerals  went up by 12.05 per cent on an annual basis. While food items shot up by 8.71 per cent, non-food primary articles rose by over 27 per cent.As far as price movement of key vegetables is concerned onion was cheaper by 6.37 per cent on an annual basis while potatoes became less expensive by 0.54 per cent. During April fuel and power prices went up by 13.32 per cent. Keeping the pressure on overall inflation the manufactured goods group index rose by 6.18 per cent on an annual basis.

Noting that though uncertainty still prevailed on the fuel price front, he said a decline in overall primary articles' inflation was also evident.... If the declining trend in food items and non-food primary articles continues, then perhaps it will be possible to have a moderate rate of inflation  The important figure is the non-food WPI. There is practically a two percentage point decrease from 23.22 per cent to 21.31 per cent [in that segment]. My comment is that there will be a moderation in inflation, Mr. Mukherjee said.Mr. Mukherjee also felt that analysts should look at the broader picture and not the week-to-week or month-to-month inflation figures even though the fact remains that the retail prices of diesel and LPG are expected to be raised some time during this month which, in turn, would get reflected in the WPI inflation data with a fortnight's time lag.Commenting on the WPI data, financial services firm Kassa Director Siddharth Shankar said: The numbers have shown some improvement, but it is too early to say that inflation will fall in the coming months. We still have to see the impact of fuel price hike.During the week, prices of pulses eased by 9.22 per cent year-on-year, while wheat turned cheaper by 0.77 per cent.

Price of peas has more than doubled to touch Rs 150 a kg, while cabbages are available for Rs 5 a kg in the retail market.Price of beans has also doubled, while that of drumstick, carrots and potatoes has reduced. Most vegetables sold in the city are transported by trucks from neighbouring states.Dealers and vendors blame the price change on the heavy downpour in Karnataka and Maharashtra. S Chandran, a wholesale dealer in beans at the Koyambedu market, said showers meant bad news for beans growers. ""Rains adversely affect beans crop, causing fungal diseases and increase of pests in the soil,"" he said.On the other hand, vegetables such as drumstick and carrots have benefited. ""Rains have ensured high yields resulting in a good harvest of drumsticks, carrots and potatoes, leading to a dip in prices,"" said V R Soundarajan, market advisor to the wholesaler's association in Koyambedu. ""Peas are short in supply since they are usually in great demand during this wedding season,"" he added.The rains also affect the transportation of goods and the perishable commodities arrive late at the market.Retail outlets such as Reliance Fresh, More and Nilgiris said the prices have not affected sales. ""Increase and decrease of prices are common during this season. That would not affect our sales in any manner,"" said R Yuvraj, manager of More supermarket on TTK Road.

However, it has again started going up since the second half of May.The latest fall in food inflation numbers is likely to come as a relief to the government, which had to deal with a series of bad news during recent weeks on the economic front.While January-March economic growth stood at 7.8 per cent, the lowest in five quarters, industrial output also slowed down to 6.3 per cent in April."

That has its impact.Mr. Mukherjee went on to add that there could be some upward movement in headline inflation in June from 9.06 per cent in May and this would be mainly owing to the fuel price hike announced last month.Evidently, the apprehension is that while food prices would tend to soften in the event of a good monsoon, the hike in fuel prices could affect the overall trend. In fact, the food segment may again get impacted by way of higher transportation costs for grains and other crops.During the week, pulses turned cheaper by over 9 per cent year-on-year, while prices of vegetables and potatoes eased by 8.74 per cent and 2.13 per cent, respectively.

High prices of milk, egg, meat and pulses also kept pressure on food inflation, which rose to the highest level in over six months, the government data showed Thursday.Food inflation figure for the week ending October 8 was 10.60 per cent.The price pressure on perishable items, particularly fruits, meat, milk, eggs and fish continued due to supply mismatch with the rising demand of such items. The imbalance has worsened by rising rural wages and consequent demand pressure from rural India and the absence of growth in agricultural productivity.Fuel prices have indeed contributed to food price hike. Although crude prices have declined in recent times on the international market, the benefit has been offset by the fall in the value of the Indian rupee. The rupee breached Rs 50 a dollar last week, making imports especially crude oil costlier, fanning fears of higher inflation and widening of the subsidy bill of the cash-strapped government.Besides, there are structural factors contributing to high food inflation in India, such as, the creaking food distribution and storage system. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has taken steps in the past and raised key policy rates as many as 13 times in the past 12 months to tame inflation, but they have had little impact on arresting food inflation.On the contrary, costlier loan has hampered the economic growth rate in the first quarter of current fiscal.According to RBI Governor D Subbarao, lower production of pulses and inadequate supply of protein-based food may put further pressure on food prices in the near term.Pulses became dearer by 9.06 per cent and cereal prices were up 4.62 per cent year-on-year for the week under review. But the effect of good monsoon and the governments efforts to manage the demand and supply mismatch appeared to be yielding results in some areas with wheat prices for the week under review coming down 0.95 per cent. Onion also became cheaper -- close to 19 per cent and a downward movement was also seen in potato prices. The primary articles price index was up 11.75 per cent, compared with an annual rise of 11.18 per cent a week earlier despite RBIs continued efforts to raise key policy rates to tame inflation.The Central bank raised rates for the 13th time on Tuesday to fight inflation that topped 9 per cent for nearly a year. The government and policy makers are of the view that headline inflation will start moderating from December and come close to 7 per cent by March 2012.

277,277,Food cost tastes foul ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1111028/jsp/business/story_14676276.jsp,2011-10-28,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Oct. 27: A spike in the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk has pushed food inflation to a six-month high of 11.43 per cent for the week ended October 15, putting pressure on policy makers to think of alternative measures to contain it as monetary tightening had not yielded the desired results. While vegetables became 25 per cent costlier on an annual basis, fruits grew dearer by 11.96 per cent, milk by 10.85 per cent and eggs, meat and fish by 12.82 per cent, food inflation data released today showed. Food inflation, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), was at 10.60 per cent in the previous week. The double-digit inflation comes on top of a very high level of price rise recorded in October last year, when it stood at 14.20 per cent  already a high-base comparison. The last time that food inflation stood around this level was on April 9 when it was 11.53 per cent. The rising food inflation is a serious matter. Rate hikes did not seem to have the desired effect as seen in the high headline inflation. Issues of supply constraint have to be addressed, Crisil chief economist D.K. Joshi said. Pulses and cereals, which had remained subdued in recent months, have started catching up and became expensive by 9.06 per cent and 4.62 per cent, respectively, on an annual basis. However, onions became 18.93 per cent cheaper and prices of wheat and potatoes were also down 0.95 per cent and 0.45 per cent, respectively, year-on-year during the week under review. With vegetable prices unlikely to ease until after the festive season, food inflation may remain elevated in the remaining weeks of October, Icra economist Aditi Nayar said. Food prices have remained high for several months, driven by growing demand for high-protein diets, which is the result of more income at the hands of the rural people partly because of the governments job guarantee programme. Adding to the woes is the inefficient distribution system, which causes frequent supply disruptions. Analysts attributed the increase in food prices to a host of factors which range from poor logistics to the festival season. A long-term approach to contain food inflation needs to be put in place with better logistics and cold storages."

Alongside, eggs, meat and fish were also costlier by 12.82 per cent.What is hurting the common man all the more is that this fresh bout of double-digit inflation is over and above the 14.20 per cent spurt witnessed during the same week in October, 2010. In effect, there is no statistical anomaly of base effect in play in the current surge in prices which is very close to the high of 11.53 per cent recorded for the week ended April 9 this year.Dearer ediblesMore disconcerting for the authorities is the fact that edibles such as pulses and cereals  prices of which had eased in recent months  have started to become more expensive and turned dearer by 9.06 per cent and 4.62 per cent, respectively, on a yearly basis.Items which tended to cost less on an annual basis, however, were onions with their prices declining by 18.93 per cent while wheat and potatoes also turned cheaper by 0.95 per cent and 0.45 per cent, respectively.In a way, the spurt in food inflation, which has a significant share in the overall price spiral, vindicates the rate hike and the policy stance taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In its annual review, the apex bank had estimated headline inflation to remain high till December this year before tapering down to about 7 per cent by the end of the fiscal year in March, 2012.Noting that real wage inflation has extended into the first quarter of the current fiscal, the RBI, in its second quarter review said: Food inflation is likely to stay elevated due to demand-supply mismatches in non-cereals and large MSP [Minimum Support Price] revisions.Significantly, headline inflation, which also accounts for the price surge in manufactured items, has hovered above 9 per cent since December, 2010 and stood pegged at 9.72 per cent in September this year."

On July 16 food inflation stood at 7.16 per cent.The fall in inflation is due to fall in prices of essential items such as onions, potatoes and wheat giving relief to the common man, while rice and vegetables prices increased at a moderate pace. The declining trend has come as a relief to the government which is facing flak from the corporate India as well as the Opposition parties for not being able to manage the economy efficiently and effectively.Reacting to the declining inflationary trend, a relieved Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said: If this trend continues, perhaps we may have the year-end inflation at around 6-7 per cent.Onions became cheaper by 40.65 per cent year-on-year during the week under review, while potato prices were down by 10.98 per cent. Wheat prices also fell by 4.71 per cent.There was respite for the households as rice prices increased only by 2.52 per cent and vegetables by 5.13 per cent. Inflation with regard to vegetables, which are also affected by seasonal factors, had remained in double digit in the past months. However, prices of protein-based items such as milk, egg, meat and fish rose by double-digits.Experts feel that the fall in inflation could also have a positive spin-off for the industry and the middle-class borrowers since it sends a signal to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for a pause in the interest rates hike.The RBI will review the interest rates on December 16.After August, for the first time food inflation has come down to 8 per cent. Non-food inflation is steadily declining. In October 29, it was 6 per cent and now it has declined to 2.14 per cent, Mr. Mukherjee said.Inflation in the overall primary articles category stood at 7.74 per cent during the week ended November 19, as against 9.08 per cent in the previous week.Inflation in non-food articles was 2.14 per cent during the week under review, as against 4.05 per cent in the previous week ended November 12.Headline inflation has been above the 9 per cent-mark since December, 2010.

The farmers who are harvesting early sown potato crop are getting Rs 3 per kg and these are the lowest rates. Prices should have been at least Rs 5-6 per kg to save farmers from losses, a potato grower from Jalandhar said.In a scene reminiscent of Jharkhand where the farmers last year dumped the bumper tomato crop on the roads as the produce was selling fpor 50 paise per kg,the potato farmers in Punjab too have taken a similar step to highlight their woes.With their being no major demand from other states,the farmers said if state government fails to help them export the crop to other countries,they would be forced to dump nearly 50 lakh bags, each containing 50 kg potato on the roads. This would translate into 2.5 lakh tonnes of potato.Potato growers said that the state government should either take the onus to export the crop to other countries or provide freight subsidy so that the farmers could transport it to foreign shores.Following the sharp dip in the prices,the farmers say they can not send it to other states. Even storing the crop in the cold storage is not feasible due to high charges of nearly Rs 70 per bag, said a farmer.In the last season I had sent 5,000 bags to cold storage. I have been to sell only 2,000 bags that too at a very low price. Now,I have dumped the remaining 3,000 bags at various places as I cannot afford to pay the rent at the cold storage, Amarjit Singh,a potato grower from of Chak Chela village,said.Other farmers like Joga Singh and Swaran Singh,both from Jalandhar,also dumped upto 400 bags each by the road side.Farmers have been forced to dump the last seasons crop,as there are no buyers and most of them cant bear the expenses of cold storage, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha,general secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA).The prices of potato have crashed from Rs 800 per quintal last year to Rs 100 to 150 per quintal this year. There was a bumper crop in Punjab in January this year. Other states such as UP and West Bengal too recorded good produce,resulting in low price of potato, Sangha said.In fact,there is no fixed price for the crop harvested in January-february 2011 lying in the cold stores. The new crop is being sold at Rs 300 per quintal, he added.Nearly 50 lakh bags (2.5 lakh tonnes) of the last seasons crop are still lying in the cold stores.It may be noted that Doaba region with nearly 85,000 hectares under potato production leads the state in producing the crop.JPGA press secretary,Iqbal Singh Chatta,said that that last year Punjab produced more then 2.1 million tonnes of potatoes. In the current season the figures would go up. The state has a capacity to store nearly 16 lakh tonnes of potato in some 500 cold stores.Sangha added that they have met the government authorities several times since January this year to make arrangements to export the potato to other countries,but to no avail.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

An unrelenting Opposition accused the government of pursuing wrong economic policies. According to the government data released on Thursday, food prices index was down due to fast softening of onion, potato and wheat prices. Onion was cheaper by close to 40 per cent in the week under review, while potato prices were down by nearly 16 per cent.Food inflation stood at 8 per cent in the previous week. But, the prices of protein-based items continued to grow more expensive on an annual basis. Replying to the debate on price rise in Rajya Sabha, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said the food prices were continuously showing a downward trend in the past weeks, but maintained that the prices would not come down overnight.He attributed the rise in overall prices to poor distribution system, international economy and rise in global petroleum prices.He also sought the cooperation of the Opposition in containing prices and carrying out reforms, especially in foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail. The BJP, however, rejected the state of helplessness expressed by the finance minister and staged a walk out from the House.Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said rampant corruption in the government along with wrong economic policies was responsible for the skyrocketing prices.Gurudas Dasgupta of the CPI, who attributed the current softening of prices to seasonal factors, asked the government to aim at brining down inflation in the long term.Experts too said the decline in inflation is an outcome of the plentiful kharif harvest.Economists maintained it was too early for the Reserve Bank of India to reverse its monetary policy stance although growth in the previous quarters was stuttering.Although the growth scare has intensified in the last few months, it is too premature to say RBI will completely reverse its stance on December 16.

It stood at 6.19% in the week to August 9, 2008.Stubbornly high food prices have posed a serious challenge for policymakers and upset household budgets. High food prices have also led to protests. Food inflation has hovered around double digits for a significant period while overall inflation is still near double digits.Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee defended the government strategy to deal with price pressures and said retail prices of 30 essential commodities, including that of rice, wheat and pulses, had either fallen or had registered a marginal increase during the past two years.""It is not correct to say that government has not done anything,"" Mukherjee told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.Economists said the downtrend in food prices and slowing growth could prompt the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to pause in its interest rate tightening cycle. The RBI will undertake a policy review next week and most experts say they expect the central bank to hold rates at current levels. The RBI has raised interest rates 13 times since March 2010 to calm price pressures but they have remained stubborn.The latest data showed vegetable prices fell an annual 1.25% in the week to November 26 after rising sharply for the past few weeks. Onion prices continued to decline and fell 39.20% year-on-year while potato prices were down an annual 15.75%. Prices of milk, egg, meat and fish continued to remain firm.The index for food articles group declined by 1% to 193.8 from 195.7 for the previous week due to lower prices of fish-inland and jowar (3% each), fruits and vegetables, condiments and spices, masur and urad (2% each) and fish-marine, poultry chicken, barley and moong (1% each). But prices of ragi (3%), pork (2%) and gram, mutton, maize, egg and arhar (1% each) moved up.Policymakers expect overall inflation to ease to 6-7% range by end-March but economists say it will hover above the comfort level. On Thursday, ratings agency Crisil marginally revised upwards its forecast for inflation in 2011-12 to 9.2% from the previous 9.1%.""This is because the continuous weakening of the rupee has exerted additional pressure on the imported component of inflation. We now expect the rupee to end the fiscal year at a lower value of Rs 48 per dollar as compared to the earlier forecast of Rs 45-46 per dollar. This will keep inflation at higher levels than expected earlier,"" said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.He said the upward revision in inflation also takes into account the continuing firmness in global crude oil prices which if it continues, could result in further fuel price pass through into domestic economy, since there is limited fiscal room to absorb further subsidies.The agency also cut its forecast for gross domestic product growth for 2011-12 to 7% from the previous estimate of 7.6% due to the weak global economic situation and the domestic investment climate."

The MIS is implemented in order to protect the interests of growers to avoid distress sale in the event of bumper crop when prices tend to fall below the cost of production,as has happened in Punjab for potato crop.Unions including Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA),Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers (POSCON) and Bhartiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) stated that due to bumper production,40 lakh bags of crop are still lying in cold storage.JGPA president Raghbir Singh said that when there was glut in Bengal in 2009,Centre had given Rs 85 crore subsidy to the potato growers and the same can be done in Punjab.

In some commodities such as potatoes which witnessed a 33% decline, farmers in several parts of the country are dumping the crop on the streets or letting it rot as there is a bumper harvest and cold storages are full with last year's stocks.

Further, prices had gone up to unreasonable levels in December last year creating a high base effect, analysts said.Food inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), stood at 4.35 per cent in the previous week and 13.22 per cent in the corresponding week of 2010.This is the lowest rate of food inflation since the week ended February 9, 2008, when it stood at 2.26 per cent.There is the strong base effect, on top of a normal monsoon and good harvest. I believe the moderate rate will continue for at least a month or two and we can expect its impact in the December headline inflation numbers also, Crisil chief economist D.K. Joshi said.According to data, onion became cheaper by 49.38 per cent year-on-year during the week under review, while potato prices were down 34.39 per cent. Prices of wheat also fell 4.21 per cent.

It stood at 4.35 per cent in the previous week. The fall was mainly due to decline in prices of essential commodities such as onion and potato.The continued dip in inflation will certainly embolden the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates when it reviews the monetary policy on January 24. The latest food inflation numbers are the lowest since the week ended February 9, 2008, when it stood at 2.26 per cent.According to official data released here on Thursday, onion became cheaper by 49.38 per cent year-on-year during the week under review, while potato prices were down by 34.39 per cent. Prices of wheat also fell by 4.21 per cent. Overall, vegetables became cheaper by 26.37 percent.Experts feel that moderation in food inflation numbers, which was in double-digit in early November, was on account of good kharif harvest as well as a high base. They felt that it was an ideal situation for a rate cut by the RBI.The RBI, in its mid-quarter review on December 16, had kept the key rates unchanged. While inflation in vegetables and wheat segments eased during the reporting week, prices of protein-rich items such as eggs, milk and pulses have continued to remain high.Pulses became costlier by 14.22 per cent, while milk was dearer by 11.19 per cent and eggs, meat and fish by 9.25 per cent.Inflation in the overall primary articles category stood at 3.78 per cent during the week ended December 10, as against 5.48 per cent in the previous week."

We have to steer the economy back to the path of fiscal consolidation,"" prime minister Manmohan Singh told the meeting of his Council on Trade and Industry. ""While purchasing power has gone up, the supply side response has so far been muted.

Onion prices, which had shot sharply last year, fell an annual 49.38% while wheat prices were down 4.21%. Prices of fruits, eggs, meat and fish eased from the previous week but remained firm.Experts said arrival of fresh supplies had helped calm prices. The index for food articles group declined by 0.5% to 191.0 from 191.9 for the previous week due to lower prices of fruits and vegetables and condiments and spices (2% each) and ragi, tea and rice (1% each). But prices of jowar, gram and masur (2% each) and river fish, poultry chicken and sea fish (1% each) moved up.Stubbornly high food inflation has remained a huge policy challenge for the UPA government for the past few years and has contributed to higher overall inflation. RBI has raised interest rates 13 times since March 2010 to tame price pressures. Policymakers have been wrong-footed several times while predicting the trend of food prices."

At least 1 lakh sacks (each containing 55 kg) will be dump on the outskirts to empty the cold storages due to fresh arrival,"" added another cold storage owner.The situation is same in Kannauj, Farrukhabad and Mainpuri districts.""First farmers tried to sell potatoes at Rs 3 a kg. Then the situation came to such a pass that they started donating potatoes to poor people but even the latter refused to accept potatoes from them. Now, they (farmers) are not coming to take back the bags from cold storages as they have taken huge advances in form of loan. We are at a double loss.
