9,9,Farmersâ€™ protest? Potatoes thrown on Lucknow roads,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-protest-potatoes-thrown-on-lucknow-roads/article22389830.ece,2018-01-07,The Hindu,"Potatoes were hurled from a truck at various prominent places here on Saturday in what is seen as a protest by farmers against low purchase price of the produce. A State government spokesperson, however, dismissed the incident as the handiwork of miscreants.There was a truck which had sacks of potato, which were thrown from it in various parts of the city early this morning. So far no farmers group has claimed responsibility for this act. This seems to be the work of antisocial elements... We are probing all possible angles, said Lucknow District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma.He added that the potatoes were thrown on Vidhan Sabha Marg, near VVIP guest house and near the 1090 Crossing. The roads were then cleaned by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation.Pre-planned actToday it is the potato farmers who have thrown potatoes on the streets of Lucknow, tomorrow it may be the sugarcane farmers, the wheat and paddy farmers if the situation does not improve, said Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit.State Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi called it a pre-planned act. The potatoes which were thrown were partly or completely rotten and rejected in the mandi (market). It is a deliberate attempt to malign the image of the Yogi Adityanath government, he said."
35,35,Potato portents,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/crop-prices-modi-government-indian-farmers-potato-rates-5035179/,2018-01-23,Indian Express,"The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)Farmers are habitually great raconteurs. My grandfather would often narrate an episode, when he encountered a farmer sitting by a heap of potatoes in the middle of the night. On investigating what compelled the farmer to guard potatoes when there were no buyers, he was astonished to learn that the farmer was, in fact, keeping a watch to deter anyone from dumping their unsold spuds in his field. This 40-year-old episode got a rerun recently when farmers dumped their unsold produce in front of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home and office in Lucknow.The genesis of the potato crises in Lucknow, however, is more recent. In June 2014, soon after the BJP won a stunning mandate in the general elections, one of the first acts of the Union government was to rein in the price of potatoes (refer to my article, Making a hash of it, IE, July 5, 2014) by imposing a minimum export price (MEP), which was followed by bringing potatoes under the essential commodities Act (ECA) and permitting duty-free imports even though imports carried the risk of new diseases. Farmers were harassed and cold stores raided. The euphoria of the electoral victory celebrations drowned out the farmers sorrow. Farmers took home meagre profits, substantially less than they could have easily made. The presumptive loss to 50 lakh potato farmers on a very conservative basis was Rs 30,000 crore (total production 42 million tonnes X R.7/kg, the subdued price) amounting to Rs 60,000 per potato farmer.Profits from the previous harvest usually determine the acreage under sowing for the next season. Consequently, in the following year, India had a bumper crop of 48 million tonnes of potato in 2015 and prices crashed to Rs 2.75/kg. The government ignored the plight of farmers who subsequently failed to even recover the cost of sowing.2016 was a normal crop year in India, with 44 million tonnes of potato production. Without credible data, fearing inflation, the government overreacted and again imposed MEP. Without access to international markets, the prices faltered. Unfortunately, demonetisation in November that year made matters worse. The presumptive loss of Rs 22,000 crore (Rs 5/kg) was incurred by farmers, amounting to an average loss of Rs 44,000 per potato farmer for 2016 year alone. Our export restrictions were a bonanza for farmers in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Importers seek reliable business partners and India has become an unreliable supplier due to arbitrary policy decisions. Our produce now sells at a substantial discount compared to our neighbours.In 2017, due to the relatively firmer prices of 2016 and boosted by good weather, farmers produced 48 million tonnes of potato and prices literally crashed through the basement. When, even after 10 months of storage, prices were hovering between 50 paisa to Rs 2/kg, farmers completely lost hope. The cost of growing potatoes being Rs 6.50/kg and the additional cost of storage is Rs 2.50/kg, it became infeasible to even reclaim stocks from cold storages and potatoes were strewn in Lucknow and elsewhere.Do the farmers math: In two of the four years of the Modi government, when an opportunity arose to double farm incomes, the governments inflation targeting strategy kicked in and each potato farmer lost approximately Rs 1,04,000. The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. There is no denying that controlling food inflation has to be a priority. I confess, as a potato farmer, I have a vested interest in the issue but it is this experience that gives me insight. Our demand is fair and simple: Should the government intervene to subdue potato prices in a bad crop year, it is morally bound to give a minimum support price of Rs 9/kg in excess production year. Logically, a farmer allowed to make money in one year, would be better prepared to bear the losses on the farm in the next. If not, the farmer gets into a perpetual debt cycle and is compelled to seek financial sops. Consequently, most farmer organisations are content to limiting themselves to what the farmer understands  farm loan waiver and venture no further into the policymaking quagmire.In 2018, the planting is lower by a mere five per cent, and potato prices are expected to be remunerative. But historical data indicates that a short-sighted government may respond by imposing MEP/ECA. The solutions to the farm crises arent limited to budget allocations but rooted in a system where interventions to control food inflation are not harmonised with crop-price compensation. As far as the farmer livelihoods are concerned, state governments and the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer Welfare are becoming less relevant, as decisions of the Ministry of Food, Public Distribution & Consumer Affairs are demolishing the prime ministers grand plan for doubling farmer incomes.Farmers are demoralised. The promised sab ka saath sab ka vikas rings hollow, because its starkly evident that the government has decided to focus on the urban vote bank as a part of the strategy to win the parliamentary elections in 2019. About 50 per cent of the population is financially dependent directly on agriculture, but religious, caste and ever-changing narratives divide farmers across villages to the extent that farmers arent considered a political force to be reckoned with any more. The Opposition is in an equally sad state, without a farmer face to galvanise the community. Nevertheless, farmers could change fortunes in the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, allowing the Opposition to bask in the farmers misery.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

122,122,Sharp fall in supplies drives up prices of potatoes in Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sharp-fall-in-supplies-drives-up-prices-of-potatoes-in-delhi/articleshow/64515258.cms,2018-06-09,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: A more than 60% fall in the arrival of potatoes in Delhi has pushed the average price of the kitchen staple to Rs 25 a kg, while in Mumbai prices have touched Rs 24 despite supplies remaining constant in the past one month.Sources said the shortage in supply in Delhi and some other parts of north India has partly to do with the ongoing protests by farmers but the main reason for the rise in prices is a nexus of certain section of traders and middlemen.According to National Horticulture Board (NHB) data, the retail prices of potatoes in Delhi and Mumbai a month back were Rs 24 and Rs 20 respectively. The daily retail prices available in the consumer affairs ministrys price monitoring cell show there was an increase of Rs 10 and Rs 7 per kg of potato in Delhi and Mumbai on Friday as compared to the prices a year back.The consumer affairs ministrys data also show major increase in the prices of the staple food items across Uttar Pradesh and the maximum in Agra (by Rs 13 a kg) despite the state being the largest producer of crop. UP also has the maximum installed cold storage capacity to keep potatoes.The retail average prices in some of the cities in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have also increased by Rs 10 a kg in comparison to the prices of last year.Officials said the issue of increasing potato prices came up for discussion at the weekly meeting of an inter ministerial committee on Friday. NHB officials briefed the panel that there is enough potatoes in stock to meet demand despite a minor dip in harvest during last season.There can be no reason except nexus of certain section of traders and middlemen for the increasing prices. We have been producing 46-47 million tonnes of potatoes while our average consumption is around 40 million tonnes. We have cold storage capacity of 35 million tonnes, which is enough to meet our demand, said an official, who did not wish to be named.Sources said that since movement of agriculture produce is free between India and Bangladesh substantial quantity of potatoes has gone out of the country as domestic production in the neighbouring country was less during last season. Similar, potato production in Nepal also got impacted last season and there are indications of potatoes from India going to Nepal.Officials said prices will moderate in near future as supplies increase."
