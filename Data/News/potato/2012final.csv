6,6,"Production looks up, farmers downcast",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/production-looks-up-farmers-downcast/article2773051.ece,2012-01-04,The Hindu,"Buoyed by a record food production (241.56 million tonnes) in 2010-11 and expectation of the highest ever (123.95 million tonnes) output in kharif of 2011-12, the Centre has projected a total output of 245 million tonnes in 2011-12. This, despite the the sown area being lower in wheat, oilseeds, pulses and coarse grains this rabi season. Rabi paddy, though, has improved over last year.Agriculture Ministry officials appear satisfied with the progress made in 2011(calendar year). In fact, the Ministry recommended lifting of the ban on export of wheat and rice in view of the comfortable stock position. Wheat exports, prohibited since October 2007, have been allowed under Open General Licence since September 2011.Of special significance to the officials is that the major increase in foodgrains production has come from the non-traditional States of Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat.However, the year was also marked by continuing suicide by farmers, testifying to the fact that the growers remain in debt and are distressed, not getting remunerative price for their produce. Recently, Punjab farmers threw away their potato produce as it did not fetch them enough even to cover the input costs. There is also a simmering discontent among farmers over the shortfall in fertilizers.In Andhra Pradesh, farmers have taken a crop holiday and Punjab farmers are threatening to do the same. In fact, there are worrisome reports of Punjab farmers shifting from traditional to cash crops like sweat peas and maize this rabi. In recent years, maize, a cash crop, has emerged as a preference for its requirement in the poultry sector. With the problem of storage (of wheat and rice) staring the government in the face, some diversification is acceptable to it, especially as the requirement of foodgrains for its mandatory obligation under the National Food Security Bill is still far away.ControversyThe Bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha during the winter session, has been referred to the Standing Committee. In any case, the passage of the Bill is embroiled in a controversy over the Socio-Economic Caste Census that is supposed to facilitate identification of beneficiaries. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have raised objections. At the same time, a technical panel in the Planning Commission has been asked to look into the poverty estimates recommended by the Suresh Tendulkar Committee.All of this was reflected in the difficulty Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar faced in responding to the Rajya Sabha debate on the agrarian crisis and farmers' suicides. A cornered Minister took refuge in the fact that several issues related to agriculture such as irrigation, power, fertilizers, credit and storage were not within the purview of his Ministry. However, cutting across party lines, Opposition members did not relent until Mr. Pawar came up with the suggestion to form a House committee to study the matter.For the record, with a paltry allocation of Rs. 400 crore, the Agriculture Ministry turned its focus during 2011 to enhancing production in the eastern States of Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, eastern Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna. The allocation is considered poor by most States as it has to be implemented in a difficult terrain with poor infrastructure.Under the National Food Security Mission for crop development, the best achievement so far is in pulses: from a stagnating level of 14.5 million tonnes over the past 15 years, the production in 2010-11 reached 18.09 million tonnes. The adoption of 60,000 pulses villages gave a boost to the programme.Pigeon pea genomeRecently, Indian Council of Agriculture Research scientists, in collaboration with State Agriculture Universities and Banaras Hindu University, succeeded in decoding the pigeon pea (arhar) genome. Use of pigeon pea germ plasm resources is expected to accelerate the development of new varieties and hybrids brightening up the chances of higher productivity of pulses.During the year, the government set up the Norman Borlaug Institute for South Asia with centres in Ludhiana (Punjab), Samastipur (Bihar) and Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh). The institute will collaborate with others globally to meet food security challenges.The ICAR also launched a National Initiative on Climate-Resilient Agriculture for conducting research in adaptation and mitigation to climate change in crops, livestock and fisheries, and for natural resource management.All in all, the year that went by was a lucky one for crop production, in that the monsoon was favourable. The challenges in the coming year are high input costs, fertilizer shortage, making agriculture remunerative and finding storage space for farm produce, not to mention the wait and watch for a normal monsoon."
7,7,Food inflation dips to -3.36 percent; RBI may cut rates,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/216883/food-inflation-dips-336-percent.html,2012-01-05,Deccan Herald,"New Delhi, Jan 5 (IANS) 18:57 ISTThe sharp drop in food inflation and easing in overall inflationary pressure may prompt the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut policy rates in its next monetary policy review later this month.The annual food inflation fell to -3.36 percent for the week ended Dec 24, as compared to 0.42 percent in the previous week and 20.84 percent during the corresponding week of last year.""There has been substantial improvement. Food inflation has turned negative for the first time in recent memory,"" Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters, reacting on the weekly data.Food inflation during the week under review was the lowest since April 2006. After remaining near double-digit for almost two years, food inflation has dropped sharply in the last two months. It has dipped for the ninth consecutive week.It came down to single-digit in the second week of November and has slid consistently since then. It was recorded at 10.63 percent for the week ended Nov 5. The sharp decline in food inflation is partly because of the base effect and also improved supply of seasonal crops. During the corresponding weeks of last year, annual inflation was almost near 20 percent.The data released by the ministry of commerce and industry showed the prices of vegetables were less than half during the week when compared to the prices in the corresponding week of last year.Onions became cheaper by 73.74 percent while the price of potatoes dropped by 34.01 percent year-on-year. Inflation in overall primary articles, which has 20.12 percent weightage in the wholesale price index, also dropped sharply to 0.10 percent for the week ended Dec 24 as compared to 2.70 percent in the previous week and 22.68 percent in the corresponding week of last year.However, fuel and power inflation rose marginally to 14.60 percent during the week under review as compared to 14.37 percent in the previous week. Economists said the recent drop in food inflation and easing in overall inflationary pressure may prompt the central bank to cut interest rates.""The environment appears to be in favour of the Reserve Bank of India reversing its monetary policy stance,"" said C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Minister's economic advisory council.The RBI last month kept policy rates unchanged after hiking the key rates 13 times since the beginning of 2010. Rangarajan said food inflation was likely to remain near zero or in the negative territory till March.""This was expected as the seasonal trend has caused vegetable prices to come down in the recent months. I see food inflation negative in January and negative or close to zero by March.""The fall in food inflation has raised hopes of a decline in headline inflation based on the wholesale price index which, according to the latest available data, was recorded at 9.11 percent in November.Rangarajan said the overall inflation would fall below 7 percent by the end of the current financial year.The following are the yearly rise and fall in prices in the week under review of some main commodities that form the sub-index for food articles:Onions: (-) 73.74 percentVegetables: (-) 50.22 percentFruits: 10.87 percentPotatoes: (-) 34.01 percentEggs, meat, fish: 13.82 percentCereals: 1.97 percentRice: 1.46 percentWheat: (-) 3.41 percentPulses: 13.85 percent"

This is the first time in almost six years, for which data with base year 2004-05 is available, that food inflation has shown a decline on an annual basis.Encouraged by the development, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said, ""There has been substantial improvement.

9,9,Contract farming way out for potato growers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Contract-farming-way-out-for-potato-growers/articleshow/11370291.cms,2012-01-05,The Times Of India,"BANKURA: Plummeting potato prices for three consecutive years have prompted farmers to switch to contract farming this season. The reason is obvious. No one wants to get burdened with loans after the farming when it costs Rs 14,000 a bigha. The trend is picking up in as many as 19 blocks of south Bengal - Hooghly, Burdwan, Birbhum, West Midnapore, Howrah and Bankura.""Potato farming is becoming disastrous with packets of the crop kept in cold storage offered at 50 paisa or one rupee a kilo without any taker,"" said Meghanjan Dutta of Shiromonipur village under Kotulpur block in Bankura.For them, tying up with the PepsiCo India is the only alternative for an assured return. ""It's not that they are offering much. But at least we are assured of the return six months ago. Also, we don't have to take the produce to the local mundi or transport them to the cold storage on our own,"" Dutta said.What is the contract? The farmer gives his land and labour. PepsiCo officials provide the seed - Atlanta and Chipsona - different from the traditional Jyoti or Pokhraj variety and the technology support. They supervise the cultivation and give advice to farmers from time to time. After the yield they take the produce to their own storage. The farmer gets Rs 6 for each kilo of potato. Advantage for the hapless farmers is that they get to know about the procurement price while they start sowing the seeds. They get crop insurance, seeds and loans from PepsiCo agents that they need to pay after the yield.Meghraj Dutta, owner of 6 bigha of land, has had enough of traditional cultivation.""We didn't take to contract farming last year though the PepsiCo came to our village. We thought that the price on offer by the company was too low compared to the profit we made in the open market four years ago. But it didn't happen. Prices kept falling despite the rising input costs such as seeds, fertilisers, insecticides. I can't take it any more. I thus opted for contract farming though the procurement price is not high. The second thing is that the company won't take all the produce. It will grade potatoes and take those that suit its requirement. It becomes difficult to sell the reject low sugar potato variety. But then it is better than what we are facing now,"" Dutta said.Owner of two-bigha land Chittaranjan Nandi of Panahar village has also joined hands with PepsiCo. ""With the profit I earned five years ago I married off my two daughters. Now I can't support my son studying at the Chandernagore Government College even. I can't take the risk,"" Nandi said. Shyamsundar Guin from the Galsi block in Burdwan is also going for contract farming on 10 bighas of land. ""Some farmers in the Kalna block have also opted for contract farming,"" Guin said.Sensing the mood, the PepsiCo Holdings India has doubled its target this year. It plans to rope in 9,000 farmers doing the job in 5,000 acres of land. Assistant manager PepsiCo, Fritolay division Prabal Roy said: ""We are not going for direct purchase from farmers. We are procuring the produce through vendors. Last year purchased 10,000 tonnes of potato and sent it our stores. We plan to procure 20,000 tonnes this season. We won't release this potato in the market. We thank the state government and officials of allowing us approach the villagers.""Incidentally, PepsiCo made an entry into potato farming in Hooghly during the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government. During the Left Front tenure, it could not make foray in Bankura because of political opposition.Sukdeb Shyam of Baghrol village in Bankura, however, stood out as one who has taken to traditional farming even this season. Shyam owns 15 bighas of land and is in a position to sustain the loss. ""I suffered a loss of Rs 7,000. But I am not into contract farming. I hope to make profits from the traditional variety this season. The price on offer by the PepsiCo is not encouraging,"" said Shyam.Deputy director Bankura agriculture division Abani Mohan Hazra said PepsiCo approached the division. ""Their (PepsiCo) officials told us that the company had been carrying out commercial farming on an experimental basis. This time, they want to go for it in a big way. With farmers in distress we chose not prevent them. We asked them to get in touch with the farmers directly and carry out the cultivation if they agree,"" Hazra said."
10,10,Congress blames Mamata for farmers' plight,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/congress-blames-mamata-for-farmers-plight/article2776569.ece,2012-01-05,The Hindu,"The State Congress on Wednesday called for a State-wide agitation against the Trinamool Congress-led government for its failure to improve the condition of farmers in the State, some of whom have committed suicide.On Tuesday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had put the blame on the Centre and claimed that neither could she raise the minimum support price of crops for farmers nor reduce the prices of fertilisers.At a demonstration to highlights the concerns of farmers, Congress leaders said that the lacuna lies in the implementation of the State Government and not in the Centre's policies, which are the same for all the States. The crisis faced by the farmers is that they are not getting the minimum support price of Rs. 1080 per quintal fixed by the Centre. The government does not have any mechanism to buy the produce from the farmers, said West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee President Pradip Bhattacharya.Mr. Bhattacharya explained that when farmers have to sell their produce at rice mills and are authorised to get the payments only through cheques, they are forced to sell their produce to local agents at a lower price. He directed Congress workers to hold demonstrations in front of the offices all district magistrates during the month to highlight the issue.The State Government has fixed a procurement target of 20-lakh metric tonnes of food grains, but so far just a little over two-lakh metric tonnes have been procured, State Irrigation Minister Manas Bhunia said.Pointing out the shortcomings of the State Government in its management in the agriculture sector, Mr. Bhunia also said that of the 1018 rice mills in the State, 350 are closed. He added that the public distribution system, through its 28,873 ration shops, was not functioning well.Congress MP Deepa Dasmunshi alleged that farmers are selling paddy at a far lower price than they used to sell during the Left Front Government. While the farmers used to sell (one quintal of paddy) for Rs.700 to Rs.800 during the Left Front's rule, today under the government of ma, mati, manush , they are forced to sell the same produce for Rs.500 to 600, she said.Jute cultivators and potato growers were also being forced into distress sales of their produce, the Congress leaders said.Criticising the Trinamool Congress opposition to foreign direct investment in the retail sector, the State Congress leadership alleged that the party has deprived farmers of the opportunity to get higher prices for their produce."

It was 21 per cent in the corresponding week of 2010. This was the first time the food price index has declined since April 2006.The fall in food prices have been substantial since the first week of November, when food inflation stood at double-digits. Experts attributed the decline to the high base of the previous year and to good kharif output.Food inflation has turned negative on the favourable impact of lower food prices and elevated base effect. It is probable that food inflation might remain subdued till mid-February, Standard Chartered economist Anubhuti Sahay said.According to official data, onion became cheaper by 73.74 per cent year-on-year during the week, while potato prices were down 34.01 per cent.

Since 2010, the 53-year-old farmer has not been able to recover the cost of cultivating potatoes on 5,000 acres of land. The reason: a glut production and no space in cold storages across Punjab.In 2010, I recovered only 80% of the cost of production and in 2011 I managed to get back only 50% in spite of a bumper crop, a distraught Sangha told HT. There are 6,000 tonnes of crop in my cold storage alone.Potato is grown on nearly 80,000 hectares in Punjab, primarily in the Doaba belt  area between Sutlej and Beas rivers that comprises of Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr and Hoshiarpur districts.With a bumper harvest this season as well, prices of potatoes have hit an all-time low of R1 per kg. Farmers say that due to increased farming input costs, growing potato costs them at least Rs 5 per kg.Farmers also feel the governments freight subsidy of 50 paise per kg for transportation within the country and Rs 1.50 for export is too meagre.Fresh crop is ready for arrival and the government has left us in the lurch with no solution to clear up the piled stock. I am sending my crop to Guwahati, but I cant even recover the cost of freight, Sangha said.Sangha has urged the Central Potato Board to protect the interests of potato farmers by encouraging versatile use of the tuber crop."
15,15,Food prices drop for first time in 6 years,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Food-prices-drop-for-first-time-in-6-years/articleshow/11380946.cms,2012-01-06,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Food inflation turned negative for the first time in nearly six years in late December as prices of vegetables, potato, onion and some cereals fell sharply, prompting analysts to say the data provided headroom for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates and support growth.Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Thursday showed food inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index, fell by 3.36%  sharply lower than the previous week's 0.42%. It stood at 20.84% in the same year-ago period.Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said there was substantial improvement in the food inflation situation. ""Food inflation has turned negative for the first time in recent memory,"" he told reporters.Thursday's data showed vegetable prices fell by 50.22% year-on-year while potato prices declined an annual 34.01%. Onion prices which had shot up last year fell by 73.74% year-on-year. Wheat prices declined an annual 3.41%. But price of pulses firmed up an annual 13.85% during the week under review.C Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, said he expects the overall inflation to ease below 7% by end-March. Policymakers have been wrong-footed several times in the past two years while predicting the inflation trend.""We have to wait for December inflation figures to see if the non-food manufacturing numbers have also followed the same path. The December numbers will indicate when and how RBI will act,"" he told reporters. ""The environment appears to be in favour of the Reserve Bank reversing its monetary policy stance,"" he said.Soaring food prices for more than one year have hit household budgets and contributed significantly to overall inflation which has hovered around double-digits.Economists said the decline in food inflation was largely due to a statistical base effect but also showed that supplies had improved significantly.""The supplies have been relatively better. We expect December inflation around 7.5% and expect the RBI to first reduce the cash reserve ratio in its January policy and then follow it up with a rate cut over the next two-three months,"" said Samiran Chakraborty, economist at Standard Chartered Bank. Overall inflation in November remained above the 9% mark and data for December is expected next week.Stubborn inflation had forced the RBI to raise interest rates 13 times since last March. It announced a pause in its tightening cycle in the recent policy review. The central bank has said its strategy may now change to supporting growth if there is significant evidence of inflation easing. Analysts and bankers expect the RBI to cut rates soon. The economy is expected to grow around 7.5%, sharply slower than the previous estimate of over 9%.The index for food articles group declined by 0.2% to 190.0 from 190.3 for the previous week due to lower prices of jowar, fruits and vegetables, gram and moong (1% each). But prices of chicken (3%), egg, ragi and maize (2% each) moved up.The data also showed that prices of fruits, milk, egg, meat and fish prices remained stubborn. Protein-based items have remained stubborn due to rising demand and economists say they still remain as pressure points.""The trend of sharp decline in food inflation has increased the probability of interest rate cuts,"" said D K Joshi, chief economist at ratings agency Crisil.The government is exulting in the fact that food inflation has consistently seen a downward swing in recent times. It has now slumped further to settle at -3.36%. Yet the benefits haven't percolated down to the consumers, who are at the receiving end of retail bullying. They are now questioning the significance of an index that fails to reflect ground reality.Food prices in October and November, Delhiites say, were so high that a marginal drop in December made no difference to their lives. Moreover, depending on where they stay and who they buy their vegetables from, Delhiites will be spending differently on the same food.Rama Ghosh, a resident of CR Park, says other than onions and potatoes, all other vegetables either cost the same as they did in November, or there is a very minute difference in their prices. ""I buy vegetables in Govindpuri where the prices have always been lower and the fall in rates has also been sharper,"" she says.Anita Singh of east Delhi claims prices have come down sharply since November. ""I've been buying cauliflower for Rs 20 per kilo,"" she says. But Ruma Roy from Gulmohar Park disagrees. She has been purchasing cauliflower for Rs 30 per kilo, ""a preposterous price for a winter vegetable"".""Wholesale prices in December 2011 were much lower compared to prices in December 2010. Even now, prices are lower than what they were a month ago, but retailers continue to milk consumers for what they are worth,"" says an official of Azadpur mandi.With prices of several commodities having gone up in 2011, including fuel, milk, dairy products and LPG, consumers say that a minor drop in vegetable prices goes almost unnoticed. ""I don't know whether such marginal reduction in prices should be highlighted by the government. In fact, if prices of potatoes and onions have reduced, the prices of other items are going up. People cannot eat only potatoes. Dal specially is very expensive  Chana dal is about Rs 70 per kg. I have five children at home. Do you think we can manage our expenses like this? We often fail to give children the kind of food they want to eat,"" says Saroj Chalia, a resident of Rohini.Many feel that the claims of the government or economists have not translated to any benefit for the consumer. ""These are mere claims. There is hardly any change in prices. Rather, the change is so small that it doesn't matter. I think the pricing of food products also depends on the area. I am a resident of Vasant Kunj in south Delhi. It is very expensive to shop there. Arhar dal, for instance, is Rs 80 per kg. We have to compromise on our purchases as we are not able to buy all kinds of dal,"" says Shefali Mishra, a DU professor.Rajan Sachdev, owner of a grocery store at INA, feels the difference is too marginal to count. "" The change in prices is so slight that the common man doesn't realize. I also feel that the prices of essentials are skyrocketing. If not potatoes and onions, take into account pulses and lentils. Do you think the poor can survive like this?"" he says."
16,16,Food inflation in negative territory,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/food-inflation-in-negative-territory/article2779098.ece,2012-01-06,The Hindu,"For the first time in nearly six years, food inflation entered negative territory, plunging to (-) 3.36 during the week ended December 24 from 0.42 per cent in the previous week, mainly owing to a sharp dip in prices of onions, potatoes and other seasonal vegetables.The slump into the negative zone for the first time as per the available WPI (wholesale price index) food inflation data with 2004-05 as the base year appears to have paved the way for a much-awaited cut in key rates by the Reserve Bank of India during its next monetary policy review slated for January 24.High base effectThis is despite the fact that the sharp decline is partly owing to the effect of a high base as food inflation during the like week in 2010 was at a high of 21 per cent. Nevertheless, enthused by the respite from high food prices, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said: There has been substantial improvement. Food inflation has turned negative for the first time in the recent memory.''The figures speak for themselves.As per the official data released here on Thursday, onion prices slumped by 73.74 per cent during the week while potatoes also turned cheaper by 34.01 per cent on a year-on-year basis.Prices of vegetables, on the whole, fell by 50.22 per cent, as did wheat by 3.41 per cent.Compared to prices of edibles during the first week of November when food inflation stood pegged at double digits, the slide in prices has been substantial.Policy stanceCommenting on the WPI data, Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) Chairman C. Rangarajan said: The environment appears to be in favour of the RBI reversing its monetary policy stance.Dr. Rangarajan viewed that the decline in food inflation would also help bring down headline inflation  which factors in manufactured items, fuels and non-food primary articles  to below 7 per cent by March this year.Evidently, having hiked interest rates 13 times since March last year, followed by a pause in December, the stage is set for the Reserve Bank of India to cut its key policy rates so as to induce overall consumer demand and spur industrial growth."

Criticising the government for failing on both the sectors,agriculture and industries,he said: The government has taken the state backward in both industry and agriculture  It has not taken a single step towards industrialisation compared to what was done by us. No new industry has come up under the new regime, said the CPM leader while addressing a party rally here.He claimed that industries like JSW steel,Wipro,Infosys and Cognizant had set foot in the state during the Left Front rule,but now investors are realising that this government will not do anything to bring new industry.Bhattacharjee said that although there had been a good harvest of aman paddy this season,the cultivators could not sell the produce because neither the government nor the cooperatives were buying the crops.I recently went to Burdwan. There,the paddy growers are running from pillar to post trying to sell their harvest. Even if they can,they are getting Rs 600 to 700 per quintal,instead of the MSP of Rs 1,100, Bhattacharjee said.He said farmers are also reluctant to go for potato and boro cultivation for fear that they would not be able to sell their produce.Although the erstwhile Left Front government had taken steps to buy jute at Rs 4,000 per quintal,the price now stands at Rs 2,000. Why is this? No one seems to know and no one is doing anything. Ministers are giving differing statements. This has never happened when we were in the government, Bhattacharjee said.On the recent incidents of violence in some colleges in the state,Bhattacharjee alleged that law and order is on the brink of a breakdown under the present government.The CPM leader also found fault with the signing of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) agreement in Darjeeling,initiated by the Mamata Banerjee government,saying it would only boost the demand for Gorkhaland and not bring development of any sort.There is no reason to think that agitators would abandon the demand for Gorkhaland with the signing of the GTA agreement. It will only foment the demand. Darjeeling is sitting on a powder keg. It will erupt any day, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

This was the lowest reading since December 2009 when it stood at 7.15%.The sharp moderation in inflation comes as a huge relief for policymakers who have been battling stubborn price pressures since 2010.

We maintain our view that the RBI will likely cut rates after the federal budget (mid-March),"" said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at CLSA in Singapore.""However, a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) should not be totally ruled out because of the need for a sustainable solution to address the excessively tight money market liquidity situation,"" Malik said.

The crisis is likely to aggravate in March when the potato crop is reaped.But even as price woes and a potato crop damaged by unseasonal rains wreak havoc on the farming sector, chief minister Mamata Banerjee isn't ready to buy the logic that farmers are committing suicide because they aren't getting value for their produce. ""Not a single farmer died due to it. The deaths of 12 persons were due to personal problems with their personal debts running into crores,"" the chief minister said on Thursday. Drawing a contrast with farmer deaths during the Left rule, she pointed out a total of 199 farmers committed suicide in 2008-09 while the toll in 2009-10 was 179.But the father of 35-year-old Sushanta Ghosh, who drank pesticide on Wednesday night and passed away at Burdwan Medical College Hospital in the wee hours of Thursday , had a different story to tell. Sushanta, a farmer at Hetti village in Burdwan's Galsi, was the sole bread-earner in his six-member family  wife, two sons and parents. It wasn't hunger that killed him but the bales of unsold paddy piled up outside his home.The family of Sushanta Ghosh, the farmer who committed suicide at Galsi in Burdwan on Thursday, has bales of paddy piled up at their home. His father Bikash could not sell the paddy because of the low market price. ""My son made a distress sale of some of the produce, but the money was not enough to go for the potato cultivation. He had a loan burden of Rs 2 lakh, of which he owed Rs 60,000 to the local SBI branch, another Rs 35,000 to the local cooperative bank and the remaining Rs 1.05 lakh he borrowed from a local mahajan at high interest rate. The debt burden kept piling up as he didn't get the right price for paddy, potato and mustard ,"" Bikash said.The anxiety didn't build up in a day. Sushanta cultivated the aman paddy and then boro on his own 7-bigha land, and tilled another eight bighas last year. But the yield didn't fetch the price to meet the loan amount. He borrowed again to cultivate potato on a much smaller 7-cottah plot and grew mustard on 5 cottahs. ""But the untimely rain damaged the potato and mustard plants,"" Bikash said.Cousin Debnarayan Ghosh pointed out that Sushanta tried to clear a portion of his debt by selling part of the paddy stocks at Rs 500 a quintal. ""He was depressed . There is no other problem in the family other than the rising debt burden. I beg to the state government to write off his loan and compensate the family,"" he said.Galsi Block II BDO Barsharani Basu sent two officers to Sushanta's village to find out the reason behind the suicide. ""I am waiting for a detailed report from the officers before I comment on the cause of death,"" he said. Incidentally, the Galsi is the largest rice producing block in the country.Local Trinamool leader Prasanta Kundu claimed that Sushanta was more into trading than farming. ""He suffered due to callous potato trading. It has nothing to do with farming,"" Kundu said. Another Trinamool leader Basanta Chowdhury said: ""Sushanta was a potato trader. He was upset because somebody borrowed Rs 25,000 from him and didn't repay it when he needed the money most.""CPM's Galsi zonal secretary Faiaz Rahman said he knew Sushanta personally. ""He took loans from the SBI and the local cooperative, but could not afford to take further loans during rabi cultivation. There has been 12 such deaths in Burdwan district so far,"" Rahman said.Taking feedbacks through party channel, the CM said: ""Do not teach me anything on this. Why are they angry? Is it because my government has stopped paying in cash? The cadres now are unable to give a 50% cut to their party and keep the rest with them. The comrades have stopped earning,"" the CM said.Mamata took her attack a notch further when she held a ""Burdwan group"" which she named, ""Dhan Kore Khoaya Committee"" of receiving kickbacks over rice procurement from farmers.Leader of the opposition Surjya Kanta Mishra said: ""We've repeatedly provided the details of 23 farmers who've committed suicide. I will visit some of these families, the government can also inquire. Do all panchayats have banks?"" On the corruption allegations, he said, ""She has ordered inquiry into a 40-year-old case, why isn't she investigating this?""With an eye on the panchayat polls, Mamata said, ""350 cold storage's will be build. Efforts are on to export potato to Indonasia. Funds to the beneficiary of 100-day work scheme would be paid on a daily basis, instead of the three-week period ."" Mishra said, ""There are enough cold storages in the state. And why Indonesia? She can as well sell these potatoes to the Kolkata market."""

Untrue reports are being published in the media, he said.Mr. Panda said the delegation tried to convince her of the need for forming an all-party MLA team, referring to the concern voiced by Governor M.K. Narayanan.When we urged the Chief Minister to increase the Rs.50,000-crore loan ceiling for small and marginal farmers, she told us that this was a matter that would have to be decided by banks. Moreover, she asked how they would repay the loans, he said. We told her that it should be ascertained whether such suicides were due to the distress sale of paddy and other agricultural produce by the farmers in different parts of the State.He said the delegation submitted a nine-point memorandum to her and pointed out that the prices of potatoes and other agricultural produce had come down in markets across the State owing to distress sales.Mr. Panda said the delegation requested the Chief Minister to provide an economic package to the affected marginal farmers and families of the peasants who reportedly committed suicide, arguing that they should also be given compensation and their agricultural debts waived.The delegation wanted the government to reach food and other essentials to the distressed families through the Public Distribution System.On Monday, Mr. Narayanan said the issue was engaging the attention of both the State government and the Centre, and there was a need to find ways of stopping such incidents."

Many of them were priced below Rs.20 a kg. I am also purchasing lot of seasonal vegetables as they have turned cheaper.Green peas, usually sold for Rs.80-100 a kg, were priced at Rs.25. Cabbage and cauliflowers were also priced around Rs.10 a kg. Many customers like Vimala Jayapal of Tiruvottiyur, however, felt that some of the frequently used vegetables such as brinjal and ladies fingers continued to remain out of reach, priced around Rs.50 a kg.V.R.Soundararajan, a wholesale trader, said: We expect the prices to dip further as the market is receiving nearly 50 more lorries than the usual 350 lorries daily. Some of the locally grown vegetables such as brinjals, drumsticks and ladies fingers were expensive in view of the damage to produce in the Thane cyclone.S.Srinivasan, president of Chennai Fruit Commission Agents Association, said that the market would start receiving oranges from Maharashtra in February. Fewer arrivals of apples from Himachal Pradesh also led to increase in the cost.While apples cost Rs.150 per kg, oranges are priced nearly Rs.40 a kg. Pomegranates cost Rs.80 a kg. There has been a sharp rise in the cost owing to escalating transportation charges.I have to pay Rs.32,000 for a lorry trip from Maharashtra now. Earlier, the charges were Rs.25,000 per trip, he added."

However, statistically, much of the decline in the price spiral was owing to the effect of a high base as food inflation during the like week in January 2011 was at a high of over 17 per cent.Ostensibly, it is on account of the high base effect that food inflation is expected to remain in negative zone for some more time during the current fiscal and contribute to the anticipated decline in headline inflation to 7 per cent by the end of March. Once the base effect impact on the inflation data wears off some time by the end of February, food inflation is likely to bounce back to positive territory.However, such seven-day comparisons in food inflation will soon not be feasible any more as the government has decided to do away with the practice of releasing weekly WPI data on primary food articles and fuel as the numbers were not presenting a holistic picture of the price scenario. With the Union Cabinet opting for a switch to the earlier system, the government will continue to release only a monthly WPI headline inflation data containing the break-up for all segments of goods, including food and non-food articles, fuel and manufactured items.The change, however, is in keeping with global norms. Doing away with the weekly inflation data would mean that the volatility associated with week-on-week variations would cease to cause concern. Globally also, it is the norm to give inflation numbers on a monthly basis, Crisil's chief economist D. K. Joshi said.Especially owing to a drop in food prices, headline inflation in December slipped from near double-digit levels during the major part of 2011 to a two-year low of 7.47 per cent in December.As per the weekly data, the maximum fall was in the prices of onions by 79.10 per cent year-on-year, followed by potatoes which turned cheaper by 22.46 per cent even as the decline in prices of vegetables overall was to the extent of 47.06 per cent.Wheat prices were also down 3.37 per cent.

63,63,Jan inflation at 2-year low of 6.55 per cent,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/227071/jan-inflation-2-year-low.html,2012-02-14,Deccan Herald,"New Delhi, Feb 14,2012,DHNS : 21:55 ISTFM sees situation to ease by March-endInflation, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), stood at 7.47 per cent in December 2011. It was 9.47 per cent in January last year.The latest numbers are the lowest since November, 2009 when the inflation was 4.73 per cent.As per the data, food inflation was (-) 0.52 per cent in January against 0.74 per cent in December. Food inflation fell into the negative zone on account of cheaper vegetables, like potato and onion whose prices fell by 23.15 per cent and 75.57 per cent, respectively, on annual basis.The fall in inflation to a two-year low also raised Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjees hope it would stabilise around 6 per cent by March end. He, however, said that inflation at the current level was not acceptable. I now expect that the March-end 2012 inflation will be closer to 6 per cent, Mukherjee told reporters here.Analysts said the fall in inflation raises hope of a decent economic growth and ease in price pressure on common man in coming times.The annual inflation fell on the back of cooling food inflation which moved to -0.52 per cent from 0.74 per cent in December.However, prices of protein-rich food items such as eggs, fish and meat, milk and pulses remained high, suggesting that food inflation remained a potential pressure point.However, prices of manufactured items, which have a weight of around 65 per cent in the WPI basket, continued to be a cause for concern. Manufactured inflation stood at 6.49 per cent year-on-year in January, as against 7.41 per cent in the previous month.Fuel prices rose 14.21 per cent from a year earlier, compared with an annual rise of 14.91 per cent in December.The steady fuel inflation pointed towards political considerations that have forced the government to delay an adjustment in petroleum and coal prices. Policymakers said lowering of inflation also made a case forthe Reserve Bank of India to cut rates.Last month, the RBI signaled readiness to lowering rates if inflation eased further. It has, however, cited risks to inflation from global crude oil prices and the weak rupee, as well as India's growing fiscal deficit. The impact of Europes debt crisis has also added to risks, with a trade deficit expected to rise to $160 billion in 2011-12, threatening renewed pressure on rupee.Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said: I hope that we will be able to keep inflation under control in coming months. Inflation for November 2011 has been revised upwards to 9.46 per cent from provisional estimate of 9.11 per cent."
65,65,Inflation eases to 6.55 per cent in January,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/inflation-eases-to-655-per-cent-in-january/article2894383.ece,2012-02-15,The Hindu,"Much to the government's respite, headline inflation eased to a 26-month low at 6.55 per cent in January from 7.47 per cent in December, 2011, owing to a further fall in vegetable prices, prompting Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee to scale the benchmark lower at 6 per cent from the earlier estimate of 7 per cent for the fiscal year ending March.With overall inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), witnessing a sharper-than-expected fall in January, 2012, from 9.47 per cent in the same month last year, Mr. Mukherjee expressed cautious optimism on further moderation in the coming months though he felt that softening in the prices of manufactured goods, despite the rapid decline in non-food primary inflation, may be more gradual.I think it [headline inflation] should be further reduced since it is still not at the acceptable level ... [I] now expect that the March-end 2012 inflation will be closer to 6 per cent, Mr. Mukherjee said while pointing to concerns over the price trend of other commodities such as edible oils, milk and protein-based items which could stoke inflation yet again.The main worry going forward is on edible oils, milk and some animal proteins which may continue to threaten food inflation, as the required institutional reforms in agricultural marketing and improvement in storage and cold chains will operate with a lag  these are areas where States have to take a lead and take advantage of Central government initiatives  announced in the last two Union budgets, he said.The Finance Minister's worry on this count is not misplaced. The WPI data show that food inflation was in negative zone at (-) 0.52 per cent in January owing to cheaper vegetables such as potatoes and onions, which were down 23.15 per cent and 75.57 per cent, respectively, year-on-year. However, prices of edible oils and milk during the month were up 9.59 per cent and 12.6 per cent, respectively, while that of eggs, meat and fish was still higher by 18.63 per cent on a yearly basis. Moreover, manufactured goods, which account for a weight of about 65 per cent in the WPI basket, continued to cost more. As per the data, inflation in manufactured items stood pegged at 6.49 per cent in January year-on-year, as against 7.41 per cent in the previous month. Inflation in overall primary articles, however, stood lower at 2.25 per cent during the month as compared to 3.07 per cent in December, while in non-food primary articles, it moderated to 0.55 per cent from 1.48 per cent in the previous month. In such a scenario, as to whether the Reserve Bank of India will go ahead with a cut in interest rates during its mid-quarterly review next month remains a question mark."

Chidambaram saying it could decline further in the coming months.The declining trend might trigger an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to boost economic growth which fell to 5.4 per cent in the first-half of the current fiscal from 7.3 per cent in the year-ago period.The decline in inflation during November from 7.45 per cent a month ago and 9.46 per cent in the corresponding month a year ago can be attributed to falling prices of certain vegetables.Encouraged by falling inflation, Mr. Chidambaram expressed the confidence that it would moderate further in the next two to three months.Inflation is a challenge. Inflation worries the government. While CPI (consumer price index) inflation is sticky, good news is that the wholesale price index-based (WPI) inflation seems to be trending downwards...If it trends downwards, there will be some reason for comfort, he said during a discussion in Parliament.Vegetable prices decreased by 1.19 per cent in November this year as compared to surge of 10.68 per cent in same month a year ago.However, prices of some food items such as potato, wheat, cereals, rice, pulses, edible oil and sugar went up during the period.It is a welcome trend if inflation rate has come down... We should work towards more comfortable level of inflation which is 5-6 per cent, Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council Chairman C. Rangarajan said.Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia termed moderation in inflation as a very good signal.Food inflationFood inflation, as a category in the WPI, rose to 8.5 per cent during the month, from 8.32 per cent a year ago. Though vegetables, in general, registered a decline, potato and onion prices, however, shot up by 72.20 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively, year-on-year in November this year.

340,340,From farm gate to your plate,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/from-farm-gate-to-your-plate/article4205641.ece,2012-12-16,The Hindu,"The retail vegetable sellers have now started quoting the prices of almost all items in pao or 250 grammes. The concept of darjan or dozen has almost been replaced by the kilogramme for the humblest of fruits like bananas and oranges. But this means little to the common household which now literally thinks twice before buying any grocery item.A common refrain heard often from politicians is that prices are spiralling. But how this phenomenon -- where the prices of food products in Delhi are now matching those in developed countries like the United States -- has come to such a pass is a matter of real concern.A major cause for this is the difference in rates between wholesale markets and retail outlets in Delhi. The nearly 100 per cent jump in the case of most items is to be blamed. So while potatoes sold at a modal rate of Rs.5.97 per kg in the Azadpur wholesale market on Tuesday, it was selling at an Easy Day outlet in Rohini at Rs.10 per kg, at the Mother Dairy outlet there at Rs.11.90 per kg and at the Thursday market at Rs.15 per kg.Farmers in Punjab recently threw potatoes on the roads as they were not even getting Re.1 per kg for their produce. But here in Delhi the price has not dropped below Rs.15 in the open market even for a day, rues Rupa Srikumar, who now compares prices at different outlets before making purchases.Across the city at Mayur Vihar in East Delhi, Kumud Suri now juggles with her monthly expenses to ensure a healthy diet for her family. The price of eggs has gone up to Rs.50 a dozen for regular size and Rs.70 for the desi variety; bananas here sell for Rs.35 per kg and work out to over Rs.50 per dozen; while potatoes sell for between Rs.15 and Rs.20 per kg; all this is too high for this time of the year.A closer look at the way in which the Indian market functions reveals the cause for the variation. Much of it has to do with the presence of numerous middlemen, transportation costs, bribes paid along the way and inability of most farmers to either cold-chain or preserve food items for long only adds to the yawning gap at which he sells the produce at his gate and the amount the final buyer pays to the retailer.If a farmer is selling something for Rs.100, say onions in Nasik, then by the time it reaches the consumer, the price usually goes up to anywhere between Rs.200 and Rs.250, said an office-bearer of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee, Delhi.The small farmer usually sells at the farm to the locals, and the big ones usually carry their produce to the local mandi or the closest city mandi , the APMC member said. The increase in price between the farm and the local mandi is around 10 per cent. And this includes the 2 per cent (for pulses) to 5 per cent (for fruits and vegetables) commission; and the half to four per cent market fee (1 per cent in Delhi).Incidentally, in Delhi the government collects Rs.80 crore per annum through this fees and almost Rs.60 crore comes from Azadpur, with the three other wholesale markets at Ghazipur, Keshopur and Okhla contributing the rest. Delhi, however, grows very little on its own.Between the local mandi and the small city mandi, another 15 per cent hike in rates comes about and about 3 to 4 per cent of this is due to transportation and labour costs and about 5 per cent is due to packaging and grading. The rest is commission of the agents.From the small city wholesale markets to Delhi, the cost increase is another 10 per cent. Of this Rs.1.50 (from nearby cities in Haryana or U.P.) to Rs.4 per kg (from Bangalore or West Bengal) is the transportation cost. Apart from this there is 6 per cent commission which is charged by the wholesalers, 1 per cent goes towards market fees and 3 per cent is other expenditure, including labour.So on a compounding basis, by the time a Rs.100 product leaves Delhis wholesale markets it already costs Rs.160. From here the product moves to either a retail seller who may be a rehri (cart) or patri (pavement) seller; institutional buyers like canteens and hotels; or semi-wholesaler who breaks it into smaller packs for the small vendors.While the retail sellers charge a 80 to 100 per cent profit, the semi-wholesalers jack up the rates by another 55 to 60 per cent. There is weight loss along the way due to repeated weighing and pilferage etc. and that too is factored into the prices, said the market expert. The APMC regulates the commission at the wholesale markets to a maximum 6 per cent.The concept of hoarding does not apply to these vegetables and fruits, for they are perishable items. It is the competition among the traders which regulates the rates, he says."
