0,Horticulture crop output seen at record 305.4 mt in 2017-18,http://www.livemint.com/Politics/V7EcEZlz9jT3bjLsyoiSpK/Horticulture-crop-output-seen-at-record-3054-mt-in-201718.html,2018-01-02,Livemint,"Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year. Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: Production of horticulture crops like vegetables and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years average, the agriculture ministry said in its first advance estimates released on Tuesday.The final estimates for 2016-17 released alongside showed that production of these perishable crops was 300.6 mt, a year-on-year rise of over 5%.Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year.Data showed that during the year, area under different perishable crops stood at 24.9 million hectares, about 0.3% higher than the year before. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, productivity of horticulture crops rose from 11.7 tonnes per hectare to an estimated 12.3 tonnes per hectare.Disaggregated data on estimates of production of specific crops showed onions at 21.4 mt, about 4.5% lower than the year before, and potatoes at 49.3 mt, marginally higher than the 48.6 mt in 2016-17. Production of tomatoes is estimated to rise 7.7% year-on-year in 2017-18 to 22.3 mt, showed the data.The record production during 2017-18 will mark the sixth straight year of horticulture production outstripping that of foodgrains (estimated at 276mt in 2016-17), suggesting a structural change in Indian agriculture where farmers are increasingly growing perishable commercial crops due to a growing market and a quicker cash flow as these crops require less time from sowing to marketing.However, price volatility continues to be a major risk in horticulture, with prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes plunging below growing costs several times last year. While farmers in Madhya Pradesh were forced to sell onions as low as Rs2 per kg in June last year, in northern India, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were forced to dump their potato crop for want of buyers around the same time.Retail and wholesale prices of perishables are also at a large variance from each other, implying fragmented markets and poor cold chain facilities. For instance, while tomatoes are currently selling for as low as Rs2-4 per kg in wholesale markets in Andhra Pradesh, they are retailing at Rs35 per kg in Delhi."

He said farmers were no longer willing to grow the crop.Replying to him, the Minister said the Rabi crop saw a 1% decline in area sown this year but the actual figures would be known later as sowing was still going on. He expressed confidence that the overall area was likely to remain the same.Mr. Jhakhar was joined by other colleagues who wanted to know the steps the government had taken to help the growers. Mr. Singh said no minimum support price had been fixed but the Centre and the States resorted to the market intervention scheme (MIS) to ensure that farmers could recover their input costs in case of glut.BJP member from Amreli (Gujarat) Narayanbhai Kacchadiya highlighted the plight of the cotton growers because of inadequate prices. Pointing out that the farmer actually got about Rs. 900 against Rs. 1,200 for production for 20 kg, he wanted to know the steps taken to help the farmer.The Minister replied that the government was trying to ensure better prices and was committed to ensuring minimum support prices."
2,Considerable drop in skyrocketing prices of vegetables,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/rate-of-vegatable/articleshow/62358186.cms,2018-01-04,The Times Of India,"Indore: A considerable drop in skyrocketing prices of tomato has given a reason to the homemakers to rejoice as once hitting a high of Rs 80/kg in last six months, the essential and perishable commodity of every kitchen has fallen to Rs 10/kg in wholesale market in last around two weeks.Bumper production of tomato and arrival of new crop from Maharashtra are the reasons behind its slashed rate. The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and its available at Rs 15-20 in retail market, Choithram Sabjimandi Kalyan Sangh secretary Nikhil Hardiya told TOI.He said that as crops supply is expected to reduce, tomatos rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in Choithram wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg, Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.He said that a few weeks ago, potatos wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate, Garg said.Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg Garg said."

But has the income of farmers increased? No, Kalyan said, adding that during his visits to agriculture universities in Rajasthan, he has appealed that scientists undertake crop awareness programmes among farmers so that they dont face glut in the harvesting season.It pains to see tomatoes being thrown on roads, potatoes dumped in cold storages and sugar cane burnt in fields as farmers are not getting remunerative prices for their produce, he said.Another issue he is going to take up is the low standard of the political discourse in the country.I would not name any leader or party but the way some leaders have uttered some below-the-belt remarks is not good for democracy, he said."

This has been the situation for the last three years.Mali said farmers are not even able to recover the transportation costs.Kachhwa said they are expecting at least 5 crore bags of fresh produce as the atmosphere for potato growing was very congenial.This is only going to cause a glut and aggravate our problem, member of Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sanghs executive committee Magan Patel said."
5,Bumper groundnut crop worries govt,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bumper-groundnut-crop-worries-govt/articleshow/62388375.cms,2018-01-06,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: With Indian Oilseed and Produce Export Promotion Council (IOPEPC) under union ministry of commerce estimating groundnut production of 32 lakh metric tonnes-the highest in the history of Gujarat- in 2017-18, the record production could spell fresh troubles for Vijay Rupani-led government in the state, which had faced a major political crisis over the minimum support price (MSP) of groundnut along with cotton during recently concluded assembly elections.Although the state government has procured 6.77 lakh tonnes of groundnut at MSP to ease farmers woes, the higher output has forced farmers to sell at a price lower than the MSP in local mandis. Industry players opine that bumper production could further put market prices under pressure as the government is only procuring quality groundnuts. On the other hand, oil millers, oilseed expellers and exporters are treading cautious in purchasing the commodity as they see Rs 800 per 20 kg as viable price for profitable business. The government is paying MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg.PALANPUR: Potato growers in north Gujarat are feeding huge quantities of tubers to cattle in gau shalas in Banaskantha. With prices falling to Rs two to Rs six per 20 kg and fresh arrivals expected from January 17, the farmers who stocked their produce are now selling the crop in distress. TNN P6The groundnut production for 2017-18 is higher by 2.5 lakh metric tonnes than 2016-17. Off late, the number of farmers coming to mandis to sell their groundnut crop at market rates has decreased as the state government is paying MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg. However, delay in payment has been the major concern and hence the farmers are forced to sell of their produce at a lower price. In the APMC, Rajkot, the price range was Rs 650 to Rs 850 on Friday, which was lower than the MSP, secretary, Agriculture Produce Market Committee , Rajkot, B R Tejani said.A secretary of another APMC said the MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg is not acceptable to the traders and hence they are refusing to buy at prices at par with MSP. Further, the quality of groundnut has also taken a beating this year.Director Agriculture B M Modi admitted that the government was only purchasing quality groundnut as there are set norms for purchase of crop at MSP and hence only those groundnut which complies with the norms was purchased by the government. Agriculture minister R C Faldu was not available for his comment. Amid bumper production, procurement at MSP was hampered due to finance issues earlier and now shortage of bags has adversely affected groundnut purchase at MSP.The new government in state had taken the issue very seriously soon after taking the charge. Even in the first cabinet meeting decision were taken to purchase groundnut at MSP.In order to ensure MSP for farmers and supply to industry players, Gujarat government should follow Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojna or price deficit finance scheme adopted by Madhya Pradesh government for soyabean procurement, whereby farmers sell commodity in open market and government pays farmers the differential amount between rates in mandis and MSP. This way, the industry gets supply, farmers get MSP price and the state government does not have to bother about storage of the commodity, executive director, the Solvent Extractors Association of India, BV Mehta said."

Adityanath, despite the jinx, went to Noida recently for the inauguration.Read: What Noida jinx, Modi asks as he praises Yogi AdityanathAkhilesh also asked Adityanath to call a cabinet meet on Monday and re-introduce Samajwadi Party Pension Yojana so that women could buy sweaters for their school-going children to whom the government could not provide school uniform sweaters.What can one expect from the government that failed to provide even sweaters to children? The BJP is the biggest party in the country with crores of members. Had each member of the party either weaved or provided a sweater each, then none of the children would have been without sweaters, he said.The BJP and the SP had engaged in a war of words over the state governments delay in distributing pullovers to 1.54 crore students of state-run primary and upper primary schools (up to class 8).

But the government is not looking at its own negligence that forced the farmers to do what they did.Referring at Adityanaths Himanchal Pradesh polls rallies, he said: He had announced there that government made arrangements for better prices to potato farmers. What happened to that?On the issue of saffron paint on UP Haj Committee offices boundary wall in Lucknow, the SP leader took a dig at the BJP, saying they turned jittery and overnight restored the original cream colour.The government should concentrate on changing the heart of people by doing development and welfare works than changing the colours of buildings, he said.When asked to respond on SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadavs comment that he will contest Lok Sabha polls from his original Mainpuri seat, Akhilesh said: He will contest the polls from whichever seat he wishes to. Entire party and I will rally behind him and for him to win.Mulayam had contested Mainpuri and Azamgarh seats in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. He won both, but vacated Mainpuri to let his grand-nephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav contest and win it.I know from where Tej Pratap will contest in that case, he said."

The farmers left behind pamphlets saying they were getting Rs 3-4 per kilo at government wholesale markets, and demanding ""Rs 10 a kilo"".Lucknow senior superintendent of police Deepak Kumar said the cops had identified the farmers involved and the vehicles in which they had brought the potatoes, and promised ""legal action soon"".No farmer organisation has claimed responsibility but Harnam Singh, a Bharatiya Kisan Union leader, said his group had ""met Adityanath recently to request him to look into farmers' problems but he did nothing"".The state is witnessing a potato glut. Singh said it cost Rs 5 to produce 1kg of potatoes, which means the farmers were losing Rs 1-2 per kilo at the wholesale markets.""The price in the retail market is Rs 20 for 2.5kg, which is less than the production and transport costs combined. Obviously, the farmers will express their anger on the streets,"" he said.Singh alleged that some BJP politicians had said at internal meetings that farmers were ""thieves playing into the hands of rival parties"".""We voted the BJP to power at the Centre in 2014 and in the state in 2017.

8,15% increase in potato production expected,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/15-increase-in-potato-production-expected/articleshow/62397878.cms,2018-01-07,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD/PALANPUR: Farmers and traders in Banaskantha are expecting a bumper potato crop. Though the acreage sown increased by 17%, output is expected to rise by 15% from last year.In Gujarat in 2017, potato production was 17.10 lakh metric tonnes (MT), making up nine per cent of the countrys output. If market sources are to be believed, this figure will cross 19 lakh MT this year. After groundnut, the government will face a huge task to handle potato farmer, keeping in mind that in 2017 farmers were forced to dump potatoes in the streets, because they were getting meagre prices, an officer at APMC Deesa said.Fearing that farmers will not get remunerative prices this year too, Deesa APMC chairman Mavjibhai Desai wrote to the state government and met the new agriculture minister, R C Faldu With the area sown increasing we are expecting a bumper crop this year too. I have asked the state government to work out an action plan to bail out farmers who may not get proper prices for their produce. I even met Faldu. Desai said that the new crop has started trickling in but will be in full flow in 15 days.The price of new potatoes was around Rs 6 a kg at Deesa market, while old potatoes, which had been kept in cold storage is Rs 2 a kg. Satish Mali, the owner of a cold storage in Banaskantha, said the new crop is while there is still stock in cold storage. He said he still has 200 tons of old potatoes and the farmers or traders are not answering his the calls. We pay Rs 100 as loan for a 50kg bag to farmers, to meet packing, labour and transportation expenses. When the produce is sold the loan is recovered along with rent. A farmer incurs a cost of Rs 5 per kg to put potatoes in cold storage. Presently, they cant even recoup their input costs, so they dont turn up to claim their stored stock. We are just getting Rs 1.5 per kg against the input cost of Rs 5 at the moment.Kalubhai Ratnabhai, a farmer, says, Last year I got Rs 4 per kg and was expecting the price to rise further. I didnt sell my crop and am now not even getting a price that will match my storage cost, leave aside other input costs. If potatoes are in cold storage after October, that person is required to pay Rs 2.6 per kg. He further said that he opted to sow grow potatoes this year too, as it is cheaper, in terms of input cost, than others crops.Mavjibhai Patel, a trader from Deesa, said he had stored about 5,000 50-kg bags and in the last month he only got an average of Rs 3 per kg. He said that this was lower than what he paid the farmers."

A State government spokesperson, however, dismissed the incident as the handiwork of miscreants.There was a truck which had sacks of potato, which were thrown from it in various parts of the city early this morning. So far no farmers group has claimed responsibility for this act. This seems to be the work of antisocial elements... We are probing all possible angles, said Lucknow District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma.He added that the potatoes were thrown on Vidhan Sabha Marg, near VVIP guest house and near the 1090 Crossing. The roads were then cleaned by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation.Pre-planned actToday it is the potato farmers who have thrown potatoes on the streets of Lucknow, tomorrow it may be the sugarcane farmers, the wheat and paddy farmers if the situation does not improve, said Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit.State Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi called it a pre-planned act. The potatoes which were thrown were partly or completely rotten and rejected in the mandi (market). It is a deliberate attempt to malign the image of the Yogi Adityanath government, he said."

The state government dismissed the incident as the ""work of miscreants"".Potatoes were found strewn at WPL 1090 Crossing, Vidhan Sabha and Raj Bhawan. Three policemen, including a sub-inspector, were suspended on charges of negligence after the incident.Lucknow district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said potatoes were thrown from a truck but they were yet to ascertain who was responsible for the act. So far, no farmers' group has claimed responsibility.In Meerut, however, CM Aditya Nath Yogi said his was the first government to announce a minimum support price (MSP) for potatoes. ""If needed, we will raise it further,"" he said.Meanwhile, SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar suspended sub-inspector Pramod Kumar , constables Ankur Chaudhary and Ved Prakash deployed on night shift at Hazratganj police station and constables Komal Singh and Naveen Kumar of Gautampalli police station.Kumar has also formed a committee comprising ASP (east) and CO (Hazratganj) to probe the matter. ""We need to identify the truck seen in CCTV footage before we take action. We are also investigating if there is any anti-social element involved,"" said Kumar. Farmers in the city have expressed displeasure over government policy on potato produce.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) zonal president Hariram Verma said, We get only Rs 4 per kg from the sale in open market, while the cost of production is Rs 10 per kg. Why is the government not regulating the price?He also took a dig at the government for regulation of price even for people who get it for Rs 15-20 per kg despite an excessive produce.We will sit on an indefinite strike if the prices are not regulated; not only of potato but also sugarcane and other vegetables, said Verma.Uttar Pradesh agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi told reporters that the present state government was committed to the welfare of farmers, especially potato growers.

The plan never took shape.In 2015, then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had announced at a programme that least one vodka brewing factory would be set up in Kannauj and Farukkhabad districts each, which will ensure remunerative prices to farmers.While Akhilesh has represented Kannauj in Lok Sabha for two terms, his wife Dimple Yadav is serving her second term from the same constituency. Kannauj is part of UPs potato belt, along with Farrukahabad, Etawah, Mainpuri and Aligarh, stretching up to Meerut.With 31% production, UP is the largest producer of potato in the country and more than 8 lakh farmers plant potato every year, with production increasing every year.UP produces nearly 46 lakh million tonnes of potato a year in nearly 5 lakh hectares of area. Farmers, however, have no other platform except local mandis to sell their produce and trade some portion outside the state.Demonetisation and souring relationship with Pakistan have further dealt a blow to potato growers who were earlier able to get cash in hand by trading it off to other states and Pakistan.Unlike the adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana and far off Gujarat and Maharashstra, Uttar Pradesh does not have major food processing units to process.This leads to distress selling by growers in local markets at low prices and frequently dump produce on streets in anguish.Official records of the horticulture department reveal that the food processing industry in Uttar Pradesh is at the bottom as compared to any other state.While potato prices have touched an all-time low in the past two years, there was none to educate farmers to shift to other cash crops.Glut in the market in the past two years has resulted in farmers getting into distress, said RK Singh, senior scientist at Central Institute of Potato Research, Shimla.Farm crisis would not be solved unless the state government makes efforts for a food processing industry. Unfortunately, it has not developed in the state, said SK Shukla, principal scientist at the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture in Lucknow.Potato growers keep their produce dumped in cold storages for months as they cannot even afford the rent.If we collect the potato from cold storage and take it to the market, it would cost us Rs 30 a kg while potato is already available at Rs 5 to Rs 10 a kg in the market. This does not make economic sense, said Naresh Dixit, a regular potato grower in Unnao."
12,No takers for potato crop in Jagatsinghpur,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/jan/09/no-takers-for-potato-crop-in-jagatsinghpur-1748462.html,2018-01-09,The New Indian Express,"JAGATSINGHPUR: Lack of storage facilities and market linkage have taken a toll on potato cultivation in Jagatsinghpur district.Out of 98,000 hectares (ha) of cultivable land in the district, 86,850 ha are used for growing paddy while potato cultivation is being done in only 8.7 ha.Though the Horticulture department claimed to have convinced local farmers to carry out extensive cultivation of the crop, the latter are unwilling to take it up due to unavailability of marketing facilities. The district faced acute shortage of potatoes during October and December last year.The cold storage, which is run by Cooperative Society of Jagatsinghpur, is lying defunct since the last 20 years. Another private one at Raghunathpur has been closed due to the financial crisis, leaving the district with no cold storage at all.Earlier, the district administration had proposed the State Planning Board to renovate the cold storages on Public Private Partnership mode. However, nothing had been done in this regard so far.In such a scenario, the skyrocketing prices of potato would continue to affect the kitchens of commoners in the district, experts opined.Besides the man-made factors, the crops cultivation has also been hindered by natural challenges. Prevalence of low-lying areas in the region and untimely rains, which delayed paddy cultivation, have also affected the crop.On the other hand, farmers alleged that they were deprived of subsidies for growing potatoes on Government lands, including river beds. They insisted that potato crop fails to reap profit for them. Some of the cultivators are even planning to give up potato farming.The department had requested for 150 quintals of potato seeds. But we have received only 130.5 quintals so far. Despite announcing a subsidy of `15,000 per acre to each farmer, the latter are reluctant to cultivate potato, Assistant Director, Horticulture Mihir Samantray, said."
13,In an organic fashion...,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/in-an-organic-fashion/article22408611.ece,2018-01-10,The Hindu,"For someone who embraced ikat when Indian fashion was yet to find its feet, Madhu Jain has always been looking ahead of her times  first in 1980s when only a handful of designers would rummage for raw materials in the labyrinthine bylanes of the Walled City to now when designers have no compunction of procuring imported fabrics, accessories to economise cost of their outfits.As a precocious child, Madhu was quick to appreciate the aesthetic eyes of her father, who liked dressing up in his best bib and tucker and lived in regal style in posh Aurangzeb Road. Madhu meticulously studied everything  be it dcor, lifestyle, cuisine and heritage. Years later, that would reflect on her sartorial choices.She loves figurative work of Thai ikat and that translates into her food as well. As we meet at Zing, the Asian restaurant of The Metropolitan Hotel and Spa, she observes the large vegetarian spread aesthetically. After settling down, the food connoisseur in her comes alive as she inquires about erstwhile Siams Pamelo salad and raw papaya.Madhus dietary influence has come from Rajeshwari Devi, her mother, who hailed from a traditional Jain family of Kucha Bulaki Begum in Old Delhi. At home, mother would cook onion and garlic-free food which was so sumptuous. At school in Delhi, I would take tiffin in which she packed me lip smacking chana and puri. Surprisingly, she was enlisted as a non vegetarian at Welham Girls School in Dehradun. But, right from day one, I was adamant to stick to my vegetarian palate.B.D. Meattle, her father, was fond of fashionable clothes. And would gift floral French chiffon saris to her mother. She wore it with pearls. His aesthetics could be seen in Belgian chandeliers, Persian carpets at our home. The Walled City continues to be her favourite haunt for street food.  Jo khatir nawazi wahan hoti hai, kahin nahi hoti . At my nanis house in Old Delhi, khumchewalas would send banana leaves filled with kulfi, kulle, a fast disappearing edible, from which sweet potatoes and other veggies would be scooped out.Foraying into fashionHaving taken the bold decision of working on the ancient weaving technique of ikat even though she was a student of Economics, Madhu was not perturbed by the fact that Indians then had virtually no exposure to couture.I was lucky to be around the same time as Rohit Khosla. Those days camaraderie existed between designers. Today, it is rare to find two designers on the same page, she says, while sipping her hot and sour soup.Shehas remained loyal to the indigenous handmade crafts and textiles. Foreign buyers have a lot of respect for our handmade clothes but the problem is that only a few designers are presenting Indian art and craft in their totality abroad. Like when I took Kashmiri handicrafts to the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Americans were in awe of it. There needs to be responsible fashion and the idea of giving back to society should be pursued. That is what I believe in and follow.She is worried that blatant commercialisation by designers these days is making a dent in Indias image overseas. She laments that the finesse with which she did her crafts no longer exists now. Now it has become too commercialised, she gripes, while sipping her soup.Like she zeroed in on Kalamkari, which gave her a chance to express her creativity, one asks. It also created multiple jobs. How many designers have worked on it? We used it for the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. That is when it took off, she says.Sustainability factorThe conversation shifts to how imported fabrics have penetrated across the nation and are threatening to ruin livelihood of artisans. Tamil Nadu is famous for its kanjeeverams which is staple for weavers there. However, there is influx of kanjeeverams from China at one third the price. It has become a huge issue. What is going to happen to weavers of the State?While polishing off Pamelo salad, Madhu feels the solution lies in designers following the path of ethical fashion. Indian fashion designers need to work on this. They should not alter the geographical craft index. There need to be ethics in fashion. There has to be credibility on what we showcase on the ramp. If designers are trying to work with traditional crafts, then economics is a consideration but that doesnt mean that theyforget about backward linkages.She further says that designers need to understand how much damage powerlooms are doing to handlooms. .Everybody is falling in line due to the push given by the powers that be. Our history informs us that crafts have always been protected by rulers. All it needs now is right positioning. The government has to step in to protect our identity, suggests Madhu, a strong proponent of the governments Made In India scheme.In 2018, Madhu forecasts that alternative fabrics, anti-fit silhouettes would be worn by fashionistas. We will have more eco-friendly textiles and practical silhouettes based on comfort. This is where the Ministry has to play a bigger role and I am glad that Smriti Irani is open to new ideas.As far as story of sustainability goes, Madhu is a cut above the rest of her fraternity. And this could be seen from the special award conferred on her by the FICCI.Explaining how she seeks to take the sustainability story forward, Madhu asserts that she is the first designer in the world to come up with bamboo silk ikat. Not even in the North East there is any designer who has converted bamboo, which is found in abundance into textiles. This is my gift to our industry.Sipping fresh orange juice, Madhu opens up about the secret of hard bamboo from which furniture and upholstery is made in the North East.It doesnt require much water. It doesnt take away earths resources. This is textile for the future and is completely organic. One does not require fertilizers for its growth.There need to be ethics in fashion. There has to be credibility on what we showcase on the ramp."
14,Farmers refuse to take out potatoes from cold storage,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-refuse-to-take-out-potatoes-from-cold-storage/article22408266.ece,2018-01-10,The Hindu,"Seikh Mofizul, a potato farmer in Purba Bardhaman district of Bengal, has been spending sleepless nights these days. He had lost about Rs. 2.80 lakhs he had invested in potato farming withthe price of the tuber plummeting owing to overproduction. In 2016-17, 1.15 crore tonnes of potato was produced in the State which was considerably higher than the 90 lakh tonne produced the previous season.I have mortgaged jewellery and some of my lands for growing potato this season and now with the fall in price, I have no way to retrieve the property, Mr. Mofizul told The Hindu. Having lost all hopes of retrieving his investment, he had decided not to take back the 4,500 kg of potato, which he had put in cold storage.Mr. Mofizul was just one among thousands of farmers incurring huge losses owing to the fall in potato prices. From the usual price of Rs. 14 per kg, the farmers were getting just Rs. 1 this year. Apart from Purba and Paschim Bardhaman, potato was cultivated mainly in the districts of Hooghly and Bankura.The potato farmers were unwilling to take out their crop from the cold storage as they did not have the money to pay for the rent. One has to pay about Rs. 80 per sack of potato kept in the cold storage.Accusing the Trinamool Congress for the crisis, the Pradeshik Krishak Sabha, peasant wing of the CPI-M, said it would burn potatoes at Moshagram town on Wednesday."
15,Farmers gain from Israeli agriculture technology,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/farmers-gain-from-israeli-agri-tech/articleshow/62451023.cms,2018-01-11,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: Kalpesh Patel, a farmer in Prantij , earlier made Rs 4 lakh growing cabbage and cauliflower on his 16 bighas of land. Today, from the same produce on the same land, he earns Rs 15 lakh. The secret to his nearly three-fold rise in income is the new Israeli hi-tech protective cultivation and precision farming method.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu will visit Patel and his facility later this week. Patel is not alone. Some 50,000 farmers like him have reaped the benefits of the Centre of Excellence for Protective Cultivation and Precision Farming on Vegetables. The centre at Vadrad village in Sabarkantha district has played a pivotal role in extension of the Indo-Israel Agriculture Plan (IIAP) to 50,000 farmers in the 30 months since it was set up.The Vadrad centre is one of eight in the state, set up in collaboration with Israel. Jitendra Patel, the deputy director for horticulture, who is in charge of the centre, says that the centre is set to demonstrate the technology to farmers and extend it to them, increasing their income.Jitendra Patel said the Vadrad centre raises pest and disease-free saplings at the nominal price of Re 1 per sapling from farmers seeds and hands back saplings to be transplanted in fields. The Vadrad centre has been developed under IIAP at a cost of Rs 11.47 crore. It is focusing on protected cultivation of vegetables.The project has four high-tech temperature and moisture-controlled polyhouses or nurseries, where seedlings are grown for a fortnight under protection till they reach a certain height. Technologies like drip irrigation, protective cultivation of germinated seedlings and a precise mixture of soil and vermicompost are used, which lead to savings on fertilizer costs further on. The seedlings so produced are of high quality and disease-free.Patel said that because of the centre, farmers also get their crop before the trading season begins and consequently, better prices. With the produce arriving a fortnight before others, the farmer earns twice as much as he would in the middle of the season. The quality of vegetables also improves, with the minimal use of chemicals. He added that the fertilizer costs are cut by 70%.Kalpesh Patel, the farmer from Prantij, says, If we choose conventional sowing, there is a fear of damage to the crop. If we sow seed directly in the field, about 25% do not germinate and this is also a direct loss. In the first month, we have to spray insecticide on three or four times, to save seedling from pests and insects. With the seedling developed at the centre, I save on pesticides. During the monsoon, delayed rains can damage growth and hence if I opt for a 30-day seedling, there is no damage even if the rains are delayed.Ahmedabad: In Kadi and Kalol, it is not only the usual tomato, but now also cabbage and cauliflower which is drawing traders from Delhi. Officials of the horticulture department said around 10 traders would would usually go to Kadi or Kalol, are now camping in Prantij, despatching cabbage and cauliflower consignments to Delhi. Officials said about one truckload of cabbage and cauliflower is sent to Delhi every day. Demand for cauliflower is high in north India and traders coming to Kadi and Kalol are also setting up centres in Prantij.Mamroli Grad Turns Farmer, Taps Israeli Ideas For Huge ProfitsAhmedabad: Samir Patel, a B.Sc. in chemistry, has decided to adopt farming as his full-time profession. On a cue from the Centre of Excellence for protected cultivation and precision farming in Vadrad village, he has set up his own nursery. The turnover of his nursery per annum is around Rs 1.5 crore.Patel, a resident of Mamroli, said he was always interested in farming with the latest technology. When I learnt about the centre, I was the first farmer to utilise its services, he said.I still remember that I gave the seeds of bitter gourd (karela) for seeding and, after I received the benefits, I came to the centre and studied the technology in detail, Samir Patel said.He said that he had 25 bighas of land and had taken another 330 bighas in the area on lease. In the year 2014, his profits after deducting the expenses came to around Rs 20 lakh.After adopting Israeli technology, my income had grown and now I make a net profit of around Rs 60 lakh, Samir said.He further said that he was now into farming of potatoes, bitter gourd, tomato, chillis, brocolli, red cabbage and cauliflower, among others. He further said that he had also entered into contract for potato farming with some big multinationals.Regarding the nursery that had been set up on the lines of the Vadrad centre, he said that he had grown seeds at the government centre at Vadrad and had a turnover of Rs 1.5 crore from this nursery alone.Patel further said that his farming had grown so large in scale that now even his wife Daxa had to assist him in taking care of the nursery."

Photo: Hemant Mishra/MintTypically, a new year begins with the resolve to do moremake more money, invest more, save more, give back more, travel more, work out more consistently, spend more time with friends and family, read more, and so it goes.How is it possible to do more of everything? Lets say, for instance, you want to earn more. It may mean taking up more projects, committing more time, which may cut into your leisure. There is also a contradiction between the need to save more and travel more. Its time for some reality checks.We are already almost halfway into January. And if you are on social media or even on WhatsApp, then you must have wished thousands of people a happy new year. But how many of these people did you actually engage with or have a real conversation with? Various studies, over time, have shown that spending too much time on social media platforms can cause anxiety, depression and even lead to suicidal thoughts. Even Facebook, in a recent blog, admitted that social media can cause depression. However, the social networking giant pointed out that the problem affects users who are passively consuming information and are not interacting with others (bit.ly/2moL00H).Likewise for health and fitness. There is a sea of information available out there of things to do for being fitter and healthierfrom new super foods and new diets to new fitness regimes and workouts. Wellness is big business and the Indian wellness industry is growing at a healthy clip of 12% per annum on average to be a Rs1.5 trillion market by financial year 2020, according to a recent report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and consulting firm EY (bit.ly/2kAw63F).In the past year, I have tried to go off sugar, off gluten and off dairy products but with very little success. I am crazy about trying new superfoods and food fads. So oats, nuts, sprouts, millets and sweet potatoes are now a regular part of my diet. However, there is an even longer list which includes cinnamon powder, moringa powder, chia seeds and flax seeds that remain to be introduced. There is also a new handheld Usha blend n mix blender that is yet to be unboxed.And I am not even talking about trying new forms of yoga or Pilates or CrossFit workouts. Or constantly wearing fitness trackers and activity bands, the sales of which have anyways been on the slide. Market leader Fitbit Inc.s shares, at about $6, are worth less than a third of their $20 IPO price in 2015 (bit.ly/2Dk0I4n ). Meanwhile, Jawbone, which made the Up fitness tracker system, also exited the consumer market after burning close to $1 billion of investor money (tcrn.ch/2l1L07I).Its the same when it comes to the way we shop. The advent of fast fashion with brands like Zara, H&M and Forever 21, along with unending sales and convenience of shopping online lends itself well to consumers buying mindlessly. However, the psychological impact of buying discounted garments is that they appear to be less valuable, which then makes it easier for consumers to throw them out. In advanced countries like America where consumers value an abundance of clothing, the trash generated is equivalent to 9% of the total non-recycled waste as consumers throw away about 85% of their clotheseach year totaling 13 million tons of textile (to.pbs.org/2mgyH5F). Given the reports of a spike in sales during the recent festive season or the end of season sales, India seems to be following the US model of consumerism, and the environment hazards of this are well known.However, there seems to be some signs of change. This can be seen in the way we travel. During the past year, experience tourismwalking tours, food trails and star gazing with expertswas one of the fastest growing segments for travel companies like Airbnb Inc. or Thomas Cook-owned Sterling Holidays. This, according to recent presentation by Future Group, is a counter-trend as consumers are now looking for authentic, multi-sensorial experiences following the boredom and superficiality created by a life led looking down into our screens (bit.ly/2CMhnwq).Maybe what the new year warrants is to revisit the way we live in an increasingly connected world and the premium we put on our need for speed. Maybe, instead of doing more this year, we can try to do less, but do it better instead. So, try and buy fewer garments but of better quality. Instead of liking a hundred Facebook posts, pick up the phone and have a one-on-one conversation. Instead of trying multiple new fitness programmes, commit to one and master it.Shop Talk will take a weekly look at consumer trends, behaviour and insights."
17,Blame it on Govt for onion price hike,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/jan/12/blame-it-on-govt-for-onion-price-hike-1751593.html,2018-01-12,The New Indian Express,"By Express News ServiceBHUBANESWAR: Even as the wholesale price of onion in major vegetable mandis of the State remained stable at Rs 3,500 per quintal for over a week, the retail prices stayed firmly above Rs 50 a kg, thanks to inertia of the enforcement agencies of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department.We fail to understand why retailers are selling onion at Rs 50 a kg when they buy it at Rs 35 a kg from the mandi. What is surprising is that the consumers are not protesting when the Government machinery has failed to control the soaring price by cracking down on unscrupulous traders, general secretary of Odisha Byabasai Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said. Since the Government is keeping a tab on the prices of essential commodities on daily basis, it is their look out to ensure that commodities are made available to the consumers at reasonable prices at retails points.The market intelligence wing of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department has the responsibility to impose stock limits on onion and crack down on hoarding. But nothing is happening for obvious reasons, he rued.Ideally, onion should be sold at Rs 40 a kg in the retail market as a margin of Rs 5 per kg is enough for the retailers to make a good profit, said Shakti Shankar Mishra, seceratry of the Aeiginia Potato Merchants Association.The source price of onion, Nasik in Maharashtra being the major supplier of the vegetable, is ruling high due to shortfall in production in Andhra Pradesh and Karanatak, the two other States which also meet Odishas demand. The onion production has fallen short by 8 to 10 per cent due to unseasonal rains in major producing States including Karanataka and Andhra Pradesh. The production of the vegetable this year is about 22 million tonne as against 24 million tonne last year, Panda said adding, the prices will cool down after arrival of the new harvest.While the daily requirement of edible bulb in the State is about 1,500 tonnes, there is a short supply of about 200-300 tonnes. Bhubaneswar, one of the major mandis of the State, is getting a normal supply of about 150 tonne every day, Mishra said."

Well, in that case you may want to head to Park Hyatt for their Goan Food Festival which begins from today. If you are thinking whats so special about this food promotion then think about the blend of Portuguese and Konkani flavours. Chef Tanuja from Park Hyatt, Goa presented an eclectic feast of Goan delights that are available both for lunch and dinner for a price of `1,500+ taxes.The reason why most of the dishes by Tanuja seemed much like the way you prepare at home is that she learned the recipes from her mother. Thats how Goan Dal Fry prepared with coconut, red lentils, onions, curry leaves and mustard seeds which tasted really well with steamed rice and succulent pieces of Mutton Vindaloo cooked in a red tangy curry.The Chicken Cafreal won our hearts with its green marination of coriander and mint cooked with other spices. The condiments had seeped into the chicken pieces making them succulent-juicy. We recommend Caldo Verde: the potato soup with baby spinach in which the addition of green olives is very Portuguese.

Those who braved the early morning chill to head to the Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday, part from of course retail merchants, came away with bagas of vegetables, most of them for a scarcely believable Rs 10 per kg and below.With truckloads of vegetables flooding the market, the cost of vegetables has crashed. Chandran , president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association said brinjal, beans, cabbage, ladies finger (okra), broad beans and tomato sold for less than Rs 10 per kilogram.The arrival of trucks with these vegetables has increased by 25% from the average 100 to 125 vehicles. So, this has reflected in a significant drop , he said.While one kilogram of onion cost anything between Rs 30/kg and Rs 40/kg, potato and yam sold for Rs 15/kg to Rs 20/kg and Rs 20/kg to Rs 25/kg.The wholesale market received 450 trucks of vegetables and about 50 vehicles more to meet the demand for Pongal from different parts of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka The situation in the retail markets, however, was different, with residents in many areas saying prices were much higher.Responding to this, Chandran said retail traders would factor in a minimum a profit margin of Rs 10 for every kilogram of vegetables to meet the expenses incurred in transporting the goods to respective places."

Picture by Manob ChowdharyRanchi: The extreme weather has claimed its first casualty: the potato.Farmers on the fringes of the state capital say low temperatures have ruined more than half of their crops and a supply crisis was imminent in city markets, which by default will jack up prices of the otherwise humble vegetable.Deepak Mahto, an elderly farmer from Boreya, said they often brought stocks from Bengal and Uttar Pradesh to bridge the demand-supply gap and ensure price stability, but the yield in the neighbouring states had suffered as much as in Jharkhand.Kishwar Sahu, who owns a few fertile decimals of land in Chandaghasi, near Birsa Munda Airport, said the plummeting Celsius had reduced his potato production to one-eighth of last year's crop.""Every year, I sow potato in four decimal land and the yield is at least 400kg. This time, I am not expecting more than 50kg. The numbing cold at harvest time is pure bad news. We also have smaller sized potatoes this year,"" he said.Arun Sahu, a resident of Argora, echoed him. ""I do not depend on farming for a living, but I do sow potato in a small plot on my premises. The cold has taken a heavy toll on the crop this time.""Director of research D.N. Singh at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) in Kanke, where the Celsius notched the freezing point for two consecutive days last week, said the potato needed moderate temperature (10-25 degree Celsius) for proper growth. ""But, the past fortnight has been unnaturally cold even by Ranchi's standard. No wonder the crop yield has suffered,"" Singh said.Director of horticulture Rajiw Kumar, however, said it was too early to anticipate a hike in potato prices owing to low production.""Around 7 lakh metric tonnes of potato is produced in Jharkhand against the average annual requirement of 16 lakh metric tonnes. We depend on supply from Bengal and Uttar Pradesh too. Let me study district-wise yield reports and access production data from neighbouring states before I can comment on prices,"" he said, but conceded that extreme cold had a negative impact on potato production, especially in the absence of proper irrigation.A potato vendor in the city, Bablu Kumar, said currently, the price of a kilo ranged between Rs 8 and Rs 14. ""Now, that is because old stocks are still available. Once that is exhausted, the price will rise because as far as I know crops in Bengal and UP have suffered too,"" he summed it up."
21,Problem of plenty,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/problem-of-plenty/article22445779.ece,2018-01-16,The Hindu,"There appears to be no end in sight to the cycle of boom and bust in the prices of agricultural goods. Over the last few weeks, across India the price of potatoes has fallen sharply after a year of bumper production. With the price of a kilogram of potato dropping as low as under a rupee in certain wholesale markets, many distressed farmers have left their produce to rot on the roads, and in cold storage facilities. Curiously, potato prices were many times higher just months ago amid scarce supply. Last year, the price of other produce like red chilli, tur dal and tomato witnessed a similar trend of steep falls compared to the previous season. The sharp swing in prices has been explained by the Cobweb phenomenon. Farmers tend to increase the production of certain crops in response to their high prices during the previous season, which in turn leads to a supply glut that causes prices to crash. The cycle repeats each passing year, with the lag between price and production causing a huge mismatch between supply and demand. The present fall in potato prices comes against the backdrop of a slowdown in the rural economy. According to advance GDP estimates released by the government last week, farm growth is expected to drop from 4.9% in 2016-17 to 2.1% in 2017-18.Given the humanitarian and political costs of agricultural distress, particularly in a year when many big States go to the polls, local governments could turn towards populism to satisfy their rural voter base. This could come in the form of fiscal measures such as farm loan waivers, a higher minimum support price for farm produce, or some combination of the two. The next Union budget may well be focussed on the rural economy through fiscal measures. Such relief measures that temporarily ease the pain on farmers, however, will fail to make a significant difference to their lives in the long run. Any permanent solution to the problem of agricultural distress will have to deal with the challenge of price fluctuations. The boom-and-bust cycle is the result of a broken supply chain that is over-regulated. In the absence of a robust market for buying and selling forward-looking contracts, farmers are left to fend for themselves against severe fluctuations. In addition, the domination of the wholesale market by cartels prevents farmers from receiving a fair price even when their produce is sold at much higher rates to consumers. The government must resolve to address these structural issues, and not limit itself to ad hoc policy measures in firefighting mode. There is a need to give farmers not just a better, but also more stable, return on their crops."

Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads..., Gandhi said at a public meeting in Salon.He was referring to Modis poll promise to deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen by cracking down on black money, if voted to power.He alleged that a step-motherly treatment was being meted out to Rae Bareli, his mother, Sonia Gandhis parliamentary constituency, and Amethi. He promised to restore the mega food park in Rae Bareli and other development projects once Congress was voted back to power.Farmers are not getting remunerative price for their produce. They grow potato and mint but had been denied remunerative price. Farmers were committing suicide and throwing away their potato, he said.Rahul Gandhi went to Hanuman temple situated on the borders of Rae Bareli with Lucknow. Rahul also donated khichri on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. He also stopped for a cup of tea at Nigoha near Rae Bareli.Modi and Yogi for giving long speeches - Both of them believed in putting people against each other. They can not claim of launching a scheme that may have benefited the people.Had the food park -- scrapped by the Modi government -- been set up in Amethi, farmers in Rae Bareli, Amethi and other districts would have been benefitted, he told a gathering in nearby Pratapgarh.They are meting out a step-motherly treatment to you. They snatch away whatever development plan comes here and hurt you, said Gandhi.The 47-year-old called upon people to gear up for Uttar Pradesh polls and the Lok Sabha election due in 2019.The Congress had tied up with the Samajwadi Party for the 2017 UP election but was wiped out, with the BJP storming to power with a brute majority.Gujarat, where his party put up an impressive show but couldnt dislodge the ruling BJP, also found a mention in Gandhis address.Illustrating the alleged failure of the Modi model of development, he said. Ninety per cent universities in Gujarat are in private hands. A youth told me that students need to pay Rs 15 lakh to get admission there. he said.POSTER WARA poster war seems to have erupted ahead of Congress chief visit. While some posters depicted Rahul as Lord Krishna, others questioned his work as MP. The posters that were critical of the Congress chief, however, disappeared soon.A group of youth, holding placards questioning Gandhi and reminding him of his promise to connect Salon with rail, was chased away by Congress leaders before the arrival of party chief, sources said."

24,Bengaluru: Veggies get pocket-friendly,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/19/bengaluru-veggies-get-pocket-friendly-1758226.html,2018-01-19,The New Indian Express,"Ashwini M Sripad ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: With the supply of vegetables crossing three times the demand, vegetable prices have drastically dropped. Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

Minister on Friday claimed that the father-son only paid lip service to farmers during their rule but were now trying to malign the Yogi Adityanath government by dumping potatoes.He added that a panel formed by the government on the problems being faced by the States potato farmers will submit its report on January 22.The father-son duo, claiming to be Dharti Putra (son of the soil) and messiah of farmers, is forgetting that they were in power for 15 long years in the State and paid lip service to farmers, U.P. Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi said.He alleged that the SP leaders were now working against the Adityanath government.Farmers dont come in the dark to throw potatoes in front of the CMs residence. They will protest in broad daylight as they are not thieves who come out at night, he said.Taking a jibe at the SP over the potato-throwing incident in Lucknow, he said, Keeping in view the problems of potato farmers, the Chief Minister has constituted a committee under his Deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya and Forest Minister Dara Singh Chauhan. I am also a member of the committee.The report of this committee will be submitted on January 22 to the Chief Minister, he said.Potato farmers faced problems during the terms of earlier governments too and now the purchase rate of potato is fixed, he said, adding, When the rate of potato was Rs. 250-300 per quintal, we fixed it at Rs. 467 per quintal.Two people, including a Samajwadi Party worker, were arrested last Saturday for allegedly hurling potatoes near the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly.On tweets of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav slamming the BJP government on the farmers issue, Mr. Shahi said, Akhilesh is a victim of unemployment these days and he can only tweet, but his tweets have no facts. Samajwadi Party didnt work for farmers, but the BJP is doing the job.The PM is working hard to double the income of the farmers by 2022 and the farmers loans were waived and under various projects crores of rupees are being made available for seed and agriculture machine purchase, Mr. Shahi said.Because of the hard work done by the BJP, other parties are getting depressed, he said."
26,From Dalit activist to Gujarat MLA: Tracking Jignesh Mevani's journey,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-depth-jignesh-mevani-s-journey-from-a-dalit-activist-to-vadgam-mla/story-T9N0QvSF6jVaah8tjKPlQI.html,2018-01-20,Hindustan Times,"Jignesh Mevani, underdressed for the chilly morning at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus, walks tiredly into a dhaba. Hands in pockets, he squints at the freshly prepared potato curry, looks away, and stares through a cloud of misty breath. My body is going to give up, he says.Mevani is exhausted. Eighteen days after winning the assembly election from north Gujarats Vadgam constituency, the 36-year-old is in Delhi for a short visit  he is giving interviews, participating in television news shows and posing for pictures. He is upset about not being able to return the dozens of phone calls hes been getting. He is worried about his meetings in Ahmedabad where he was supposed to be.But his eyes brighten when a student, who takes some time to register that it is indeed Mevani sitting next to him, asks him about his plans for Vadgam. Wolfing down his food, Mevani says, You come to Vadgam after one year and see for yourself. We are going to transform the constituency. I will invite experts from various fields including RTI, health, education, social justice, research, to contribute in making Vadgam a model constituency. He means what hes just said. For Jignesh Mevani now belongs to the people. He appears for the momentto be symbolic of the disenchantment brewing in Gujarati society. He is the rare Dalit leader who has developed a massive following within his own community and outside. At a time when dissent is difficult, Mevani does not miss an opportunity to criticise the government. He won an election in his maiden attempt, without joining any political party. Now he will have to work within the official framework of governance, make the bureaucrats see his vision, continue from where his predecessor left off, and still make sure that he doesnt let his people down.But in the JNU campus, despite talking enthusiastically to the student about his plans for Vadgam, he seems tired, as if he doesnt really want the students to recognise him, as if all he wants is a few quiet moments of anonymity.JIGNESH AND VAN GOGHMevani wouldnt mind the title Vincent Van Gogh 2.0 for himself. He left a stunning impact on my soul, says Mevani of the late Dutch painter, considered one of the greatest artists of all time. His passion was mind boggling. I derive my zeal from him.He first read about the artist while doing a Bachelors in English Literature at HK Arts College, Ahmedabad, an institution that shaped his worldview to a large extent. That was where he met two people who would influence his thoughts and actions in ways he could not imagine. Saumya Joshi, then associate professor, English, was a dramatist. I was impressed as hell to see how Saumyas plays depicted the concerns of the marginalised, says Mevani. He exposed me to the arts, literature and theatre.Sanjay Bhave, also a faculty member in the English department, introduced him to the stalwarts of social activism in Gujarat. Bhave saheb glamourised them. I used to think, life toh aisa hona chahiye, where you can look beyond just a salary. Pagaar toh mil hi jaayegi. (Everyone works for a salary. The actual aim should be changing peoples lives).During his college years, Mevani was never seen as Jignesh, that Dalit lad.It was an extension of how he was raised in a middle-class joint family in Ahmedabads Medhaninagar area. While he was aware of his identity, it was not a topic of discussion at the dining table in the Mevani household. His mother retired from the BSNL as a clerk and his father was with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Over the newspaper, Papa and I used to discuss general issues. Our debates were not about the problems of our community, he says.Mevani got a PG Diploma in Journalism from Ahmedabads Bhavans College and shifted to Mumbai where he worked for a news magazine Abhiyaan for three years.With his fans at the JNU campus, New Delhi in the first week of January. The youth, specially students, are impressed by his aggression and oratory. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)He returned in 2008 and began working with the civil rights organisation Jan Sangharsh Manch (JSM) run by the activist-lawyer Mukul Sinha, one of the people he had idolised during college. Jignesh used to call him kaka (uncle), recalls Mukul Sinhas wife, Nirjari Sinha. (Mukul Sinha died in 2014). He worked with us on the rights of sanitation workers and security guards. He was unsure about his career. Mukul asked him to pursue law, she recounts. So Mevani went on to do an LLB from Gujarat University.In the years to come, Mukul Sinha would become one of the three kakas who Mevani would revere and through whose work he would come face to face with the ground reality of Gujarat. The other two were activist-lawyer Girish Patel and the Gandhian activist, the late Chunni Bhai Vaidya, who worked for land reforms and the creation of sustainable rural economies. It was at Mukul kakas office where, for the first time, I understood atrocity in the real sense of the term. When I heard stories of undertrials in POTA, I was not able to sleep for many nights, he says.Mevani remained true to the spirit of Van Gogh in his passion for whatever he had set his mind on, a passion that could border on obsession. He submerged himself in the cases he fought, the academic exercises he undertook, and the causes he felt for. While analysing the works of Gujarati poet Mareez, also known as the Ghalib of Gujarat, he went to the extent of tracing people for whom Mareez used to ghost-write. To understand the life of freedom fighters, he travelled to Rajguru Nagar in Pune, the birthplace of Shivaram Rajguru, Sanjay Bhave remembers Mevanis obsessive streak.After studying the history of the Dalit community, Mevani concluded that their poor socio-economic condition was partly because a majority of them they did not own land.On July 11, 2016, Mevani was a member of the AAP and working as a lawyer with the JSM when cow vigilantes thrashed four Dalit men on the allegation of skinning a dead cow in Una, a city in Gujarats Gir Somnath district, 350 km from Ahmedabad.The Una case, which became symbolic of Dalit atrocities throughout the country, was the turning point that Mevani had unknowingly been prepping for. He went full throttle. Along with his friends, Mevani formed the Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDAM) which conducted a Dalit mahasabha in Ahmedabad on July 31.Jignesh Mevani with Balasaheb Ambedkar, Prashant Dhotha, Radhika Vemula and Umar Khalid at the 'Elgar Parishad' to commemorate 200th anniversary of Koregaon-Bhima battle at Shaniwarwada, Pune. (Rahul Raut/HT PHOTO)It was followed by a 10-day march on foot from Ahmedabad to Una which culminated on Independence Day. Gaaye nu puchhdu taame rakho, aamne amaari jameen aapo (You keep the cows tail, give us our land), Mevani hopped from village to village, repeating the slogan in every public meeting where Dalits took a vow that they would not henceforth lift the carcasses of dead cows.During lunch breaks, the RDAM members would review Mevanis speeches  was the audience relating to him or not; why was the crowd in a particular gathering smaller than expected; should he modify the content to suit local sensibilities; what was the extent of media coverage of the rallies.In hindsight, Mevani says, the Una incident catapulting him to the national stage was a lot about timing. Dalits have faced far worse brutalities than what we saw in Una. But the outcry in the Una case was unmatched. Certain things resonate at certain points. This was one of them, he says.THE MANDATEThe Vadgam election had dimensions of a David vs Goliath contest.On November 27, seventeen days before polling in Vadgam, Mevani announced, through a Facebook post, that he would be in the fray. Far from being wise, the last-moment decision verged on the insane. I was confused, he explains. We had no money or concrete organisation. At the same time I realised that I was at my best as an activist. I had caught the peoples imagination. My campaign would get massive media coverage due to which my opponent would appear diminished. So I jumped into it.On the one hand, there was the formidable electoral machinery of the BJP, oiled by the party president Amit Shah at the helm. The party had ruled Gujarat for 22 years and was looking to win at least 150 out of 182 assembly seats. On the other side was Mevani, a novice, self-proclaimed agitator, who was out to expose the socio-economic conditions of farmers, Scheduled Castes and minorities.Ironically, Mevanis image became his biggest stumbling block in the election. Dalits, comprising 16% of Vadgam population, could relate to his agenda. But the predominant Chaudhary community was not comfortable with his approach. They presumed that with Jignesh as an MLA, they would be routinely booked under the Atrocities Act because Dalits worked in their farms and factories, says Sagar Rabari, 50, a social activist and general secretary of Gujarat Khedut Samaj, who helped Mevani devise his election strategy. I had to act as Jigneshs guarantor, says Rabari.Supporters at a public meeting during Jignesh Mevanis election campaign in Vadgam, Gujarat, on December 10, 2017. This was Mevanis first election. (Kunal Patil/HT PHOTO)A lot, however, was going in Mevanis favour. The AAP and the Congress withdrew their candidates so that voters had a choice between Mevani and the BJP. Crowdfunding platform crowdnewsing.com raised Rs 20.5 lakh for his campaign. By the time of the election, Mevani had polished his oratory skills, having spoken at multiple forums in the one year period since the Una incident. Four teams were canvassing for himhis aides from Ahmedabad, activists and volunteers from Delhi, the local communities in Vadgam, and the Congress cadre.In retrospect, Mevani admits that he spent more time convincing people why they should vote the BJP out than talking about the change he intended to bring. We didnt elaborate on what we would do. My positive campaign was inbuilt in my image. I believe that I got 4,000 votes only on my credibility, he says.The BJP claimed that Mevani was an outsider; that he had accepted funding from the Social Democratic Party of India, a political wing of Popular Front of India (PFI), which has been accused of terror links (Mevani denied the charges); and that he was using Muslims for votes. The last charge stemmed from Mevanis interview published in the Forward Press, which quoted him saying that his first girlfriend was a Muslim.Mevanis victory was a vindication for his supporters not just in Gujarat but across the nation. At the all-India level, the anti-right forces are in search of some spark. They have found that in Jignesh. His position in Gujarat is reinforced with his national position, says Ahmedabad-based sociologist Ghanshyam Shah. If Muslims wanted someone whose hand they could hold, they have found that person.VADGAM IN WAITINGThe people who have been part of his journey so far or who have monitored his trajectory seem to know where he is faltering and the pitfalls that lie in his way forward as an MLA.He should watch his words. The radicalism he shows at times makes him vulnerable. Else the government will file cases against him and he will find himself entangled in legal battles, Sanjay Bhave echoes a concern shared by almost all of Mevanis well-wishers. Now he should rise above Modi-bashing and talk about concrete issues, he adds.He will have to cut down on travel and concentrate on his constituency. Now people have expectations from Jignesh Mevani, the MLA. He has to deliver. He cant continue to only be an orator, says Nirjari Sinha.Ghanshyam Shah suggests that Mevani should have a panoramic view of society and politics and move ahead accordingly. Currently, all the information he is getting is from the media. For long-term politics, he should have a group or a think tank which dispassionately reflects on the ground situation.Mevani says that the one criticism he has got the mostthat he should be less aggressive  is not unwarranted. I agree with this, he says. But the problem is that I wont remain who I am if I start working on this. This is who I am.About the charge that he over-travels, he says, Me going to various states energises the youth and Dalit groups. I should keep doing that but not at the cost of Vadgam.THE JUBILATIONIt will be some weeks before Mevani overcomes the euphoria of the resounding win that caught his aides and the country by surprise.Mevani is still getting used to being addressed as MLA saheb. I bought 10 new kurtas, all of different colours. I like wearing them with folded sleeves, with a wrist watch on my left hand. I flash the victory sign like a neta (politician) does. I am quite enjoying this. His eyes sparkle. But the feeling has not sunk in as yet.Mevani underplays the congratulatory phone calls and the meeting with the Congress party president Rahul Gandhi before the election. He describes it as a Hi, hello meeting. He is still getting accustomed to his new role  learning how to greet people, how to listen to them, how to become a leader his followers can admire and look up to.Like the bunch of students who surround him at the dhaba in JNU, vying for selfies with him, cautioning him, in awe of him, and waiting for him to prove them right. Responding to each one of them, Mevani seems like a leader at the start of an eventful and uncertain voyage. I am also a brand now, a force to reckon with, he says in a matter-of-fact tone."
27,UP: Potato subsidy policy to be tweaked for farmers' benefit,http://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-potato-subsidy-policy-to-be-tweaked-for-farmers-benefit/story-r0rOJGMApRjH41IHiqFMYJ.html,2018-01-20,Hindustan Times,"The Mandi Parishad will modify its policy on potato transportation subsidy to the extent that it benefits farmers more and not traders.The Mandi Parishad board has also cleared a proposal for giving subsidy on export of potato and mango of all varieties. Till now, the subsidy was available to only select varieties like Taj brand of potato and Nawab brand of mango, said an official.The move comes in the backdrop of the opposition raising the problems of potato growers and alleging they were not getting a fair price for their produce even though the fresh crop too has arrived.The mandi board of directors meeting was presided over by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday.At the meeting, it was pointed out that transport subsidy introduced by the government last year ended up benefiting traders instead of farmers.The subsidy was introduced to help farmers lift potato from cold storages and sell the same in other cities and states to get a better price.An official said, 99% of the benefit of the transport subsidy went to traders and transporters and only 1% to farmers. It was, therefore, decided at the meeting to launch the scheme this year in a new form so that the subsidy amount went to farmers more.Under the scheme launched last year, the government provided transportation subsidy at Rs 50 per quintal on the potato to be transported to a distance of over 250 km.Although last years actual bills are yet to be submitted for clearance, the Mandi Parishad may have to bear an expenditure of around Rs 60 crore as transport subsidy, said the official."
28,Ritual comes in plastic,https://www.telegraphindia.com/calcutta/ritual-comes-in-plastic-202490?ref=calcutta-new-stry,2018-01-20,Telegraph,"Debraj MitraThe customised basket that's on offer at Spencer's outlets across the city. Picture by Bishwarup DuttaCalcutta: A centuries-old Bengali tradition associated with the goddess of wisdom has come wrapped in plastic, customised for small families, in the run-up to this year's Saraswati Puja.On the day after Panchami, a large section of Bengali kitchens - mostly Ghotis - make a steamed dish of uncut mixed vegetables and lentil, popularly known as Gota Seddho (uncut and boiled).The vegetables used include baby potatoes, brinjals, green peas, spinach with buds and flower, sweet potatoes and flat beans among others.Customised baskets with all these items are available at Spencer's stores across the city from Friday. Each basket costs Rs 120 and should serve four to five people, Kaushik Ganguly, head of operations (east), Spencer's Retail, said.""Saraswati Puja dates back to thousands of years, like the Bengali race. She first appears in the Rig Veda. But there is no mention of the steamed vegetable dish in any scripture. Like many other rituals, it probably made its way into the tradition because of evolving local culture,"" author Mani Shankar Mukherjee, better known as Shankar, said.Similarly, for people with roots in Bangladesh, there is a ritual of cooking two hilsas on Saraswati Puja.""Bengalis are famous for neatly peeling and chopping vegetables. But in doing so, the nutritional value of the vegetables gets diminished. Whole vegetables discount that possibility,"" Mukherjee, associated with the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group that owns Spencer's, said.The steamed dish made from fresh vegetables was prescribed to counter pox, he said. In the absence of vaccines, pox was one of the deadliest diseases and killed thousands.Durga and Kali pujas are synonymous with Calcutta. But the number of Saraswati Puja is far more.The 25 Spencer's outlets have a footfall of close to 2 million a month, Ganguly said. The ""Saraswati Ayojan"" is an attempt to weave local traditions into the retail chain's bouquet, he said."

I bought 10 new kurtas, all of different colours. I like wearing them with folded sleeves, with a wrist watch on my left hand. I flash the victory sign like a neta (politician) does. I am quite enjoying this. His eyes sparkle. But the feeling has not sunk in as yet.Mevani underplays the congratulatory phone calls and the meeting with the Congress party president Rahul Gandhi before the election. He describes it as a Hi, hello meeting. He is still getting accustomed to his new role  learning how to greet people, how to listen to them, how to become a leader his followers can admire and look up to.Like the bunch of students who surround him at the dhaba in JNU, vying for selfies with him, cautioning him, in awe of him, and waiting for him to prove them right. Responding to each one of them, Mevani seems like a leader at the start of an eventful and uncertain voyage. I am also a brand now, a force to reckon with, he says in a matter-of-fact tone."

Till now, the subsidy was available to only select varieties like Taj brand of potato and Nawab brand of mango, said an official.The move comes in the backdrop of the opposition raising the problems of potato growers and alleging they were not getting a fair price for their produce even though the fresh crop too has arrived.The mandi board of directors meeting was presided over by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday.At the meeting, it was pointed out that transport subsidy introduced by the government last year ended up benefiting traders instead of farmers.The subsidy was introduced to help farmers lift potato from cold storages and sell the same in other cities and states to get a better price.An official said, 99% of the benefit of the transport subsidy went to traders and transporters and only 1% to farmers. It was, therefore, decided at the meeting to launch the scheme this year in a new form so that the subsidy amount went to farmers more.Under the scheme launched last year, the government provided transportation subsidy at Rs 50 per quintal on the potato to be transported to a distance of over 250 km.Although last years actual bills are yet to be submitted for clearance, the Mandi Parishad may have to bear an expenditure of around Rs 60 crore as transport subsidy, said the official."

TGIFridays has recently launched their hangover brunch every weekend, which has all the right appetisers, entrees and desserts to satisfy your hungover heart, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks to either refresh you, or keep the buzz going.We started the meal with some mocktails  the Basil Peach Cooler and the Gold Mango Margarita, both of which were a tad bit too strong for our tastes, but were also high on flavour and taste. We tried the Chocolate Milkshake next, which was rich, thick and decadent  just how a good milkshake should be.If you are looking to keep their spirits high by taking care of your hangover with another drink, try Hangover Bloody Mary. This drink, is a meal in itself. The tall glass, the classic tomato juice-based cocktail is served in, is decorated with a lamb slider, chicken wings, fries and celery sticks - an ideal meal for one. The red wine sangria is also a good option  sweeter and full of fruit than sangrias served in most other places.TGIF has a number of options in appetisers. From egg-heavy dishes such as Breakfast Tacos and Breakfast Potato Skins, to fried food for the hungover soul. We tried the Calamari Frites, and though hesitant to try shellfish in places not directly on the coast, we found this dish to be fresh, crispy and delicious, complemented perfectly with marinara sauce. We also tried the Friday Mushrooms - crispy batter fried mushrooms served with a sauce.For mains, we first tried the Classic American Veg Pizza, and though not up to par with the some of the great pizza Bengaluru has been serving up of late, it does have a very homemade feel to it. The Pasta Alfredo is not for the faint hearted or the almost-full, as it is very creamy and rich, just the way an Alfredo ought to be. The winner among the mains for us was the Hangover Burger, again, meant for someone with a hearty appetite. This delicious monster has a juicy lamb patty paired with bacon, caramelized onions and all your other burger fixings, and is topped off with a fried egg. Some of the other good options among the mains are the Steak and Eggs and the Crispy Chicken Sliders.For dessert, we thought wed keep it simple, and the brunch menu has also stuck to the same theme by only listing two dishes. We tried the Sizzling Brownie, and it was one of the best weve had in recent times, and also much bigger than most. Served with large scoop of vanilla ice cream and generous amounts of chocolate sauce, it was the perfect end to this gastronomic meal.The Hangover brunch is on every Saturday and Sunday, 12 noon to 3 pm. Prices start at ` 1,695."

Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi has said.His remarks came a few days after quintals of potatoes were thrown by farmers in front of the Vidhan Sabha building here. The farmers were enraged at receiving lower prices for their produce.Mr. Shahi had attacked the Samajwadi Party for the January 6 incident, saying it was trying to malign the image of the Yogi Adityanath government.The government is serious about resolving the problems of potato farmers. A sub-committee has been formed and it has already met twice. We are considering a number of steps in the interest of potato growers, he said.The panel will submit its report by January 22, he added.Also, the Yogi Adityanath government will felicitate 11 progressive farmers on U.P. Diwas on January 24, he said. These farmers have done something exemplary in the field of agriculture, sugarcane cultivation, fisheries, horticulture and others, Mr. Shahi said.He said the government had received complaints regarding wholesalers and retailers forcing farmers to buy zinc powder with fertilizers. We have got complaints from Agra and Aligarh divisions. Instructions have been issued to conduct raids and take stern action against such dealers, Mr. Shahi said."
35,Potato portents,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/crop-prices-modi-government-indian-farmers-potato-rates-5035179/,2018-01-23,Indian Express,"The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)Farmers are habitually great raconteurs. My grandfather would often narrate an episode, when he encountered a farmer sitting by a heap of potatoes in the middle of the night. On investigating what compelled the farmer to guard potatoes when there were no buyers, he was astonished to learn that the farmer was, in fact, keeping a watch to deter anyone from dumping their unsold spuds in his field. This 40-year-old episode got a rerun recently when farmers dumped their unsold produce in front of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home and office in Lucknow.The genesis of the potato crises in Lucknow, however, is more recent. In June 2014, soon after the BJP won a stunning mandate in the general elections, one of the first acts of the Union government was to rein in the price of potatoes (refer to my article, Making a hash of it, IE, July 5, 2014) by imposing a minimum export price (MEP), which was followed by bringing potatoes under the essential commodities Act (ECA) and permitting duty-free imports even though imports carried the risk of new diseases. Farmers were harassed and cold stores raided. The euphoria of the electoral victory celebrations drowned out the farmers sorrow. Farmers took home meagre profits, substantially less than they could have easily made. The presumptive loss to 50 lakh potato farmers on a very conservative basis was Rs 30,000 crore (total production 42 million tonnes X R.7/kg, the subdued price) amounting to Rs 60,000 per potato farmer.Profits from the previous harvest usually determine the acreage under sowing for the next season. Consequently, in the following year, India had a bumper crop of 48 million tonnes of potato in 2015 and prices crashed to Rs 2.75/kg. The government ignored the plight of farmers who subsequently failed to even recover the cost of sowing.2016 was a normal crop year in India, with 44 million tonnes of potato production. Without credible data, fearing inflation, the government overreacted and again imposed MEP. Without access to international markets, the prices faltered. Unfortunately, demonetisation in November that year made matters worse. The presumptive loss of Rs 22,000 crore (Rs 5/kg) was incurred by farmers, amounting to an average loss of Rs 44,000 per potato farmer for 2016 year alone. Our export restrictions were a bonanza for farmers in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Importers seek reliable business partners and India has become an unreliable supplier due to arbitrary policy decisions. Our produce now sells at a substantial discount compared to our neighbours.In 2017, due to the relatively firmer prices of 2016 and boosted by good weather, farmers produced 48 million tonnes of potato and prices literally crashed through the basement. When, even after 10 months of storage, prices were hovering between 50 paisa to Rs 2/kg, farmers completely lost hope. The cost of growing potatoes being Rs 6.50/kg and the additional cost of storage is Rs 2.50/kg, it became infeasible to even reclaim stocks from cold storages and potatoes were strewn in Lucknow and elsewhere.Do the farmers math: In two of the four years of the Modi government, when an opportunity arose to double farm incomes, the governments inflation targeting strategy kicked in and each potato farmer lost approximately Rs 1,04,000. The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. There is no denying that controlling food inflation has to be a priority. I confess, as a potato farmer, I have a vested interest in the issue but it is this experience that gives me insight. Our demand is fair and simple: Should the government intervene to subdue potato prices in a bad crop year, it is morally bound to give a minimum support price of Rs 9/kg in excess production year. Logically, a farmer allowed to make money in one year, would be better prepared to bear the losses on the farm in the next. If not, the farmer gets into a perpetual debt cycle and is compelled to seek financial sops. Consequently, most farmer organisations are content to limiting themselves to what the farmer understands  farm loan waiver and venture no further into the policymaking quagmire.In 2018, the planting is lower by a mere five per cent, and potato prices are expected to be remunerative. But historical data indicates that a short-sighted government may respond by imposing MEP/ECA. The solutions to the farm crises arent limited to budget allocations but rooted in a system where interventions to control food inflation are not harmonised with crop-price compensation. As far as the farmer livelihoods are concerned, state governments and the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer Welfare are becoming less relevant, as decisions of the Ministry of Food, Public Distribution & Consumer Affairs are demolishing the prime ministers grand plan for doubling farmer incomes.Farmers are demoralised. The promised sab ka saath sab ka vikas rings hollow, because its starkly evident that the government has decided to focus on the urban vote bank as a part of the strategy to win the parliamentary elections in 2019. About 50 per cent of the population is financially dependent directly on agriculture, but religious, caste and ever-changing narratives divide farmers across villages to the extent that farmers arent considered a political force to be reckoned with any more. The Opposition is in an equally sad state, without a farmer face to galvanise the community. Nevertheless, farmers could change fortunes in the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, allowing the Opposition to bask in the farmers misery.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Civil works to club the 500 shops on the ground floor into 250 shops are under way. Earlier, the traders were hesitant to move to the new facility citing inadequate space. Authorities said that they were expecting at least 100-150 traders initially to occupy the integrated market.The over century -old Gandhi Market, which is a commercial hub of at least 10 districts in the central zone, was expanded last during the pre-Independence era. Situated in the heart of the city, the market also happens to the epicentre of frequent traffic congestion. Earlier, to decongest the market, Trichy district administration, at an estimated cost of Rs65 crore, took up the construction of an integrated vegetable and fruit market on 9.7 acres on the city outskirts at Kallikudi in 2014. The works were apparently completed in mid-2017. Even though the facility was formally inaugurated last year, it was lying unoccupied owing to the resistance from traders in the existing market to shift their business. Authorities said that the agriculture marketing department recently obtained the administrative sanction form agriculture department to make the required structural modification in Kallikudi integrated vegetable market to address the demand of the traders for more space.""After completing the ongoing works, we would invite traders to occupy the facility. We expect 100-150 traders who are operating on rental space, will make use of the modified facility,"" an official source with agriculture marketing department said. Sources added that the structural modification works are expected to conclude in a month.Traders alleged that they were not consulted during the construction works of the integrated vegetable market complex. Stating that the whole episode, including expenditure incurred to modify the facility would have been avoided, if they were assured of adequate space in the new facility. ""We do not have any issues in moving to the new market. Our concern is that we need adequate facilities for shifting our base. Traders who are operating from rental shops in Gandhi Market may shift to the new place. It has also got practical difficulty, our sales and profit would remain intact only if all of us stay nearby,"" N Saravanan , secretary of Onion and Potato wholesale dealers association in Gandhi Market told TOI.It seems that even the traders do not have many options as the efforts made by the traders to construct their own market went in vain owing to the high cost of land in city. Authorities claimed that making a few wholesale traders to occupy the refurbished integrated vegetable market post completion of the works would invite other traders in Gandhi Market to shift to the new facility."

Yet, prices crashed, 8,007 farmers committed suicide in 2015, unpaid agricultural loans rose 20 per cent between 2016 and 2017, and 600 million Indians who depend on agriculture are struggling to get by.This is the situation that faces the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as it heads into its last full budget before general elections in 2019, at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised doubling of farm incomes by 2022.The agriculture sector will not just watch how much money is set aside in the 2018-19 budget but also how it is used, as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) also tries to woo disaffected farmers before upcoming Assembly elections in eight states  Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and the northeastern states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura.Agriculture is the governments top priority, finance minister Arun Jaitley said on January 15, 2018, admitting that farmers were not getting the right price for their produce. That is an acknowledgement that record harvests and government spending are not significantly improving Indias agricultural crisis.Record harvest, falling incomeIndia has seen a decline in the proportion of cultivators  as the census calls farmers who own or rent land  from 50 per cent in 1951 to 24 per cent in 2011, as IndiaSpend reported on August 8, 2014. Yet, nearly half of Indias population, or about 600 million people, still depend on agriculture.India harvested a record 276 million tonnes  all-time highs were reported for rice, wheat, pulses, tur (pigeon pea), urad (black gram) and coarse cereals  4.01 per cent higher than the previous record in 2013-14, according to the fourth advance estimates for the rabi (winter) and kharif (monsoon) crops for 2016-17.Similarly, horticulture output was a record, nearly 300 million tonnes, or 4.8 per cent more than 2015-16, with potatoes  now experiencing a glut, leading to unrest among potato farmers in Uttar Pradesh  recording an 11 per cent rise over the previous year.Over a decade ending 2014-15, Indias agriculture sector grew at 4 per annum compared to 2.6 per annum the previous decade, according to the 2017 Dalwai Committee report that explored how farm incomes could be doubled, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised in 2016and IndiaSpend reported on March 30, 2016, as being unlikely.An indicator of growing problems in Indias agricultural economy is a drop in the growth of gross value added (GVA)  a measure of income to farmers before their produce is sold  to 2.1 per cent in 2017-18 from 4.9 per cent the previous year, according to the first advance estimates of national income 2017-18.The slowdown could be witnessed in Indias agricultural exports, which dipped to Rs 2.1 lakh crore, after growing more than five times over a decade ending 2014, while agricultural imports grew five times over the decade to 2015-16, Down To Earth reported on January 11, 2018.An agricultural slowdown has evident political implications: 49 per cent of landowning farmers voted for the BJP in 2014, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. A reminder came in December 2017 from Gujarat, where the BJP won by the narrowest margin in 22 years, winning fewer rural seats (43) than the Congress (62).Further evidence of farm distress is evident in rising agricultural loan defaults, loan waivers by state governments and farm suicides.Defaults, distress & suicidesAlongside record foodgrain and horticultural output in 2016-17, many Indian states were swept by farm agitations demanding higher prices for their produce from government and farm-loans waivers.One example is tur dal. After the monsoon of 2017, imports and a record harvest caused a glut that led to a fall in minimum support price (MSP)  the price at which the government purchases crops from farmers leading to unrest and stress in rural Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Gujarat, IndiaSpend reported on June 8, 2017.A similar glut in potatoes crashed prices in Uttar Pradesh (UP), prompting farmers to dump produce on roads statewide, The Hindu reported on January 13, 2018. Such situations spur agrarian unrest. India witnessed an almost eight-fold increase in agrarian riots between 2014 and 2016, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. In July 2017, five farmers were killed in police firing during a protest seeking farm-loan waivers and higher produce prices, the Hindustan Times reported on July 17, 2017.As distress grew, so did farmer suicides, which increased 42 per cent in 2015 over the previous year, IndiaSpend reported on January 2, 2017. Indebtedness was a major reason for farmer suicides. Nearly four in ten of 8,007 Indian farmers who committed suicide in 2015 were in debt, compared to two in ten in 2014; more rural households went into debt over 11 years; and the average rural household had borrowed Rs 1.03 lakh, according to a January 2018 IndiaSpend analysis of government data.Nearly 70 per cent of Indias 90 million agricultural households spend more than they earn on average each month, IndiaSpend reported on June 21, 2017.In 2017, with farmers in eight states demanding loan waivers, Indias potential cumulative loan waiver was Rs 3.1 lakh crore ($49.1 billion), or 2.6 per cent of Indias gross domestic product in 2016-17, almost equal to Indias defence budget of Rs 3.6 lakh crore ($53.5 billion) for 2017-18.The loan write-offs caused non-performing assets (NPA)  or bad debts  related to agriculture to increase three-fold over three years to 2012-13, according to a 2017 report commissioned by the government.A major reason for persistent farm distress and the debt-and-death cycle is that 52 per cent of Indias farms depends on increasingly erratic monsoon rains.Despite normal monsoon, 8 states drought-affectedAlthough 2017 was classified as a normal monsoon, eight states were declared drought-affected, The Economic Times reported on April 6, 2017, revealing the vulnerability of Indias farms to uncertain rainfall in an era of climate change. Despite spending Rs 3.51 lakh croreequivalent to the farm-loan waivers demanded in 2017over 67 years, no more than 48 per cent of nearly 201 million hectares of farmland is irrigated.The government intended to invest about Rs 50,000 crore over five years to 2019-20 through the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojanathe Prime Ministers Irrigation Programmeto reach its target of water for every farm.But the programme was modified to revive 99 moribund small and medium irrigation projects in 2016-17, Down to Earth reported on January 19, 2018.As production rises, so will the demand for water for irrigation, estimated to grow from 910 billion cubic meter in 2015 to 1,072 billion cubic meter in 2050. Irrigation requires more water than drinking water, industry and energy needs. Over a decade to 2011, water available per capita fell 15 per cent, IndiaSpend reported on August 2, 2017.Without a long-term budgetary plan, planning for sustainable groundwater management and conjunctive use using ground and surface water  India will face a water shortage.As the water crisis grows, programmes like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana  Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Programme  started in 2016 to insure farmers and provide financial support after natural calamities, pest or disease outbreaks, could be redundant.As excessive extraction of groundwater makes water scarce for agriculture, it may be outside the ambit of schemes like PMFBY to provide farmers insurance against crop failure.There is a need to ensure that farm production is linked to various markets for farmers to recover full value of the quantity produced. This will incentivise the farmer to adopt improved farm technology and management practices for higher productivity, according to the Dalwai Committee report. This requires better storage and warehousing facilities.Better storage will reduce foodgrain wastageAbout 60,000 tonnes of foodgrain was wasted between 2011-16 in warehouses run by the state-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI). This means the grain either rots or is eaten by rodents and other animals.FCI stocks classified as damaged dropped from 18,847 tonnes to 8,776 tonnes over two years to 2016-17, according to this August 8, 2017, government response to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. That is still 731 truckloads  using a 12-tonne truck  of wasted foodgrain every year.Indias cold-storage capacity for fruits and vegetables increased by 8 per cent to 346 lakh metric tonnes over three years to 2017. This should allow farmers to reduce time to market and ensure better quality.(Paliath is an analyst with IndiaSpend, a data-driven, public-interest journalism non-profit)"
41,In Lucknow  a crop crisis of plenty,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-lucknow-a-crop-crisis-of-plenty/article22539233.ece,2018-01-28,The Hindu,"Potato farmers in Uttar Pradesh have a twin crisis on their hands  they brought in a record production of the crop but that has led to a slump in rates.What happened?On January 6, several quintals of potatoes were found strewn outside the Uttar Pradesh Assembly as well as near the Chief Ministers residence, in what appeared to be a mark of protest by distressed farmers. The BJP government dismissed the incident as a politically motivated conspiracy and filed an FIR against unknown persons. It also suspended five policemen for negligence. A few days later, the police arrested two persons linked to the Samajwadi Party from Kannauj on charges of conspiracy. However, the entire fiasco brought the much-needed focus on the dilemma faced by potato farmers.Why have prices fallen?Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of potatoes in the country and in the 2016-17 season, it broke the previous records, growing 155 lakh metric tonnes. A record 120 lakh tonnes was also stored in the 1,708 cold storages in the State. But rather than bringing cheer, the bumper crop led to a fall in prices. The newly elected Yogi Adityanath government stepped in to launch a market intervention scheme in April, under which one lakh tonnes of potatoes would be purchased from growers at the minimum support price of Rs. 487 a quintal. However, farmers are not satisfied.What are the problems?The grievances of farmers revolve around high input costs and low and unpredictable rates.First, farmers say the minimum support rate set by the government is too low; the cost of growing a quintal of potato, including expenditure on transport and cold storage rent, comes up to Rs. 800-900. They are demanding that the minimum support price be increased to Rs. 1,000. Second, farmers claim the government did not actively purchase their produce as promised. Even in cases where the State purchased the potatoes, the farmers complained that the purpose was counter-productive due to the grading system, under which only the best quality was selected by government agencies. The bulk of average-poor quality potatoes was left with the farmers, who had the option of selling it in the market and dumping the rest in cold storages. Horticulture Department Director S.K. Joshi, however, says the State purchased 12,937 tonnes from farmers during April-May, causing the market price to increase by Rs. 100 a quintal.Where to store the excess?The new produce from 2017 is already in the market even as cold storages are still flush with last years yield. Already bearing the loss of the input costs, farmers are faced with the dilemma of letting their produce rot in the storages or attempt to sell the old produce at throwaway prices in markets, while competing with the new potato. Many farmers chose to let their produce rot in the cold storages or threw them in their fields for cattle to eat, as the costs of transporting them to the market to sell at low prices was unfeasible. As farmers are unable to repay the cold storage rents, they too face losses as they have to incur operational costs.Authorities, however, say the potatoes being dumped by farmers are the rotting old stock, which would have been cleared from the cold storages sooner or later.What happens next?The State has sent a proposal to the Centre for purchasing 2 lakh tonnes from farmers under the market intervention scheme for the new season. Once the Centre approves the rates proposed by the State, the Horticulture Department will start buying potatoes from farmers in districts where rates are lower than the minimum support price. Last year, purchasing was done in 41 districts. Potatoes for the new season are still being dug out and the situation will be clear by February-end.OMAR RASHID"
42,From Plate to Plough: How to help theÂ farmer,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-to-help-the-farmer-telangana-input-support-scheme-5042721/,2018-01-29,Indian Express,"With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. (Archive) With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. (Archive)Farm distress is likely to be one of the major focal points of the upcoming Union Budget. Agri-GDP growth has fallen to around 2 per cent per annum in the first four years of the Modi government; the real incomes of farmers have fallen as well. The growth in the agriculture sector is much below the Centres target and the government does not seem to be on course to double farmers incomes by 2022. With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. While some have announced loan waivers, others are trying to fix farmers woes emanating from tumbling farm prices. Here, we focus on two pilot projects to see if they can be scaled-up at the all India level.The first is the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), essentially a price deficiency payment (PDP) scheme, being undertaken by the government of Madhya Pradesh. BBY applies to eight kharif crops  soybean, maize, urad, tur, moong, groundnut, til, ramtil. The Haryana government has announced a somewhat similar scheme for four vegetables  potatoes, onions, tomatoes and cauliflower. The second pilot scheme we talk about is underway in Telangana, where the government gives all farmers an investment support for their working capital needs.Under the BBY, farmers have to first register on a portal. Their sown area is verified by government officials. They are then asked to bring their produce to mandis at a time fixed by the state government. Based on average productivity of a crop in the district and area cultivated by the farmer, the quantity of each produce that is eligible for deficiency payment is also determined by the government. Farmers receive the difference between average sale price (ASP) and MSP directly into their bank accounts. The scheme seems interesting as it provides an alternative to physical procurement of commodities at minimum support prices (MSPs). The ASP is calculated as the simple average of the weighted modal prices of the relevant crops in the regulated mandis of Madhya Pradesh and two adjoining states. The price information is drawn from the Centres agmarknet.gov.in portal.For kharif 2017-18, so far, data related to five crops (soybean, maize, groundnut, urad and moong) has been finalised for price deficiency payment. The market prices of til and ramtil are higher than the MSP and therefore they do not qualify for price deficiency payment. The tur season will start from February.The graph shows the key results of BBY for October-December, 2017. It is interesting to note that only 32 per cent of urad production in Madhya Pradesh got the yojanas benefit despite the fact that ASP of urad was 42 per cent below its MSP. In other words, 68 per cent of urad production was sold at prices below MSP, without any compensation under BBY. In the case of soybean, the states prime kharif crop, the percentage of production benefiting from this scheme is even lower  only 18.5 per cent, despite its ASP being 12 per cent below the MSP. And for maize, groundnut and moong, the coverage is even poorer (see graph).Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much? Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much?The Madhya Pradesh government claims to have paid about Rs 1,900 crore as compensation to farmers for these five crops. But that pertains to only those farmers registered on its portal. A larger proportion of farmers are not registered on the portal and they have been selling their produce at huge losses. These farmers have not received any compensation. In fact, those not registered under BBY have to suffer bigger losses because traders are suppressing the market. We have calculated their loss by multiplying the production not covered under BBY with the price difference between MSP and ASP. The actual prices in Madhya Pradesh are even lower than the ASP, which is the average of modal prices of three states. The total loss for these five crops comes to Rs 6,534 crore. So, if the scheme was fully successful and covered entire production, the Madhya Pradesh governments revenue outgo would be Rs 8,434 crore, and not Rs 1,900 crore. This would be more than 90 per cent of the states total budget for agriculture. In sum, BBY is not inclusive, covers less than 25 per cent of the farmers loss, involves too much micro-management by government officials and is prone to market manipulation.Haryanas scheme for four vegetables is even worse as the presumed MSP (Rs 400 per quintal for potatoes and tomatoes and Rs 500 per quintal for onions and cauliflower) does not even cover the full cost of production as estimated by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and the National Horticulture Board for these crops.In contrast to these programmes is the government of Telanganas input support scheme. Announced in the second week of January, the schemes objective is to relieve farmers from taking loans from moneylenders by giving them Rs 4,000 per acre for the kharif and rabi seasons. It is envisaged that the farmer will use this money for purchase of inputs ranging from seeds to fertilisers to machinery and hired labour. The area eligible for investment support is 14.21 million acre  the governments annual bill for the project, thus, comes to around Rs 5,685 crore.The Telangana model does not require the farmer to register his cultivated area and crops. The farmer is free to grow a crop of his choice and sell it anytime in a mandi of his choice. This model is crop-neutral, more equitable, more transparent, and gives farmers the freedom to choose. Incidentally, China has a similar scheme: It gives aggregate input subsidy support on a per acre basis. The scheme does not distort markets and is worth following. Will the Union Budget make such a bold move to redress farmers woes?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
43,Glut: Abandoned Plots Turn into Potato Dumps,https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/glut-abandoned-plots-turn-into-potato-dumps/story-AVOKoteBB5GQG9wJ7bGx7L.html,2018-01-30,Hindustan Times,"Due to the ongoing slump in the price of potato in the wholesale market, farmers have started dumping large quantities of potato on open spaces instead of selling the crop in the market. Reason: Owing to surplus potatoes in the national market, the price remained around Rs 2 per kg, which is the lowest of the season, leaving the farmers with no choice but to take their potato stocks from cold stores and dumping them away.Reports in this regard have come from various parts of the state, including the Dera Bassi, Banur and Rajpura belts. Sacks full of potatoes can be seen dumped near Chhatt village right along the Zirakpur-Patiala highway.With potato production costing Rs 5 per kg, farmers say no one is ready to sell the crop at Rs 2 per kg in the market because selling the potatoes at such low price cannot even cover transportation, labour and gunny bag cost.The ban on the export of potato to Pakistan, where the crop was fetching price as good as Rs 10 per kg, has added to the woes of farmers.  Jang Bhadhur Sangha, potato farmer, JalandharTheir plightDidar Singh, a potato farmer from Shatabgarh village of Dera Bassi, said, Keeping a 50-kg bag of potato in a cold store costs Rs 120 for a full season. A gunny bag costs about Rs 20 and labour cost for filling, loading and transporting the potato-filled bag costs Rs 25.This way, a 50-kg bag costs us Rs 165 in total. However, in the wholesale market, the bag fetches only Rs 120-130. With such a negative return, majority of farmers prefer not to lift their crop from the cold stores, he said.Another farmer from Shatabgarh village, Dasmesh Singh, said, As farmers neither pay the rent of keeping the potato in cold stores nor come to lift their stock, the owners of stores are forced to just dump the potato away on open spaces. And sometimes, farmers themselves throw the potato away in open spaces instead of taking the crop to the market.Mohali, India January 28: Potato dumped road side in village Chatt in Mohali on Sunday, January 28, 2018.Photo by Ravi Kumar/Hindustan Times (Ravi Kumar/HT)Farmers refuse to pick stockThe slump in potato prices has also caused huge losses to the owners of various cold stores, including those of the big cold stores in the 7-km stretch from Jhungian to Jhansla village.Claiming to have suffered losses worth Rs 50 lakh, Manjit Singh, owner of Baba Ajit Singh cold store in Jhungian village,said, Around 500 farmers had kept their potato stock at my store. Out of these, only 200 farmers have lifted their stock. The remaining just refused to pick up their stock, due to which I had no choice but to dump the rest of the stock as the store needs to be cleaned for the next season.One-month electricity bill of my cold store is around Rs 5 lakh. Besides, I have to pay the salaries of my workers too, Singh said.Govt of no help eitherA leading potato farmer in the country,Jang Bhadhur Sangha of Jalandhar, said, The central government had prepared a market intervention scheme to support the market at the time of slump in price of farmers' produce. However, knowing that there is huge price slump due to surplus potato production, the government did not care to intervene. This has left the farmers to fend for themselves. They have no alternative but to dump their stock.Sangha also pointed out how ban on the export of potato to Pakistan, where the crop was fetching price as good as Rs 10 per kg, has added to the woes of farmers. Export to Pakistan would have helped with the profit from potato in the domestic market as the surplus stock in Pakistani market had exhausted, he said.He said they had asked the Union government through multiple channels to allow export of potato, but to no avail."

This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul) With farm incomes for crops like paddy coming down, farmers are going for cash crops like mustard and potato in West Bengal Howrah district. This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul)A drop in potato production from last years 110 lakh tonne to 80-100 lakh tonne this year is anticipated, but is unlikely to impact the staple crops prices, officials said.Speaking at the 53rd Annual General Meeting of West Bengal Cold Storage Association (WBCSA) in Kolkata on Monday, state Agricultural Marketing Minister Tapan Dasgupta and WBCSA president Patit Paban De shared the view that potato prices would not be hit due to an excess stock of about 9 lakh tonne from last year.Production of potatoes will be lesser in comparison to last year, but it will still be far more than the average consumption of the state. Also, last years stock will help in keeping the price of potatoes in check, said De.The area of cultivation for potatoes has been reduced by five per cent in the state this year. As per sources, the average land allocated for potato cultivation is around 4.6 lakh hectares, but this will be reduced to 4.4 lakh hectares this season.At present, out of 575 cold storage units in the state, 460 are dedicated to storage of potatoes. With a capacity of 70 lakh MT (metric tonne) and enhanced efficiency, these units have adequate space to store the states entire production. However, high crop production across the country severely impacted the market, and despite efforts from all parties involved, the stock of potatoes kept in cold storage could not be fully sold. This despite extending the normal period of storage till December, officials said.Pointing out that the annual consumption of potatoes in the state is around 65 lakh tons, including seeds, De appealed to the state government to encouraging marketing of the crop in neighbouring states and abroad right after the start of the season.We request government authorities to make timely plans for marketing of excess produce to avoid distress sales. Most of the old cold storage units operate with bank loans for various purposes. However, due to insufficient rent recovery, many are unable to repay the loans. We submit a rent revision prayer to the government every year. The current rate is Rs 152 per quintal for North Bengal and Rs 148 per quintal for South Bengal. We will try to bring it to Rs 180 per quintal, he said.When asked about this, Dasgupta told The Indian Express, They havent applied to us yet. However, rent revision depends on the instructions given by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee We will ensure farmers get their dues. Last year, there was excessive stock, hence they didnt get good money.The minister also said the government is encouraging cold storage owners to turn to solar power.In order to maintain an eco-friendly environment, we are encouraging them to install solar power Solar units will reduce the operating cost. So far, this has been initiated in 10 cold storage units in Midnapore, Bankura, Hooghly, etc he said.However, De pointed out that investing in solar power units was a costly endeavour.To run a cold storage 200 kWh solar unit, Rs 1 crore is necessary. However, in absence of any subsidy for such a huge investment, there is a remote possibility of installing such units using ones own funds.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

We consider agriculture as an enterprise, and want to help the farmers produce more from the same land parcel at lesser cost and simultaneously realise higher prices for their produce, he said.To this end, one initiative will be a food processing thrust called Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to promote tomato, onion and potato cultivation and availability around the year.Operation Green shall promote farmer-producer organisations, agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional managements.I propose to allocate Rs 500 crore for this purpose, Jaitley said, pointing out that seasonal and regional production of these commodities make it difficult to connect farmers and consumers.Among other measures: Rs 10,000 crore corpus for animal husbandry infrastructure fund, and an aquaculture infrastructure fund. Kisan credit cards to be extended to animal husbandry and fisheries sector. National bamboo mission to be restructured, with outlay of Rs 1290 crore. Institutional credit to agriculture to be raised to Rs 11 lakh crore in 2018-19. 22,000 rural haats to be upgraded to grameen agricultural markets. These haats will be exempt from the rules of the APMCs or Agricultural Produce Market Committees."
46,Budget 2018-19: a gulf between rhetoric and reality,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/657217/budget-2018-19-gulf-rhetoric.html,2018-02-01,Deccan Herald,"There was a lot of speculation about the Union Budget as this was the last full-year budget before general elections and the first one after GST reform was unveiled. There were questions on whether the government will roll out an election budget or stick to fiscal discipline. The middle class was hoping for tax concessions. Speculation was that the government would address farm distress, particularly after the disaffection shown by farmers in the Gujarat election. More importantly, the industry was looking for measures to improve investment climate.The Economic Survey had presented a picture of cautious optimism. Its estimate of GDP for the current fiscal and projection for the next year can be termed as aspirational. To achieve a growth rate of 6.75% this year would require the economy to grow at 7.5% in the second half of the year. Similarly, the assumption of growth of 7-7.5% for the next year is more a hope and not grounded in hard facts. The Survey went on to list recapitalisation of public sector banks along with reforms in their governance, implementation of insolvency and bankruptcy code to resolve bad debts, ensuring macro-stability, privatisation of Air India and stabilisation of GST as the major reforms agenda for the year. Not that all these have to be addressed by the budget as policy-making is done throughout the year.The budget presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley once again shows a disconnect with the Economic Survey. In many ways, it is an election budget. The focus of the budget is stated to be ""strengthening agriculture and rural economy, provision of good healthcare to the economically less-privileged, taking care of senior citizens, infrastructure creation, working with the states to provide more resources for improving the quality of education in the country"". The finance minister devoted a considerable part of the speech to elaborate the measures to achieve them. In the case of farmers, the welfare is proposed to be improved by ensuring minimum support prices at 150% of the cost of cultivation. There are measures to upgrade the rural haats into Gramin Agricultural Markets, creation of a market infrastructure fund, creation of all-weather roads, incentive for marketing and processing, an 'Operation Greens' for storage and processing of potatoes and onions, creation of micro-irrigation fund, increasing the institutional credit allocation from Rs 10 lakh crore in 2017-18 to Rs 11 lakh crore for 2018-19. There is also a favourable tax treatment for Farmer Producers' Organisations.About eight crore poor women are to be given free gas connections and increased allocation of free cooking gas, and four crore households are to be given free electricity connections. There is also a laudable objective of providing a roof over the heads of every poor person by 2022. There are a number of schemes to improve the quality of education, such as improving the quality of teachers, setting up of Ekalavya schools, creation of institutions of eminence, launching a Prime Minister's Research Fellows scheme.In the healthcare sector, it is proposed to create 1.5 lakh wellness centres to bring the healthcare system closer to people, increase the coverage under the Rashtriya Swastya Bima Yojana to cover 10 crore poor families and increasing the coverage to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 30,000 currently, under what's now called National Health Protection Scheme.There are measures to promote small and medium enterprises, through credit support capital and interest subsidy, measures have also been announced to incentivise creation of formal employment by contributing to employees' provident fund and tax concessions. There are proposals to strengthen infrastructure including the transportation system comprising of railways, suburban rail and roads. It has also chosen 14 Central Public Sector Enterprises for listing on the stock exchanges, strategic disinvestment of 24 enterprises, including Air India, and merging the public sector general insurance companies. Bank recapitalisation is to be pursued by issuing bonds amounting to Rs 80,000 crore.Deficit credibilityA closer look at the proposals in terms of budget allocation, however, is disappointing. Most of the proposed objectives are supposed to be achieved from extra-budgetary sources and not budget allocation. Total expenditure for 2018-19 is expected to be higher than the revised estimates for 2017-18 by 10.1% and capital expenditure increase is estimated at 9.9%. In fact, capital expenditure as a ratio of GDP at 1.6% is the lowest since 2014-15. Except for food subsidy, which is estimated to increase by 19.4% over 2017-18 due to the proposed increase in minimum support prices, the outlays on all other expenditure categories show only marginal increases.On the fiscal front, there are matters of serious concern. If the GDP estimate released by the Central Statistical Organisation on January 31 is correct, the fiscal deficit for 2016-17 works out to 3.7%, and not 3.5% as is shown in the budget. Thus, there seems to be slippage even in 2016-17. The slippages in 2017-18 are in respect of every deficit measure. The fiscal deficit is at 3.5% as compared to the 2017-18 budget estimate of 3.2%.What is alarming is that the gains in compressing the revenue deficit since 2014-15 has been completely wiped out as the revised estimate of revenue deficit in 2017-18 at 2.6% is significantly higher than not only the budget estimate for the year (1.9%) but also that of 2015-16 (2.5%). This slippage is seen in Effective Revenue Deficit and Primary Deficit as well.In other words, the government, while extolling the need to maintain fiscal disciple and advancing the fiscal adjustment path in the Medium Term Fiscal Plan has been continuously shifting the goalpost. This raises the question of credibility.(The writer was a Member of the Fourteenth Finance Commission and is currently Emeritus Professor, NIPFP)"
47,"Hiking crop MSP impractical, say UP farmers",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/hiking-crop-msp-impractical-say-up-farmers/articleshow/62752911.cms,2018-02-02,The Times Of India,"MEERUT/BAREILLY: Union finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday announced that the minimum support price (MSP) for notified kharif crops would be 1.5 times the cost incurred by farmers for its production. Farmers in Uttar Pradesh , however, said increasing the MSP was impractical as there was no way to calculate the exact cost of the crop. Industry associations, too, were unhappy with various provisions.National convenor of Azad Kisan Union , Rajendra Singh, said, Government says it will give one-and-a-half times the cost incurred by the farmer on his crop. But there is no way that cost can be calculated. Will it include yearly wages? Will the rent of land be included for landless farmers? If not, then this promise will be an empty one.""National spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union Rakesh Tikait said, Raising MSP isnt the solution. The government needs to look into farmers basic problems. A national committee on agriculture to look into these problems is yet to see the light of day.VM Singh, national convenor of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, said, We have several doubts over the governments intention. First, raising MSP of crops was a poll promise of the BJP in the 2014 LS polls. It has come four years late? Second, there is no mention of marginal farmers who grow vegetables and suffer the most. UPs recent potato crisis is a case in example. Yashpal Malik , a farmer-leader in west UP, said it was more important to ensure that benefits reach farmers rather than raising the MSP. MSPs were increased by previous governments too. But red-tapism didnt allow farmers to sell their crops at those rates. Those leakages need to be plugged first, he said.Chairman of Meerut chapter of Indian Industries Association, Atul Gupta, said, There is no mention of simplification of GST provisions which have crippled the industry. Though the FM has announced a package of Rs 3,794 crore for credit support in the MSME sector, there is no talk on the much-needed simplification of archaic laws and tedious procedures. Is that the ease of doing business?"
48,Union Budget 2018: A StepÂ Forward,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/arun-jaitley-union-budget-2018-a-step-forward-5048248/,2018-02-02,Indian Express,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley before presenting Union Budget 2018 before the Parliament (Express Photo by Renuka Puri) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley before presenting Union Budget 2018 before the Parliament (Express Photo by Renuka Puri)All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. In Anna Karenina, only if a person is satisfied on all counts will she be happy. The allocations in the budget cover every sector, with umpteen implications, and no persons expectations can be fulfilled on all counts. While every expectation cant be met, it must be acknowledged that Finance Minister (FM) Arun Jaitley has presented a budget which focuses on rural India and is a great leap forward for the policy-battered farm sector. According to Article 112 of the Constitution, the Union Budget is simply a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditures of the government for a particular year.Rather than the budget being an annual jamboree for announcing policies, the prime minister should address the nation with his ideas for the coming year, based on which the FM should subsequently present the budget. The first step towards atonement and for penance is to acknowledge past failure. As the Economic Survey rightly states, real incomes of farmers have been stagnant. The next step is to take corrective measures and redeem the situation. An effort has been initiated in that direction in this budget.Assurance of purchase of all crops for which MSP is declared is a positive step. If the governments promise is of A2+50 per cent profit, then it is half-baked. It should have simultaneously announced acceptance of the Ramesh Chand Committees recommendations on the calculation of MSP, which it has not. The Niti Aayog is finally evolving into the credible policy think-tank we had been hoping for. It is also supposed to come out with a suitable mechanism to enable institutional credit access to lessee farmers.The Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund, with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore, is to be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the 22,000 Gramin Agricultural Markets and 585 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). This will enable farmers in remote locations who are devoid of any institutional mechanism to connect to markets. Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to tackle the volatility of tomato, onion and potato prices is a positive development. The long-standing demand of income tax exemption for farmer producer organisations has been fulfilled. A Rs 10,000 crore fund to finance the infrastructure requirements of fisheries, aquaculture and animal husbandry will generate rural employment and supplement farmer incomes.The intent to mitigate the air pollution woes of Delhi-NCR by subsidising the machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue has now been addressed. Targeted programmes like those under the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna for 96 irrigation-deprived districts, where less than 30 per cent of the land holdings get assured irrigation, is the way forward. The focus on horticulture clusters and converting cattle dung and solid waste in farms to compost, fertiliser, biogas and bio-CNG is also commendable.Read | Budget 2018 explained: Arun Jaitleys budget has no creative incrementalism on showThe flagship National Health Protection Scheme to cover over 50 crore poor and vulnerable beneficiaries providing coverage upto Rs 5 lakh per family per year for hospitalisation is outstanding. But the fund allocation for the programme is insignificant. I wonder if it will suffer the fate of many of last years budget announcements which have not materialised due to lack of allocations. In Davos, there was a general scepticism regarding the data presented to project the Indian growth story. A similar apprehension persists regarding the fund allocations in this budget.Climate change worries have not been addressed as agriculture R&D has been ignored. Nor is there a mention of the balanced use of fertilisers. The magic-bullet demand for changing the Centre-state funding ratio from 60:40 to 90:10 for agriculture-related schemes has unfortunately been overlooked.A constant red thread running uniformly through the budgets of the past 10 years, presented by three finance ministers of India, is that farmer suicides have not abated. In the last three years, over 36,000 farmers have committed suicide.Power is the capacity to change the lives of people. The prime minister must direct his immense power to bring the sorry saga of farmer suicides to an end. Budget allocations serve as the perfect instrument to change the narrative of resentment to one of hope. He must quickly solve farmers crises or heed the warning, given in different circumstances, by Benjamin Franklin: We must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
49,â€˜Little done to manage climate change in relation to farmingâ€™,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/little-done-to-manage-climate-change-in-relation-to-farming/articleshow/62750752.cms,2018-02-02,The Times Of India,"One of the weaker sections of the economy is agriculture which provides employment to 49% of the population, agriculture scientist M S Swaminathan said, adding that contribution of agriculture to GDP has been going down and is now at 16%.Here is what he has to say about the budget: Both climate variability and market volatility affect the income of farmers. The Economic Survey points out that farm income may decline by more than 4% in a year. Heavy rainfall reduces income by 13.7% and 5.5% for kharif and rabi crops respectively.The budget provides for greater use of clean and renewable energy sources but does not deal with the management of climate change in relation to farming. It is important to set up climate risk management R&D centres at the block level. Such centres should be supported by trained climate risk managers. Climate change could become a mega catastrophe and there is need for immediate steps both in the areas of mitigation and adaptation The budget has provisions which can insulate farmers from distress sale and poor income . The finance minister has announced minimum support price (MSP) for all unannounced crops of kharif at one-and-a-half times of their production cost. If income is less than the support price, the government has said that it will make efforts to buy the surplus produce of the farmers.More allocation will be made for building warehouses and for upgrading 22,000 rural haats into grameen agricultural markets. The budget sets apart 2,000 crore for an agricultural market and infrastructure fund. Several steps have been proposed for promoting sustainable agriculture such as organic farming. Horticulture will be promoted with greater attention to the marketing of tomato, potato and onion and similar perishable commodities through operation greens with 500 crore allocation.Another welcome feature is to integrate attention to fisheries and animal husbandry with kissan credit cards.The national bamboo mission will be restructured in order to enhance the cultivation and consumption of bamboo products. The emphasis placed on self help group formation, cooperatives and other organisational methods which can provide the power of scale to the small scale producers is welcome.The priority given to rural infrastructure and irrigation will help impart stability of income and employment. Malnutrition is another serious problem and we need to promote symbiotic linkages among agriculture, nutrition and health.On the whole, the budget addresses some of the hotspots in the field of farming, the most important being the management of the monsoon and the market."
50,Very Little for MSME Sector: Indian Industries Association,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/very-little-for-msme-sector-indian-industries-association/story-fUZl9mrdqbc7WdiwDcMcwN.html,2018-02-02,Hindustan Times,"The Indian Industries Association (IIA), a prominent industry lobby group, has said the budget has nothing for the micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, which comprises a bulk of industrial units.Although a lot of measures have been proposed for the poor and farmers in the budget, there is very little for the MSME sector, said Sunil Vaish, president of the IIA.We were expecting further reduction in corporate tax for the MSME sector in this budget, he added.In last years budget, the finance minister had said corporate tax will be reduced in a phased manner. At that time, it was reduced to 25 % for business houses having a turnover up to Rs 50 crore, benefiting the MSME sector.But in the union budget for 2018-19, the tax benefit has been extended to larger business units having an annual turnover up to Rs 250 crore.Vaish also said, It has been announced that bank loans to the MSMEs will be sanctioned online. Yet, the MSME sector is doubtful in view of the attitude of banks towards it.Moreover, the online systems are not reliable at present as is being experienced in the case of the GST, he said.Today, reports have come in from various chapters of the IIA that the online e-way bill system is not properly operational, he added.Vaish, however, said the decision to set up mega food park and provide incentives for the apparel and leather sector will give a boost to the MSME sector.Manmohan Agarwal, the IIA vice-president, said the emphasis on road and health infrastructure and improvement in the education system would indirectly help the MSME sector.CONSUMER DEMAND TO GET A BOOST: ASSOCHAM PRESIDENTSandeep Jajodia, the Assocham president, said the finance minister had placed much emphasis on agriculture and rural India, allocating bulk of resources to interior landscape, while helping the middle class salaried employees along with giving relief to senior citizens. These measures will boost consumer demand and help revive economic growth, he said.The budget is on expected lines and provides support to sections of the society where it was needed the most. The agriculture and rural landscape were in some kind of distress and provision of over Rs 14.34 lakh crore on rural infrastructure should also add to employment generation, especially in the farm sector, Jajodia added.Relief to salaried employees by way of Rs 40,000 per annum standard deduction in lieu of transport allowance and medical reimbursement will leave more disposable income in the hands of the middle class and boost consumer demand, he said.Initiatives like Operation Green to stabilise prices of onion and potato will help ease retail inflation and help the RBI in keeping interest rates on the lower side, Jajodia said.MANY MEASURES IN LINE WITH CII RECOMMENDATIONSChandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said: Many of the measures in the budget are in line with the CIIs recommendations such as incentives for new jobs, extending fixed term employment, enhancing quality of education including teacher training and addressing healthcare access.Overall, this is a balanced and prudent budget that sets the foundation for future growth in the economy, he said."
51,'Finance Minister Must Clarify What Cost Yardstick Will Be Used on MSPs',https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finance-minister-must-clarify-what-cost-yardstick-will-be-used-on-msps/story-kbL12IB7PHfMRH8bLNDY9I.html,2018-02-03,Hindustan Times,"In his Budget speech, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government declared minimum support price (MSP) for the majority of rabi crops at least at one-and-a-half times the cost involved. This claim requires clarity, says Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture, in an interview with Zia Haq. Kuruganti was a member of the Ramesh Chand Committee on farm prices.The FM announced MSPS will be set at 1.5 times over costs of production, or 50% returns. He hasnt clarified if this increase will be over the so called C2 costs of cultivation, which is the main demand, or A2 costs. Can you explain why this is vital?In terms of cost accounting principles and practice, it is important to get a comprehensive picture of costs, which include opportunity costs. That will then give you a good picture of net returns. The Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices itself calculates net returns in terms of C2 cost and not A2 (paid out components + family labour). C2 is a cost estimation, which (unlike A2) also includes rental value of own land and value of owned fixed capital assets. The reason why the government should exclude these two additional components also -while it includes imputed family labour on own land -in its selective cost definition, is irrational. Meanwhile, in the Ramesh Chand Committee report, we pointed out to various other ways in which cost is suppressed. That needs to be addressed too.People have argued that farmers costs are underestimated.While that is the theoretical part of the issue at debate here, what is important to realise is that official data is clearly showing that our farmers are in distress. Their income is not growing. A majority of farmers has negative net returns. The intersectoral disparities are increasing, which are not good in any society. There is also a moral imperative, that farmers are keeping us all alive, and we owe it to them.So are you saying the MSP claim is misleading?Prices are clearly the most proximal and direct ways to improve incomes. The government should stop trying to cheat farmers here. This government has given significantly lower margins on an average, whichever cost definition you adopt, compared to the earlier government. This, despite explicitly promising at least 50% margins over the cost of production. They have to make good on their promises.What are the kind of returns farmers are now getting? In terms of the ground reality, is it true that MSPS for the current rabi sown season gave 50% returns, as claimed by the finance minister?The NSSOS (National Sample Survey Office) 70th round shows that most farmers have monthly incomes lower than their monthly basic expenses. The average per day per capita earning in our farm households is lower than the legally prescribed minimum wages for agricultural workers in the country. The finance minister made an incorrect statement when he said that in this rabi, they have provided 50% margins since wheat, which had the highest MSP rise, has just 38% margin over C2 costs of cultivation. Not a single rabi crop has touched a 50% margin over C2.Would you agree that this Budget has put the rural economy and agriculture back on the governments priority?I will not agree. It is true that the current farmers unrest and struggles, in addition to recent election results, have put farmers back on the national debate, but the government hasnt incorporated any concrete thing that would address farmers problems. Only 2.3% of the entire budget has been given to agriculture. In fact, this government is being unresponsive and irresponsible towards farmers.Do you think Operation Greens for higher values through processing from tomato, onions and potatoes is a step towards focusing on incomes end of the spectrum?The details of this are yet to be seen. What we have been asking for is an MSP for these perishables also, which is guaranteed to farmers, in a statutory manner, along with other agri commodities."
52,Centre removes MEP on onions,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/centre-removes-mep-on-onions/articleshow/62765211.cms,2018-02-03,The Times Of India,"In a move that would bring smiles thousands of onion farmers , Centre on Friday evening removed Minimum Export Price (MEP) on onions. MEP is the minimum price below which exporters cant export onions.The step would help in arresting crash in wholesale onion prices, which has a detrimental effect on the prices that farmers get from selling their product. The notification issued by the director general of foreign trade of Union ministry of commerce, Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi , said that MEP on all varieties of onions stands removed and can be exported without MEP.A copy of the notification is in possession of TOI. Experts said that removal of MEP is the first step towards tackling the volatility in onion prices.The Union government in its budget presented on Thursday had announced launching of Operation Greens scheme to address price fluctuations in onions, potato and tomato for benefit of farmers and consumers with budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme for the fiscal 2018-19.For two years since December 24, 2015 there was no MEP of on onions.However Centre re-imposed MEP on onions on November 23 last year at USD 850 per tonne. Thereafter on January 19, Centre had also reduced the MEP on onions to USD 700 per tonne.The sources from the ministry of agriculture said, During the recent meeting with the officials from the ministry of commerce, it had already been decided to remove the MEP on onions if the average wholesale onion prices dropped below Rs 2,000 per quintal. Now, the average wholesale onion prices have already dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal. Hence, it had been immediately decided to remove the MEP of onions."

But officials and lawmakers say the outlook could change if the unpredictable U.S. leader turns his attention to Tokyo's 7 trillion yen ($63.62 billion)trade surplus ahead of U.S. congressional elections in November.""Naturally, America wants an early conclusion to what to do about its trade deficit (with Japan). Of course, they are concerned about the mid-term elections and may say various things, said a ruling party lawmaker well-versed in U.S.-Japan economic ties, one of eight officials and lawmakers interviewed by Reuters who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.""Suga is worried,"" he added, referring to Abes close aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.Efforts to showcase the US-Japan security alliance in the face of North Korea's nuclear and missile threats will probably take precedence over trade when U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visits Japan from Tuesday, officials on both sides said.Pence will not hold a formal third round of the so-called ""economic dialogue"" with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso while in Tokyo. The two last met for a second round in October, when, among other things, they agreed to lift restrictions on Japanese persimmon exports and US Idaho potato imports as well as streamline noise and emissions testing for US auto imports.""Japan's strategy could be said to be very simple - keep this channel of economic dialogue open,"" said one Japanese government source familiar with the government's thinking.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's comments late last month that a weak dollar would help US trade imbalances in the short term boosted the yen sharply against the dollar. It was a reminder of how currency could come into focus if trade friction revives.Japan is waiting to see what decision the White House takes on an inquiry into steel imports under Section 232 of a 1962 U.S. trade law allowing restrictions to protect national security. Action against an ally like Japan or South Korea, two of the sources said, could be problematic.Japan's largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal, has said Japanese exports are not hurting U.S. rivals. ""We hope the U.S. will make a wise decision,"" a company official said.William Hagerty, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, has said Washington wants to see progress on cutting Japan's trade surplus and forging a bilateral framework - which Tokyo opposes - by spring.Hagerty, in an interview with NHK last month, flagged liquefied natural gas (LNG), medicines and farm products as sectors where Washington wants to boost exports.Increasing LNG exports to Japan, however, could be tough: Japanese buyers have already agreed to buy more U.S. gas than they need. And boosting pharmaceutical exports would run up against Japan's efforts to cut drug prices to curb the rising medical costs of an ageing population.Washington also pushed again for fewer restrictions on beef shipments and auto exports during working-level talks in late January. Japanese officials argue such problems would have been resolved if the United States had remained in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal forged under Trump's predecessor.""We can say, 'Why did you leave TPP? If you were in TPP, these wouldn't be a problem,'"" the ruling party lawmaker said.Trump surprised many last month by saying he might be willing to rejoin the multilateral trade pact - if it were renegotiated to benefit the United States.Abe has rejected the idea of reopening talks on the delicately balanced pact, though some sources said Tokyo might eventually act as a bridge to lure Washington back with minor changes that Trump could sell back home as a victory.One option, sources said, is to present plans already in the works to buy more U.S. military gear as a gesture to please Trump, who brought up the sector during a November visit to Tokyo.Japan plans to buy 410.2 billion yen worth of US military equipment in the year starting in April and is working on a new five-year overall procurement plan that would start in 2019.Still, some politicians expressed frustration with a U.S. playbook that appears to hark back to the 1980s, when Japan accounted for a much bigger chunk of the U.S. trade deficit and its companies had yet to step up their direct investment in America.Trade in Japanese goods accounts for less than 10 percent of the U.S. deficit, compared with China's more than 40 percent.""When it comes to what to do in concrete terms, everyone is at a loss,"" the lawmaker said. ""The situation is completely different from the trade friction of the 1980s."""
54,Uttar Pradesh Set to Give Agri Sector Further Push,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-set-to-give-agri-sector-further-push/story-eEk6fDNRE7LSdCtlsLrm4I.html,2018-02-06,Hindustan Times,"With Uttar Pradeshs politics revolving mostly around the farm sector, the Yogi Adiyanath government faces the challenge of giving the farm and allied sectors a further boost ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the slew of measures announced in the Union budget for the welfare of farmers notwithstanding.And the government seems to be well aware of that and is expected to make more announcements to improve their lot in the annual budget for 2018-2019, likely to be presented in the UP assembly next week.Already, the farmers are on top of agenda of the government. We will ensure that farmers get remunerative prices. This will be done by setting up additional procurement centres for wheat and paddy, said minister for agriculture Surya Pratap Shahi.A committee of ministers has also been set up to look into the problems of potato growers. Measures will soon be initiated to improve their lot on the committees recommendations. We are focusing on diversification as farmers remain mostly focused on wheat and paddy crops. An amendment to Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) Act is being contemplated to reach out to the farmers to get them better prices for their produce. We want to double the income of farmers by 2022, said Shahi.An action plan that NITI Ayog formulated for Uttar Pradesh also refers to the proposed agriculture sector reforms. The plan also refers to the challenge of transforming the agriculture sector, that has not grown despite claims of successive governments, by addressing issues of low growth, low productivity and low income of farmers. It asks the state government to identify reasons for decrease in canal irrigated area from 32.1 lakh hectare in 1990s to 25.5 lakh hectare now and take appropriate action.A decrease in irrigated area assumes significance as the states backward regions like Bundelkhand have witnessed drought and a number of distressed farmers have reportedly committed suicide over the years. Bundelkhand has seen 411 suicides of farmers from January 2014 to June 28, 2016, said Saheb Lal Shukla, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhupendra Singh Mann group).But a change in the UP story is perhaps now showing. If claims of the officers of the agriculture department were to be believed, the state achieved 3.5 percent growth in the agriculture sector in 2014-2015. The sector may have grown further in the following years.After its installation on March 19, 2017, the Adityanath government had announced a number of measures for welfare of farmers. These included a loan waiver scheme involving an expenditure of Rs 36,000 crore for farmers in the states annual budget for 2017-2018.Earlier, the UPA government too had taken a number of initiatives for the farmers. A debt relief scheme for farmers was implemented across India during the UPA regime.

He accused Modi of forcing the farmers to commit suicide because they had no option but to sell their production at low prices.""In the last four years, 12,000 farmers have committed suicide. Condition of farmers is so pathetic that their sons are not getting married because of poor finances. All of the Prime Minister's promises are nothing but jumlas,"" said Raghuvansh.The senior RJD leader also claimed that around 8,000 hand pumps are defunct in Bihar. Addressing a news meet at the RJD office in Patna, Raghuvansh said farmers earlier would get subsidy of 90 per cent for borings but that has now been brought down to 50 per cent. This has meant farmers cannot install their own borings and irrigation is hit.He also attacked chief minister Nitish Kumar over paddy procurement. ""As the government did not procure paddy, farmers had to sell their produce at very low prices. The worst affected are potato farmers who have run away after dumping it in cold storage. In states like Uttar Pradesh, farmers threw away their potatoes on the road. The crop insurance and subsidy on diesel are just promises,"" Raghuvansh said.He asked the Prime Minister that if bank loans of farmers in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh were waived off why weren't Bihar farmers'.At Kisan Melas, farming machines are so expensive, Raghuvansh said, that farmers get no benefit of subsidy. So, he demanded pension for farmers on the pattern of government employees."

Had we tried ordering food from Taamonline, he wanted to know. Nice, genuine biryani, he said. And I swung into action.The moment I hear the word biryani I get activated, quite like Pavlov and dog. For someone who is essentially a wheat eater, I cant quite understand this great love I have for biryanis. But as I have said before, I truly enjoy this rice-and-meat dish  irrespective of where it is from. I love the spiciness of the Hyderabadi biryani, the richness of the Awadhi one, the more rustic taste of the Delhi version, the juicy potato in the Calcutta dish and the variations that you find in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. I dont even mind the pickled taste of the Moradabadi biryani.So, of course, I went online to get to know more about Taam.It turned out that it is a service which provides biryanis, kormas, kababs and other such delicious dishes in kilos.Diversity on tableBut a sampler came home, and I tried out quite a few of the dishes  and had a great meal, indeed.There was quite a spread  biryani, korma, kababs, baghare baigan, meethi roti and sewain. I think I enjoyed the lamb shami kababs the most  they were soft, the meat was deliciously tender and lightly spiced, and what I really liked was that they were not thick and chunky, as kababs often are, but thin, like home-cooked kababs. The kababs had been made with beaten meat and not minced meat, so they were exceptionally tasty. I ate a piece with a small chunk of the meethi roti, and found they complemented each other rather well.The Lucknowi biryani was good, too. The rice was long-grained, and the meat pieces were well cooked. It was rightly spiced  neither too much, nor too little.Nawabi dishThe mildly sweet taste of the Hyderabadi dish, baghare baigan, was delightful. The tamarind in it gave it the tart edge that it needed. But, somehow, the korma didnt work for me. I found the gravy too runny and the meat a little insipid. The Muzaffar sewain (Rs. 300 a box  450g and serves 7-8 people), on the other hand, was superb, and gave a pleasantly sweet end to what was a veritable feast.The rates are in kilos. The Lucknowi mutton biryani  which serves 5-6 people is for Rs. 1400 a kilo, the chicken biryani for Rs. 1200 a kilo. Hyderabadi mutton biryani is for Rs. 1600 a kilo and chicken biryani Rs. 1400 a kilo. The mutton qorma, which serves 10, is for Rs. 1800 a kilo. A plate of mutton shami kababs  one kilo with 40 pieces  costs Rs. 1500. The baghare baigan is for Rs. 1000 a kilo and serves 10, says the rate card.Taam is an online platform run by Asra Ahmad. It takes orders on phone and online. The phone numbers are 8586030554 and 9953170590. The email id is order@taamonline.com, and the website is www.taamonline.com. You have to order your food at least a day in advance, and they take delivery charges as applicable. The bawarchis of Taam have been trained by the family, and a cook is there from Hyderabad as well.My friend from Bhopal was not wrong. You wont be disappointed, he had said. And I certainly wasnt."

The name of the Jan Aahar is Pappu-Ranjeet Jan Aahar Canteen which already has a branch in Madhepura (Ranjeet Ranjan is the wife of Pappu and an MP from Supaul).It is not a permanent structure and has been opened in an open van which has been converted into a kitchen. At one time, at least 16 people can have food sitting on chairs as arrangement of tables has also been made.People can have as much as they wish to but they will have to eat the food there itself. Only vegetarian food will be served and the timing would from 10am to 9pm. There are three cooks and two helpers who are looking after the entire set-up in which Rs 5 lakh has been spent.The canteen will remain closed every Sunday and the quality of the food will be regularly checked through random inspections by Pappu. The cleanliness has also been taken into consideration and two big garbage boxes have been placed near the van apart from safe drinking water.Every day, the menu will change and breakfast, lunch and dinner will be served, all available for Rs 20. At one time, it has the capacity to serve food to at least 500 people.On the first day, around 150 people had food till evening, including the Madhepura MP, who also ate puri, mixed vegetable and a potato preparation.""The idea of opening the canteen for the common man came to my mind when I was informed that under the food security bill, only 4 per cent foodgrain reach the common people. Even students are unable to afford nutritious food. Then I thought of opening this canteen,"" Pappu said after inaugurating the canteen.Pappu said in the coming days, four more Jan Aahar canteens will be opened in the state capital at different locations where people can have sumptuous food at low price.On politics over opening the canteen, Pappu said: ""Amma Canteen and Indira Canteen were launched with political motives but I am only serving the poor. There is no politics behind opening the canteen.""Even students and passersby praised the initiative saying Pappu had done a good thing without any vested interest.Bimal Kumar, a student of BN College, said: ""In today's time, it is not possible to fill your stomach for Rs 20. Even the roadside food costs between Rs 30 and Rs 50. It is a very good initiative by the leader."""

As per chief minister Amarinder Singhs directions, the committee will include additional chief secretary (cooperation), additional chief secretary (development) and chairman of the Punjab State Farmers Commission (PSFC). The committee has been directed to submit its report by March 1.The committee would suggest ways and means to provide marketing support for maize and potato crops to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices without wastage of these commodities.The chief minister directed the committee to identify domestic and international markets for sale and supply of farmers produce at attractive prices as they have to suffer losses due to lack of proper marketing facilities for these crops. It has also been directed that the committee should also explore the possibility of future trading in these farm produce to facilitate farmers in ensuring remunerative pricing with risk hedging.The chief minister also reiterated that farmers should be encouraged to opt for crop diversification in a big way in line with the state governments thrust on diversified cultivation as a means of rescuing them from their debt cycles. He has also sought committees suggestions to spread awareness among potato growers about various varieties to help them cultivate the varieties that are in demand by large multi-national companies (MNCs) such as McDonalds and McCain Foods.The chief minister also asked the committee to assess the possibility production of ethanol from maize as suggested by the Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari."

Narayan, former Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister, said.Rice and wheat are standard items and the government has been procuring them over a long period of time. But the case of potato and tomato is different with so many variants. To standardise and give the correct price would be difficult, he pointed out.Mr. Narayan was speaking at a seminar titled Demystifying the Union Budget 2018, organised by The Womens Christian College in association with Finmark Trainers.Regular increaseHe pointed out that in the UPA regime between 2004 and 2014, there was regular increase in the minimum support price and farmers were better off.After 2014, the minimum support price was not increased. But, the cost has gone up and there are several instances of farmers distress. One shot increase in the minimum support price is a good sign, though it might be inflationary for the common man, Mr. Narayan said.The budget proposal to provide technology for horticulture was a great idea, but the government needed to spell out its plan clearly, he added."
60,From Plate To Plough: A vision colouredÂ green,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/union-budget-2018-operation-greens-allocation-arun-jaitley-indian-farmers-5069070/,2018-02-19,Indian Express,"The country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The finance minister announced Operation Greens, on the lines of Operation Flood, with a seed capital of Rs 500 crore in his speech on February 1. Three days later, the Prime Minister backed the scheme at a parivartan rally in Bengaluru. He said farmers are his TOP priority  T is for tomatoes, O for onions, and P for potatoes.Operation Flood changed the face of milk production in India, making the country the largest producer of milk in the world  in 2016-2017, the country produced 164 million metric tonnes (MMT). But its important to note that Operation Flood was driven largely by smallholders and the AMUL model has ensured that 75-80 per cent of the price paid by milk consumers goes to the farmers. Operation Greens wants to replicate that success story in fruit and vegetables, starting with tomatoes, onions and potatoes.The main objective of this project, according to the finance ministry, is to reduce price volatility in these commodities, thereby helping farmers augment incomes on a sustainable basis. It also aims to provide these vegetables to consumers at affordable prices. The litmus test of this scheme would be in containing the booms and busts in prices. It will need to avert situations where farmers have been forced to dump potatoes and tomatoes on roads. Also, checking the prices from going through the roof has compelled the government to ban exports. It has resorted to de-stocking and conducted income tax raids on traders  the raids on onion traders in September last year is a case in point.India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world with about 180 MMT. But China produces four times more vegetables than India. The accompanying graph shows a structural break in Indias vegetable production around 2003-2004. Although not as revolutionary as the Green Revolution in wheat, or the White Revolution in milk, yields of potatoes, onions and tomatoes  which constitute almost half of the countrys vegetable production  have shown a healthy growth. For example, between 2003-2004 and 2017-2018, potato production increased from 28 MMT to 49 MMT while onion yields went up from 6.3 MMT to 21 MMT and tomato production increased from 8.1 MMT to 22 MMT.However, the problem with these commodities is that their prices collapse when their production rises sharply. This is because the country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. As a result, farmers often end up receiving less than a fourth of what consumers pay in major cities. This must change. Operation Greens needs to ensure that farmers receive at least 60 per cent of what consumers pay. In the case of milk, the producers get more than 75 per cent of what consumers pay. The basic principles of Operation Flood would be useful to operationalise Operation Greens as well.What are these principles? First, link major consumption centres to major production centres with a minimal number of intermediaries. As Verghese Kurien wrote in his book, I too had a Dream, organising farmers and increasing production is an easier job. The real challenge is to find the right markets that can give them remunerative prices on a sustainable basis. So, one needs to map mega consuming centres and link their retail networks with the producing centres of each commodity. Farmers can be organised in farmer producer organisations (FPOs). NABARD and SFAC (Small farmers agribusiness consortium) together have about 3,000 FPOs, which could be the starting points for the aggregation of commodities, assaying, sorting, grading, and even packing with bar codes, reflecting their traceability.The Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act will have to be changed to allow direct buying from FPOs, and giving incentives to these organisations, private companies and NGOs to build back end infrastructure as was done in the case of milk. The announcement of tax concessions to FPOs for five years is a welcome step in that direction, if it encourages building such critical infrastructure.Second is the investment in logistics, starting with modern warehouses, that can minimise wastage. An example is of cold storage for onions, where wastage is reduced to less than 10 per cent, compared to the 25-30 per cent wastage in traditional storage facilities on farmers fields. Such storage facilities have to be cost effective. A potato cold storage in UP, for example, that buys power at almost Rs 10/kwh from SEBs, can become efficient by generating solar power at less than Rs 4/kwh. Large-scale investments in storage will require tweaking of the Essential Commodities Act.Third is linking the processing industry with organised retailing. On an average, about one-fourth of the produce must be processed. India is way behind on this curve compared to most Southeast Asian countries. Dehydrated onions, tomato puree and potato chips should become cheap, so that an average household can use them. Processing industry adds value and absorbs surpluses. Seen this way, the finance ministers announcement of increasing the allocation for the food processing industry by 100 per cent is a welcome step. The food processing ministry will have to coordinate with Operation Greens.By developing such forward and backward linkages, the government can ease large price fluctuations, raise farmers share in the price paid by the consumer and at the same time, ensure lower prices for the consumers  a win-win situation for all.However, Operation Greens would need a champion to implement this vision and strategy with honesty, another Kurien, for at least three to five years. A babu will not work. Can the government locate another Kurien?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The business community is not making any profits and the employees are out on the streets up in arms against the government. Unemployment is on the rise, with more than 50,000 people on contract jobs having lost their livelihood in the past three years. The law and order situation is deteriorating, with women not feeling safe even inside their homes, said Mr. Hooda.Our schemes for the welfare of the Dalits, including distribution of freehold plots and financial help to construct houses, were discontinued by the present government, said Mr. Hooda, adding that the government did not even keep its promise to give Rs. 9,000 monthly allowance to the unemployed.Recuperating from an ankle fracture that happened at a public meeting earlier this month, Mr. Hooda said the BJP rode to power making false promises to the people but the party now stands exposed.Lost faithThe people of Haryana have lost their faith in the State government, asserted Mr. Hooda.IrregularitiesTearing into Manohar Lal Khattar governments claims of corruption-free governance and slogan of Haryana Ek, Haryanvi Ek, Mr. Hooda said even the Supreme Court had pulled up Haryana government on irregularities in granting mining lease and a fraud was committed in procurement of pulses for Dal-Roti scheme initiated by his government.The BJP government has disturbed communal harmony in the State over the past three years and pushed it towards anarchy. The Prakash Singh committee had indicted the bureaucrats and the Chief Ministers Office for violence during the Jat reservation agitation but the report was brushed under the carpet. They did not learn from the episode and repeated the mistakes in Panchkula during the [Dera chief Gurmeet] Ram Rahim episode, he said.Farmer woesOn farmers agitations across the country, Mr. Hooda, who enjoys support among farming community in and around Haryana, said farmers today were unable to even recover input costs and were left with no choice but to protest.While input costs have increased several folds for farmers, they are not fetching even half of the price for their produce compared to what they were getting during Congress rule. There were not taxes on fertilisers and pesticides during our rule. Now the government has imposed 5% tax on fertilisers, 18% on pesticides and agricultural equipment, said Mr. Hooda.The United Progressive Alliance government had waived farm loans to the tune of Rs. 72,000 crore and had also waived loans worth several hundred crores in Haryana, he added.Rubbishing claims by the Narendra Modi government regarding doubling income of farmers by 2022 as a political gimmick, the former Chief Minister said the formula to calculate input cost must include all factors and farmers should get 50% profit on the input cost.The farmers were forced to sell potatoes for as low as 9 paisa per kg in Kurukshetra last year. Does doubling their income means they will get 18 paisa per kg in 2022? Mr. Hooda said.Denying speculation of floating a political party in the run-up to the elections, Mr. Hooda said he was a dedicated Congress worker. Refraining from making a direct comment on demands by his supporters to appoint him as the State party president, Mr. Hooda said there was urgent need to rebuild the party in the State with less than a year to go for the elections.There are no block and district Congress committees in Haryana. The party needs to be straightened at the ground level or it will have an adverse impact on its electoral prospects, said Mr. Hooda.The farmers were forced to sell potatoes for as low as 9 paisa per kg in Kurukshetra last year.

In Ranchi, tuber rates went up marginally from Rs 10 to Rs 12.""I have been buying potato at Rs 10 per kg for the past one year. Its price remained the same even when onion was selling at Rs 50/kg around four months ago. I was quite surprised by the sudden hike,"" said Subodh Chaudhury, a Tata Steel employee who stays at Bistupur.Sonari resident Rita Sharma said she was also taken aback by the hike. ""Every year, some factor or the other causes potato prices to go up gradually. This was for the first time that its rate jumped from Rs 10 to Rs 15 in a day,"" said Sharma.Shopkeepers are, however, selling the new variety at Rs 12/kg to Rs 13/kg since it's demand is much less compared to the old variety.While the hike has pinched the pockets of consumers, potato sellers justified the rise. Shopkeeper Awadhesh Kumar Shao said they had no option since the price of the item at the wholesale market had spiralled. ""Customers prefer the old variety of potatoes which was in short-supply. Sensing this, the wholesalers raised the price of a 50kg packet from Rs 300 to Rs 450. We had no option but to increase the rate,"" Shao, who runs a shop in Bistupur market, said.On an average, 10 truckloads of potatoes come to the steel city from Bengal every day. On Saturday, only five trucks came. On Sunday, only four truckloads of the tuber were unloaded at Krishi Utpad Bazar Samiti at Parsudih from where its sold to city retailers.Wholesaler Rajkumar Shah said prices have gone up because traders have started stocking the item in cold storages having bought it directly from farmers. ""The stock of the old variety in cold storages has finished and traders are now filling the cold storages with the new produce. They would soon release the fresh stocks and sell it at higher prices,"" said Shah. He hinted that prices would spiral further in coming months.In Ranchi, the wholesale rate of the new variety ( laal aaloo), which was priced between Rs 700 and Rs 850 per quintal on Friday, is now selling at Rs 800-Rs 1000. Similarly, the old variety (sada aaloo), which was priced between Rs 500 and Rs 600 per quintal, is now selling at Rs 700 to Rs 800.In the retail market, prices have gone up by Rs 2 for both the variants. ""I am selling the old variety at Rs 12 compared to Rs 10 last week. Lal aaloo, which was Rs 10, is now being sold at Rs 12 to Rs 13,"" said Vijay Kumar, a prominent seller at Harmu market."

It is believed such huge size potatoes are grown for the first time in the country. Usually, such huge potatoes are imported from other countries by those into production of wafers or potato chips.KVR Rao, principal scientist, in irrigation and drainage department along with his team was able to grow such a huge potato. Rao said, the experiment was successful and plastic munching technique was used. It helped in fast growth of microbes, which in turn triggered tubers size by at least three times. Rao said, By using plastic munching technique, we were able to grow such huge potato. In plastic munching, a special plastic sheet with silver and black colour is installed on the farm land. Then a hole is made in the plastic sheet under which seed is sown.The plastic munch method will help raise yield output manifold and prevent the crop from pest attack and diseases. The sheet will support crop during excess rain and lack of required rain. Rao claimed, Farming of potato is difficult in the state due to black soil, but through plastic munching we can grow it that too in bigger size. Rao said, I have been working for three years to increase size of potatoes. Last year, we did first successful trial. On Wednesday, after harvesting second trial, we were able to do our successful experiment. Farmers will have to invest around Rs 24,000 per hectare on plastic munching sheet. After installing this, fertilizer and labour expenses will be nil and production will be three times higher than conventional method, he said."

They have been instructed to set up centres for procurement agencies like UP Agro , PCF, HAFED and others. No middleman will be allowed to be a part of the procurement process. The centres will function till March 31.Last year, for the first time, the state government had announced a potato procurement policy to prevent a slump in prices wherein state agencies were to purchase one lakh metric tonnes of potatoes at a support price of Rs 487 per quintal.Now, government has doubled the target and raised minimum support price from Rs 4,870 per metric tonne to Rs 5,490 metric tonne. Government has also announced Rs 1,373 per tonne as transportation, packaging and loading and unloading subsidy.During the previous crop season, in Bareilly, potato was potato was cultivated across 3,100 hectares with a yield of 88,000 metric tonnes. According to sources in the horticulture department, this year, more farmers are likely to grow potato attracted with the facilities the government has extended to growers. In Bareilly division, UP Agro has been tasked to open procurement centres.District horticulture officer Pooja said Rohilkhand produced maximum potato in the state last year.

This is being implemented on request of the state government willing to share the loss with the central government on a 50-50 basis, the order says.In a missive sent to all district magistrates as well as director, horticulture and food processing department on March 01, UP Agriculture Production Commissioner Raj Pratap Singh has conveyed the state governments decision in this regard following a letter from the Centre, also dated March 01, specifying the norms, said a senior official requesting anonymity in view of the model code in place for Phulpur bypolls.HT is in possession of a copy of the order that comes with a detailed table of agency entrusted the task of opening purchase centres in districts and the set target for them.The letter adds that overhead charges would cover expenses like transport, loading, unloading, gunny bag and other packing material, Mandi tax, purchase tax and godown charges etc. The purchases would be through agencies like UP Agro, Uttar Pradesh Cooperative Federation Limited, Uttar Pradesh Consumer Cooperative Society, National Cooperative Consumers Federation of India Limited (NCCF), UP State Horticultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (HOFED) etc, the official added.As per the plan, Rs 2 crore each would be made available to the UP Agro, the PCF etc by the State Agricultural Produce Markets Board, UP, as an interest free loan for four months on their demands while the Uttar Pradesh Consumer Cooperative Society and NCCF would arrange for the money themselves, the letter adds.These agencies would open procurement or purchase centres in different districts in consultation with the respective DMs with their numbers and targets being fixed as per local needs and circumstances. The purchase of potatoes would be made between March 2 and March 31, which, however, could be increased with the permission of the central government.The order specifies that while one purchase centre should become functional in every district from March 1 itself, by March 6 at least one such purchase centre should start functioning in every tehsil of a district.The procurement agencies should furnish a daily progress report to horticulture and food processing department through e-mail while the DM would ensure that a team of senior officials undertakes surprise inspection of the purchase centres, the missive says.Uttar Pradesh is the largest potato producing state of the country accounting for about 35% of the countrys total output. As per some estimates, a whopping over 23 lakh farmers grow potatoes in the state. With very limited capacity to store the produce just 1,708 cold storagesevery harvest produces the challenge for the government to ensure proper returns to the farmers at a time when large number of its cold storages are already full with last seasons harvest.In only its second cabinet meeting in April 2017, for the first time ever, the Yogi government had decided to fix minimum support price for potato to give fillip to potato growers who had been forced to sell their produce on throwaway prices in the past.Last year, the government had decided to purchase 1 lakh metric tonnes of potatoes from farmers at Rs 4,870 per tonne to arrest the sharp fall in prices besides an extra Rs 1,217.60 per tonne or actual whichever is less for overhead expenses."

The model contract law, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, follows the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.Conceived in the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to sell to licenced middlemen only in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere.These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling. Over time, they have spawned layers of intermediaries, stretching the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large price spread, meaning fragmentation of profit share because of the presence of too many middlemen.Usually, farmers get the lowest share of profit. APMCs have also become hubs for cartels that rig the system to offer lower prices to farmers while driving up prices for consumers. India has about 6,800 such public-sector markets.The revised Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018, now set to be released to states, allows firms to sign advance contracts with farmers to grow a chosen crop or its specific variety with a buy-back assurance at an agreed price, giving cultivators a ready market without the oversight of the APMC system.A model law isnt presented in Parliament, but is instead sent to states for passage since the Centre cannot bring laws to regulate agriculture marketing, which falls in the states domain.To work around APMC markets, the budget for fiscal 2019 has also proposed to develop 22,000 new or existing private rural markets.The revised provisions of the model contract law state that businesses and farmers can enter into contracts for any crop, livestock breed or poultry of their choice. The earlier version, released for public scrutiny on January 23, restricted contract farming to only those crops that are allowed by states.The model law provides for dispute settlement at the level of the tehsil, or local administrative unit. It does away with an earlier provision that disputes could be taken for appeal to a decree court. Instead, the parties can escalate it to a three-member local authority, comprising an independent farmer, a corporate representative and a domain expert, all unrelated to the contracting parties. The law seeks to protect the farmers lands and their title. No business can build permanent structures on a farmers land or seize land. Registrations of contracts will be completely online, the model law says. The earlier version provided for physical contracts.Technological advancement with better agricultural practices makes contract farmers more technically and economically efficient, according to a 2016 post-doctoral study on contract farming in Punjab by Nivedita Sharma of the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University.In most cases of contract farming, the sponsor, or the contracting firm, also directly provides most inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as credit and technical skills to the farmers with whom it enters into a deal. This lowers the market risk for farmers.Several states did reform markets and gave direct marketing licences to various kinds of corporate buyers like Tata, Mahindra and Godrej, said R Ravikanth, an analyst with commodity trading firm Comtrade.We dont support contract farming because it is another form of exploitation. Why isnt there a provision that all produce will be contracted above minimum support prices? said Pema Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha.Most of these licences are not in use, Ravikanth added, because it is difficult to coordinate with a large number of small farmers. Current examples of contract farming include PepsiCo Inc. for tomato in Punjab, SABMiller Plc. for barley and McCain Foods Ltd for potato in Gujarat."

But we will ensure a loan-waiver scheme in 24 hours after the announcement of election results. An Indian Institute of Technology will be set up in the city even if the Centre declines to sanction one, he said.Stating that he had learnt the nous and art of administering the state from his father, former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda , Kumaraswamy added, I will ensure all-round development of the district.Kumaraswamy said that he was keenly aware of the plight of farmers in the district. Instead of cultivating potatoes for customers in Bengaluru, we should grow vegetables that can be sent abroad. We should look to earn Rs 150, with an investment of just Rs 100. The plan I have for the district is unique and special. JD(S) wants to win all the assembly constituencies in Hassan, he added.The former CM said that he would try to implement scientific agricultural practices used in Israel. I will get 200 scientists from Israel. If the party is voted to power, all senior citizens will be given a monthly pension of Rs 5,000, and pregnant women will be paid Rs 36,000. All government schools will be brought on a par with private schools. I will ensure free quality education for all, he said.Criticising CM Siddaramaiah , Kumaraswamy said, The Congress government is running the state on loans borrowed from various agencies. Liquor that costs Rs 15, is being sold for rs 70 or Rs 80. This is how state government is ruining families.Attacking demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), he said, They have caused a lot of heartburn even for industrialists. Vote JD(S) to power. I have a comprehensive plan for all sectors."
68,Tasty snacks tell a story of grit,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tasty-snacks-tell-a-story-of-grit/articleshow/63239616.cms,2018-03-10,The Times Of India,"TRICHY: For R Shagunthala , starting a roadside eatery fifteen years ago was more of a desperate attempt to fund her childrens education. But the delicious snacks the shop has been serving all these years have won a lot of admirers for the 55-year-old woman. The eatery which has many loyal customers is located on West Adaiyavalanjan Street in Srirangam.Ask one of her regular snackers what they love to pick first from the shop and the answer is likely to be Tirumaal vadai. That is one item which my customers never get tired of. Within minutes of preparing the vadais, they get sold out. Most of those who come to my eatery tell me that ours is the best vadai they have ever tasted, says Shagunthala proudly. The specialty vadai is made of black gram and pepper. Besides this sought-after snack, the eatery also has a dedicated following for mint and onion pakoda.Asked how she learnt to make Tirumaal vadai, she said, It kind of tastes like vadais that we get as prasad in temples. I just made my own version of it. According to her, at least 500 customers come to her eatery every day. This is the reason why I make sure I dont take leave and my shop is open throughout the year, she said.Open from 4.30 pm to 8.30 pm, the other snack varieties at Shagunthalas shop include medhu vadai, masala vadai, potato bonda, chilli bajji, plantain bajji apart from the sweets adhirasam and boli. While adhirasam and boli cost Rs 5 apiece, four pieces of the rest of the items are available at Rs 10.Shagunthala credited much of her eaterys success to her husband. Though I run it, my husband helps me a lot. Hes the one who prepares the dough for all the items. He never gets tired, she said. The Srirangam-resident said she was immensely satisfied with the fact that the prime reason to start the eatery had been fulfilled. I started it so that I could provide good education to my children. My son is now working abroad and my daughter is leading a happy married life. This is all I wanted, she said.When asked if she had any plans to expand her business, she said, No, not at all. Its tough to manage this place itself. If I get greedy, Ill ultimately be the sufferer in the end, she said."

LakshmiNarayananThe fall in prices of vegetables both in the uzhavar santhai and in the open markets during the current marriage season has come as a pleasant surprise for consumers.The district has 11 uzhavar santhai, and major vegetable markets in Thalaivasal, Vazhappadi, Attur, and Mecheri. The price of vegetables in wholesale markets, and uzhavar santhai are fixed based on the arrival of stock and the prevailing demand.The price of vegetables has been coming down in the last few weeks.Normally, the prices go up during marriage season, and other festival days.The price of small onion has fallen from Rs. 180 a kg in December last to about Rs. 24 in uzhavar santhai on Monday.The price of tomato stood at Rs. 7 a kg; brinjal about Rs. 14; ladys finger Rs. 24; potato Rs. 20; snake gourd Rs. 10; broad beans Rs. 14; cluster beans Rs. 20; bitter gourd Rs. 16; green chilli Rs. 16; Bellary onion Rs. 27; cabbage Rs. 12; carrot Rs. 30; and radish Rs. 6.The price of coconuts, however, has gone up.Many consumers said that low price of vegetables will help those belonging to the weaker sections of society while conducting marriages.The farmers at Suramangalam uzhavar santhai said that the district experienced widespread rainfall by the end of last year, following which farmers had raised vegetables in a larger area. There was a spurt in vegetable production in the villages due to the availability of adequate water. The bulk arrival of all sorts of vegetables in the markets has brought down their price.The bulk arrival is expected to continue for a few more weeks, they said."

Potato crop is also likely to remain down to stagnant this sowing season, horticulture departments senior official said.The official said, Heavy losses suffered by onion and tomato farmers in the past months has discouraged sowing.In June 2017, farmers staged protest in the entire state after onion prices slid to Rs 2 per kg. Tomato prices have also tumbled this season to Rs 5 per kg-Rs 8 per kg in the wholesale market on increased arrivals.Agriculture experts said, even the soil moisture remained less during the sowing period owing to less rains.Farmers shifted to chana as it gave better returns to farmers last season. Also chana requires less water making it the preferred choice of farmers when rains are not sufficient, said Kailash Agrawal , an agriculture expert.Chana and wheat are the leading winter sown crops of the region.Agriculture departments statistics stated that farmers have sown wheat on over 5.75 lakh hectare while chana was sown on 4.75 lakh hectare in Indore division.Horticulture department expects yield of potato to remain lower this season hitting output due to lower soil moisture.Mohan Pandey, a wholesaler of vegetables in Choithram market said, Prices of onions and tomatoes are unlikely to pick up from the current levels in near term as supplies from the old stocks and neighbouring states are sufficient to meet the demand."

But the euphoria wore thin rather quickly.A year into his second term at the helm of the border state, the erstwhile Patiala royal has been in a firefighting mode. The implementation of a raft of promises  debt waiver, unemployment allowance, free smart phones, hiked social pensions and what not  made in the election manifesto has become a daunting challenge for his fund-crunched government. A watered-down scheme for farm loan waiver has already led to dissatisfaction. As a number of states head for polls this year, his role becomes all the more significant as the Congress needs to showcase its performance in states where it is in power. And there arent many.In a wide-ranging interview with Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak and Senior Assistant Editor Navneet Sharma in Chandigarh, Amarinder acknowledged the tough challenges that he faces while exuding a sense of optimism on stabilizing the states ever-shakier finances. Excerpts:How do you look back at your first year?Its been a tough one because we took over a sinking ship. There was no money and the debt was overflowing. Salaries got delayed. The treasury only had bills. Recovering from a debt of Rs 2.08 lakh crore is not easy. Look at the interest on that.What is the way forward?We are raising revenue and cutting costs. In my last tenure (2002-07), there was surplus. After giving each MLA Rs 100 crore for their constituencies before the assembly elections in 2007, we left a surplus of Rs 1,600 crore in the state treasury.You were upbeat about GST. Has it helped?No, it hasnt to the extent we expected though there has been an increase in collection. That is because of the lacunae in implementation. The situation has been aggravated by delays in the release of the states share. I still maintain that the idea of GST, originally mooted by former prime minister Manmohan Singh, is sound. Its execution needs a relook.Do you feel burdened by expectations and promises that you made?We are trying to fulfil the promises. Today, I released Rs 160-odd crore for debt waiver to 30,000 farmers. We started with Mansa. We will give the waiver to 50,000 farmers in Gurdaspur next week. We have another problem. Farmers are passing on the debt. If someone has 40 acres, he will give two acres to his son and claim the debt in his name. Thats what SDMs are checking. This fraud cant go on. That is why we are going slow. We have Rs 4,000 crore for this.You are committed to farmers. Is debt waiver the solution?No, it is not. It is only assistance. The only solution is to raise income. We have been feeding the country for 50 years. Today, India hopes to grow at 7.4%. Our growth is 5.6%. Agriculture is not the solution. We make efforts to bring industry. We are now giving power at Rs 5 a unit. We have to change the cropping pattern. Ive been talking about diversification since 1985.People in the House are sadly only interested in getting their names published in newspapers, says Amarinder. (Sanjeev Sharma/HT)How come nothing has changed?These fellows (the Akalis) dont do it. The moment they come to power, they halt it. Cases are slapped. No officer has the courage to take it up. Last time, we had the farm-to-fork project with Reliance Group. It was stopped. They later went back to Mukesh (Ambani) to ask him to return but he refused.Is diversification possible without the Centres assistance or logistical support?The private sector has grown strong. When I met Mukesh recently, I talked to him to look at it again. He promised a second look. We hope to rope in others too. We are counting on private investment. There is no other way.Will you bite the bullet on free power?No, it is difficult. It will become a political crisis. The farmers have been suffering. Of 17 lakh farming families, 10.25 lakh are small farmers. There is already one suicide a day. If free power is cut, they will be in a worse situation. I am trying to do something else. There are 13.5 lakh tubewells. We have chosen 900 in six villages where we are installing meters to gauge consumption. The Akalis have started creating a ruckus. The object is not to save power, but water. We are heading for a crisis. If this continues, Punjab will become a desert. Sub-soil water has gone down to 1,200 feet in Sangrur, Patiala and Bathinda, where it used to be available at 80 feet.What do you make of Niti Aayogs plainspeak when they told Punjab to forget about food security?They werent so blunt. They talked about diversification. Weve been saying the same thing. I told them to support us. They asked for a proposal. They give support to wheat and paddy. I sought price support for potatoes and mustard seeds. There was nothing negative at that meeting. We had similar thoughts on diversification.You appealed to big farmers but not many came forward. Why shouldnt your party leaders show the way?Its just selfishness. Why cant farmers who have income coming from other sources give up power subsidy? What is their problem? Manpreet Singh Badal, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Sunil Jakhar have given it up.There has been a controversy over illegal mining and goonda tax. Has this dented your governments image?I admit these controversies have hurt the governments image to an extent. But we have tightened screws. I flew down to Nakodar on Wednesday and checked if there was any illegal mining there. There was not a single machine.Now, there are allegations being levelled against (minister) Charanjit Singh Channi.If an uncle or nephew is doing something, you cant blame the minister. I have only read the allegations in newspapers.Was Rana Gurjits resignation a setback?I dont think so. He chose to go on his own. I didnt ask him to. There are two aspects. If somebody sets up a company and there are some friends who invest 10% in it, this has been happening in the industry since long. But the thing that he should not have done was to take Rs 5 crore from the contractor because of his portfolio. I think he realised and sent in his resignation.You promised to bring a law on conflict of interest. What is holding it back?Nothing. But you have to appreciate that this is going to be the first of its kind, so naturally its taking us time to thrash out the details. All MLAs declare their assets on January 1, which is a step towards ensuring there is no misuse of position.The budget session starts on March 20. We have a double-barreled opposition. How do we ensure the smooth functioning of the House?People in the House are sadly only interested in getting their names published in newspapers. They shout and jump up and down. Their names are printed. (AAP leader Sukhpal) Khaira keeps talking and his picture appears daily in print.In one of your interviews with HT, you said you would like to groom your political successor.The final decision will be of the Congress leadership. I have one or two names in mind that I will share with the Congress president (Rahul Gandhi) when I meet him.How will you rate the performance of Manpreet Badal, Navjot Sidhu and Sunil Jakhar?Jakhar is a good president. He is liked. He is fair-minded. Manpreet is good too. He is serious and hardly ever talks. People think Navjot is vocal but he quietly does his homework. He knows all about his ministries. Channi also does his homework well.What about the cabinet expansion?The cabinet expansion was to be done around this time but the Congress president and I could not coordinate our meeting. He had to go abroad to see his grandmother. The moment the budget session is over I will go to Delhi for the discussion. I have 40 portfolios and cant sleep at night. I have to read all the files.The Theresa May government has said it will raise the issue of British national Jagtar Johal with PM Narendra Modi during his visit to London for the Commonwealth meeting. What do you have to say?This man is an outright gangster. Pakistan is using a clever ploy. The borders are sealed. Pakistan is looking at sympathisers, chaps in Germany or Canada. They watch their activities on social media. They pick them up and send them with money. They use them to supply weapons. No one in intelligence knows who these guys are initially. Johal was also a part of this gang. Now, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has him.The Congress is having its plenary session. What is your recipe for its revival?Look where we are in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh today. These are ups and downs. Those in the government today had just one seat at one point of time. I dont think we need to worry. We are an old party with an established base. We are winning Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Who knows what will happen in 2019? The trend is changing.The Modi government has been criticised for snubbing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. What is your view?That is for the (Narendra) Modi government to say. I cant be expected to comment on their behalf. In Punjab, Trudeau was accorded due welcome, as per protocol, and I personally had a useful meeting with him. The Canadian prime minister came out with a categorical assurance that no pro-Khalistani elements or sympathisers were being encouraged, in any way, by his government.You have maintained that the Congress needs to strengthen its regional leaders.There is no interference from Delhi. The Congress president has given me a free hand to function. When I have to induct any minister, I consult the leadership. The last time I made my cabinet, no one interfered.What is your equation with Modi?There are two aspects. As a politician, we are different parties. We have our own stands on issues. When (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee ji was were there, I had no trouble with the government. We got their full support. The same thing was done by Manmohan Singh. If you recall once in the assembly, Mrs (Rajinder Kaur) Bhattal told (Parkash Singh) Badal saab, If you have any problem with Delhi, tells us. He said, Bibi ji tussi dur hi raho, sannu twadi lod nahin hai, we are managing fine. Now also, whether it is Mr Modi, Gadkari, Jaitley, Uma Bharti or whoever I have met, I havent had any problem.Anything you expect from the Modi government?They have to function within the framework. Whatever we have gone for or asked them to expedite, they have helped. For instance, they went out of their way on CCL (cash credit limit).There have been rumblings of dissent from Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa and some others. What do you have to say?It is not fair on Partaps part to speak against his own government. This is a petty-minded approach. You belong to the Congress, you support your government. If you dont want to support your government, then what are you in the Congress for?He said the government is being run by bureaucrats and there is very little political input.He can say that because I have 40 departments. Does he know that I sit up till midnight or 2am reading files? I cleared 5,500 files and held 362 departmental meetings in a year.Can you tell us three things you would like to do in your second year?State finance is number one priority and then, of course, jobs, industry and agriculture. These job melas we are doing, hopefully we will finish the year with about three lakh jobs. The third thing is to keep peace. I am going to be tough on all gangster, drugs business. You can see the change already.Leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira and some Congress MLAs have been raising the accessibility issue.This is incorrect. There is no day I dont have MLAs sitting here with me. I had a meeting of all Congress MLAs for two days last week. I met all secretaries, too. We discussed issues related to their constituencies. Before that, I called MLAs of different districts once a month for lunch and discussion. Thats collectively. Privately, they come for something or the other.In one year, you will be facing Lok Sabha elections? Which party will be your main opponent in Punjab?There are three parties  the Congress, AAP and Akalis. The AAP is on the verge of collapse because there is no support left for them. The Akalis are trying to put their act together, but they wont gel. If we play our cards right, we will be fine. We have to focus on development. Last time, we didnt do it. In 2002, we won only three of the 13 seats. My understanding with (then finance secretary KR) Lakhanpal was that as finances were bad, dont take any finances for one or two years and after that whatever you want. We stuck to it. In that one year, we could not build a road. The backlash came in the parliamentary polls. This time, we are not doing that. I have just announced projects worth Rs 123 crore for Shahkot.Your party MLAs expect you to act against the previous Badal government, but you have refrained.Thats a primary sort of demand. I have told them there is a law in this land. I cant just catch hold and shove them behind bars. Give me facts and we will look into them. We are looking into their transport business. But they are clever. They have gone off to Himachal. We have to have facts. Im not going to do what they did to me. After 13 years, both cases against me are still in court. People dont seem to know that."
72,"Pune: Prices of tomatoes, onions goÂ down",https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/prices-of-tomatoes-onions-go-down-5101765/,2018-03-18,Indian Express,"Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. (Image used for representational purpose) Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. (Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also. Ghadhave added that inter-state trade has almost stopped with traders from north India absent from the market.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
73,Yogi Adityanath's One Year: Waiver Cheque Failed to Check Farmers' Woes,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-adityanath-s-one-year-waiver-cheque-failed-to-check-farmers-woes/story-MFH1cZ5l7L9p8HrCct1yqN.html,2018-03-19,Hindustan Times,"As the Yogi Adityanath government completes a year in office, questions are being asked if it has done enough so far to mitigate the sufferings of farmers, whose income levels are one of the lowest in the country, according to the national sample survey-2011-12.Some facts about UPs farmers as per different surveys Estimated number of agriculture households in Uttar Pradesh is 1.80 crore and 43.8% of them are indebted.UP is among the states where the proportion of farm households suffering from poverty is the highest with 23.2% farm households in the state living below poverty line against the 22.5% of the national average.UPs farmers earnings are more than their expenditures. The average total monthly income of farmers in UP in 2012 was Rs 4923 against their monthly expenditures of Rs 6230 leaving them with savings in minus Rs 1307. The farmers of Punjab earned Rs 18059 and spent Rs 13311 saving Rs 4748 per month.Average gross cropped area per agricultural household in UP was 0.57 against 2.17 hectare in Punjab and 1.68 hectare in Haryana.UPs total share in countrys food production is 17.45% which is highest.Asking such questions is only natural as the BJP had devoted the first full four pages of its election manifesto Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra  to agriculture and farmers.Farm loan waiver was among the major promises that the BJP made to farmers. The crop loan of all small and medium farmers will be waived, the manifesto said.But when it came to implementing the pledge after the party romped to a grand victory in 2017, the fund-starved new government diluted the important loan waiver promise by putting in many eligibility conditions for debt-ridden farmers to avail the scheme, those familiar with the matter said.For example, it fixed a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh that could be waived, that too against one loan account only.Initially, 70 lakh farmers were expected to benefit after the government made a budgetary allocation of Rs 36,000 crore but gradually the number came down to just half. Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi said the government had waived farm loan to the extent of Rs 20,596 crore, benefitting around 33 lakh farmers.The eligible farmers, who have been left out, had been asked to give an application by March 10. We have received applications from lakhs of farmers. We will sit in March end and take a call, he said.Even the implementation of the promise drew flak when it was found that many farmers received loan waiver cheques for as low as Re 1 or even less.Although the government countered the criticism by arguing that since the loans existing on March 31, 2016 were being waived, many farmers paid their loan before that period and a few rupees still continued to be showed as arrears with banks. These are the same arrears for which many farmers got the loan waiver cheques of very low amount, additional director, agriculture, Rajesh Gupta pointed out.Arguments notwithstanding, the opposition found an opportunity to mock at the loan waiver scheme. Shailendra Kumar Awasthi, a progressive farmer of Asmanpur village in Bahraich said, the scheme ended up earning more critics than admirers due to dilution and faulty implementation of the important pre-poll promise.The BJPs loan waiver promise was a big joke to farmers, UP Kisan Sabha leader Mukut Singh said. They promised to waive all the loans of small and medium farmers, but later limited the amount to Rs 1 lakh apart from putting many other ifs and buts, he added.The waiver, Singh claimed, was too inadequate and benefitted too small a number of farmers to make any difference.Contrary to the promise of providing affordable electricity to each field, power tariff for unmetered private tube wells owned by farmers was increased by 50% and by 77% for unmetered residential connections at one go a few months after the new government came to power.Unprecedented tariff hike with regard to tube wells and domestic connections in villages contrary to the promise of cheaper power is one of the major reasons for the simmering discontent among farmers, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Awadhesh Kumar Verma said.The work on some other farmer-related announcements is till to begin. They include interest-free crop loan to farmers, setting up of Mukhyamantri Krashi Sinchai Kosh and making cows and other milch animals available to landless farmers.Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi claimed that the government had done a lot of work for farmers, which he claimed had no parallel. Apart from waiving crop loans, we are distributing 10,000 subsidised solar irrigation pumps to farmers every year, providing soil health cards to farmers as a campaign, we did record purchase of wheat and paddy and fixed the minimum support price of potato for the first time and ensured smooth and adequate distribution of fertilizers and seeds, he said, enumerating some achievements.Critics must not forget we got the mandate for five years and we will implement each and every promise made to farmers in the days to come. Our government is committed to doubling farmers income by 2022, he stressed.The criticism, however, becomes important when it comes from an organisation like the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, an outfit of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS). The government is trying its best but benefits of the policies are not reaching the ground because of the bureaucracy that makes the schemes and rules too complex for a common farmer to avail benefits, said Ram Chela Ji, state organization secretary.Farmers, he said, were disappointed. The government must act fast, he advised.The results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye polls must come as a wake-up call to those in power, he cautioned."

The starch bags would be similarly priced as plastic bags available commercially.Food starch may have traditionally found uses in cooking preparations and starching clothes, but starch from potato and maize may soon find a new use: bio-degradable utility bags. City-based Science and Technology Park (STP), run under the aegis of the Department of Science and Technology, in possibly the first-of-its-kind attempt, is planning to come up with starch bags that can even dissolve in water. Since March 18, the state government has imposed a blanket ban on the use of plastics  polythene bags, plastic sheets, flags, flexes and banners, plastic and thermocol items like plates, cups, glasses, forks, bowls and spoons. Though milk pouches have been exempted for now, the government is mulling supplying milk in glass bottles instead.Polymer experts are of the view that starch and Polylactic Acid (PLA) materials can be suitable alternatives to plastic. However, PLA being expensive may find less buyers, they suggest. Speaking to The Indian Express, Rajendra Jagdale, STP Director-General, said, Being bio-degradable in nature, starch bags can be an alternative to plastic utility bags. These bags can take weight up to 30 kilograms without experiencing any stretching or the possibility of tearing apart unlike polythene bags.Jagdale said starch from all food were suitable for manufacturing these bags but added that his team was in talks with companies in Pune mainly for starch from potato and maize, both of which are sufficiently available in India. With this, we will also be able to address some issues of farmers, who can supply the starch, he said. Since these bags are water soluble, they can best be used to store or package dry products.Vitthal Kate, corporator from Pimple Saudagar in Pimpri-Chinchwad, welcomed the move and said it would lend greater urgency to stop the use of plastic utility items. Kate along with his team has managed to replace plastic bags with cloth bags in the area in the last three months. Its definitely a positive step by the state government. It will boost efforts towards replacing plastic bags, containers and other materials with environment-friendly ones, he said.He, however, has a word of caution. While a ban on plastic has been imposed, the challenge ahead lies in providing appropriate alternative materials that will perform the function as efficiently as plastic. Peoples participation will matter equally as plastic can be completely removed only through awareness about its harmful effects, he said.On the cost of starch bags, Jagdale said they would be similarly priced as plastic bags available commercially. Since starch is available in plenty, these bags will cost between Rs 120 and Rs 130 per kilogram, similar to that of commercial plastic materials, he said. STP is in talks with companies with which it plans to set up manufacturing units estimated to cost Rs 8 crore. Up to 70 tonnes of starch bags would be manufactured in each of these units.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
76,"Potato prices up by Rs 5/kg, likely to remain high",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/potato-prices-up-by-rs-5/kg-likely-to-remain-high/articleshow/63407488.cms,2018-03-22,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA/TARAKESWAR: The tuber in your daily diet costs Rs 5 more a kilogram than it was last year. Experts tracking the price movement of potatoes say the possibility of a slide in the rates seems thin. Instead, it is likely to stay high for at least the next five months because Bengal has optimal yield this year and it didnt turn out to be a bumper crop that often pulls down the price.Asurvey of the city markets  Gariahat market, Lake market and Maniktala market  on Wednesday shows the tuber prices vary between Rs 14 and Rs 16 a kg, depending on the variety, S1, Jyoti and Chandramukhi.But farmers have made a killing this time, the best in the last eight years, with farm prices at Tarakeswar going Rs 8-9 a kg on Monday, at least 2.5 times more than the Rs 3.30-Rs 3.60 a kg rate last year. Accordingly, the wholesale prices stood at Rs 500 for a packet for 50 kg, which comes down to Rs 10 a kg.The surge in potato prices has an economics and perhaps a dose of politics behind it. The untimely rain after the onset of winter took its toll on production, bringing the yield down to 100 lakh ton, 15 lakh ton less than 115 lakh ton last year. Moreover, 90% of the states aggregate storage capacity was full by Monday. Traders collected potato packets from farms early.According to the agriculture department, the state consumes 5 lakh ton potato a month, the annual consumption being 60 lakh ton. Of the 100 lakh ton yield, about 63 lakh ton have already reached the 453 cold storages in the state, leaving about 20 lakh ton in farms. A chunk of these potatoes may go outside Bengal to UP and Punjab The other part is political. With the panchayat polls being round the corner, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is keen to see farmers get a good price. She is keeping a tab on the potato prices and farm prices. But a cold storage owner doesnt see the surge in potato prices as a reflection of demand and supply. Farm price for potato  Rs 500 for a 50kg packet  is arbitrary. It was fixed without going into the economics. The Trinamoolrun panchayats spread the rates ahead of the polls. The farm price and consequent wholesale and retail prices need correction. The government committee doesnt seem interested, a cold storage owner said.Refuting the charge, Pradip Majumdar , agriculture adviser to CM, cited at least three factors behind the surge: The production is optimal this year. There is a slump in supply from Punjab and UP that added to the overproduction problem last year. Traders took the initiative to buy potatoes they couldnt in 2017 after demonetisation."
77,"10% drop in farm suicides, 11,000 cases in 2016: Govt",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/10-drop-in-farm-suicides-11000-cases-in-2016-govt/articleshow/63405637.cms,2018-03-22,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Farmer suicides declined by nearly 10% in 2016 as compared to a year earlier, though the rate at which farmers took their lives continued to be at least one every hour. Maharashtra continues to be at the top in recording the highest number of farmer suicides in India.Provisional figures for the year 2016, disclosed by agriculture ministry in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, show that the country recorded 11,370 farmers (farm labourers and cultivators) suicides as compared to 12,602 in 2015.The decline may be attributed to better rainfall in 2016 which witnessed record production of kharif (summer sown) crops. In contrast, 2015 was the second consecutive drought year after 2014. A shortfall of 10% or more of rainfall for the entire monsoon season - June to September - is considered a drought year.The figures, however, show that the benefit of record production could not probably lessen the distress of farm labourers as suicides among them increased from 4,595 in 2015 to 5,019 in 2016. The overall decline was seen due to decline in the number of suicides among cultivators - from 8,007 in 2015 to 6,351 in 2016.The other states at the top in terms of having the dubious distinction of recording higher number of farmers suicides include Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana. In fact, two states - Maharashtra (3,661) and Karnataka (2,079) - together account for more than 50% of the total farmers suicides in 2016.These are provisional figures, shared by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) with the agriculture ministry. The bureau has, so far, not made the final figures public.Farm activists took the figures for 2016 with a pinch of salt. Decline in number of farmers suicides can mainly be attributed to data manipulation and change in category (from farm related suicides to non-farm suicides). Getting the NCRB to abstain from releasing its report raised strong suspicion, said Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture ( ASHA ).Out of 3,661 farmers suicides in Maharashtra, 2,550 were cultivators while remaining 1,111 were farm labourers. Similarly, in Karnataka, 1,212 cultivators and 867 farm labourers took their lives in the state.Flagging figures of West Bengal which reported zero suicide in 2016, Kuruganti told TOI that those who worked on the ground had reported suicides of potato farmers in the state but the ministry figures show it as nil. Where have those numbers gone? she asked.Though the ministry has not specified causes behind suicides in 2016, the minister of state for agriculture Parshottam Rupala, in his written response, said the bankruptcy or indebtedness and farming related issues were reported as major causes of suicides among farmers/cultivators in 2015. Citing the NCRB report of 2015, he noted that family problems followed by illness were reported as major causes of suicides among agricultural labourers.Kuruganti said, Even 11,370 farmers suicides in a single year, as disclosed by the ministry as the NCRBs provisional figure, is quite a big number. It clearly shows that neither the Centre nor the states are serious about dealing with the farm distress."
78,"Plastic Ban in Maharashtra: If Found Guilty, Traders and Shopkeepers May Lose Permits",https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/plastic-ban-in-maharashtra-if-found-guilty-traders-and-shopkeepers-may-lose-permits/story-wUrwiaL8R0M6IqSHxTADOM.html,2018-03-25,Hindustan Times,"A day after the state government issued a notification barring use of plastic, it has announced that retailers and shopkeepers may lose their licence if found guilty.During licence renewal, shopkeepers will have to give an undertaking in the form of affidavits that they wont use, sell and stock plastic. Meanwhile, retailers in the city demanded that bags and packages used to maintain the quality and freshness of cereals, pulses, fruits and breads not be banned as they are used as protective material.Environment minister Ramdas Kadam said apart from the government traders and shopkeepers will also have a key responsibility in implementation.We have given adequate time of three months to traders, manufacturers and stockists for the existing stock by issuing a notification in January, he said.Facing uproar from manufacturers, the state government may extend the deadline for plastic disposal. Civic authorities will certify if a manufacturer has disposed of the stock within a stipulated time. Though they are expected to dispose it in a month, additional time will be given after deliberation by the high power committee and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, said Kadam.The government has clarified that according to the rules stakeholders have to set up a mechanism to recycle water bottles and milk bags.Manufacturing associations have slammed the government for allowing plastic containers of potato chips and tetrapacks for eatables manufactured by multinational companies. Multi-layered plastic packs used to package potato chips is not banned. Similarly, bags for pulses and cereals have been excluded from the ban. This is discriminatory and harmful to small businesses, said Ravi Jasnani, president of Maharashtra Plastic Manufacturers Association.The Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association (FRTWA), while welcoming the ban, has demanded to exclude bags that are integral part of packaging from the ban. Federations president Viren Shah, in a letter to the chief minister, said, Bags used to maintain the quality and freshness of cereals, pulses, fruits, breads should not be banned as they are used to protect the material.Ramdas Kadam said primary packaging has not been banned. The fear of rise in unemployment or loss of business was blown out of proportion as 80% of the plastic consumed in Maharashtra is manufactured in other states, he said. Three months ago, we had given a notice to these manufacturers to switch to other business and dispose of their stock, he said.Your home delivery food may cost moreThe plastic ban may reduce environmental destruction and clogging of drains, but your bill for home-delivered food is likely to rise.The government notification on Friday, which has banned one-time use plastic containers, has put home delivery businesses in a soup.Most restaurants that deliver food use banned disposable plastic containers. Restauranters admitted that this is the easiest and safest way to carry food, especially liquid items such as curries and soups.These containers are available in the wholesale market at Rs5 a dozen or more based on the quality.With the ban in force, restaurant owners are scrambling to find alternatives, which, they said, may not be cost effective.Santosh Shetty, president of Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR), said, As the notification was issued just a day ago, we have not got enough time to think about items that can replace plastic containers. Alternative items will be more costly, so we will have to charge for packaging.According to restauranters, the current cost of packaging is between Rs2 and Rs10 per delivery. A restauranter from Fort said, I charge my customers Re1 per container. Each dish is priced between Rs50 and Rs150. I fear I will lose business if I begin to charge customers more money for delivery. For most restaurants, free home delivery is one of their unique selling points.Dilip Datwani, president of Hotel & Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said, We can use tin foil for most deliveries or paper bags for dry items. The problem will occur with soups. We may have to stop delivering soups and juice altogether, or come up with a viable option.Nafisa Jr, chief marketing officer of The Bohri Kitchen, said, We are yet to find an alternative that is cost effective. After we study cost implications of alternatives, we will decide whether to pass on the burden to customers or not.Restaurant owners associations have decided to try other options for a month. Shetty said, If it is not cost effective, we will approach the state and ask it to relax norms."
79,'Ideologies against the BJP should unify as an anti-communal force',https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/ideologies-against-the-bjp-should-unify-as-an-anti-communal-force-218139?ref=india-new-stry,2018-03-25,Telegraph,"Sonia SarkarThere is no forgetting the image of the resolute foot. Calloused. Caked with earth and awash with blood. The skin torn in one place, flesh exposed - raw and red, screaming. It was one among 50,000, probably many more, pairs that covered 180 kilometres from Nashik to Mumbai for rights - the rights of the farmers of Maharashtra.The march that culminated a fortnight ago ended with the BJP-led government in Maharashtra acceding to the key demands of farmers. The man behind this massive long march, however, remains steadfast in his refusal to take any credit for it. ""I was just present in solidarity with them. Leaders such as Ashok Dhawale, J.P. Gavit, Kishan Gujar and Ajit Nawale made this happen,"" says 44-year-old Vijoo Krishnan, joint secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), the largest Left-affiliated farmers' organisation with 1.6 crore members across India.It has been difficult to catch Vijoo who is based in Delhi but has been on the move continuously. ""The biggest thing is, it was the march of the farmers for their survival,"" he says, as he leans back in the white plastic chair in his office in central Delhi. His words are forceful, without being aggressive. The pleasant smile never quite leaves his face.You would not be blamed for thinking this mass protest was really easy to pull off, except that it was not. This long march didn't become historic overnight. It was the result of a concerted effort of the AIKS for many months to organise farmers against the neo-liberal economic policies of the state and the Centre. ""Our leaders have been preparing people to walk in this heat for months. Collecting grain, firewood and essentials for making this a success,"" says Vijoo, who is also a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).He tells us how one of the comrades put out on social media a 40-second video of the rally, which caught the imagination of urban Indians. ""Many social media enthusiasts, even those not belonging to our party, shared the video. Some even asked us for images which they shared on Twitter and Facebook - this forced mainstream media to cover it.""Vijoo's engagement with farmers' woes is no one-off. For the last one decade, he has been proactive in raising agrarian issues related to minimum support price for crops, waiver of loans, land rights and land acquisition. And since the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014, he has been more busy than usual.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise to bring 'acchhe din' or good times for farmers during the 2014 general elections campaign has fallen flat. He had promised cheaper loans, pension and insurance for farmers, fair and remunerative prices for crops as stated by the National Commission on Farmers but nothing happened. Instead, there has been a drastic cut in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Yojna, public investment in agriculture has been reduced, and cattle farmers have been lynched in the name of cow protection,"" he says.Speaking of lynching, didn't the AIKS recently organise a two-day meeting under the umbrella of Bhumi Adhikar Andolan, a conglomerate of 300 grassroots organisations, to address the issue? He nods. ""Attacks by cow vigilantes are not just attacks on minorities and Dalits but also attacks on agriculture and the economy of the farmers.""Has the AIKS been able to garner support of the farmers of Bengal who moved away from the Left parties following the Singur and Nandigram land acquisition controversies? ""Attacks on cadres by the Trinamool Congress workers have led to a considerable fall in our membership,"" says Vijoo.The AIKS apparently had one crore members across Bengal until 2011 but the numbers dropped to 60 lakh in 2013. ""It has gone up to 80 lakh now,"" he points out. According to him, the farmers of Bengal are in distress under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee. His Bengal-based colleague, Amal Haldar, also told The Telegraph that reeling under huge debt since 2011, 208 potato and paddy farmers across the state have committed suicide.Vijoo continues, ""Plus, the minimum support price announced by the central government is Rs 1,550 per quintal for paddy. In Bengal, the farmers get around Rs 800-1,200 per quintal because there is no government procurement. The traders procure it, so they eat up the money.""In one corner of Vijoo's spartan office room is a red martyr's column - meant to commemorate comrades who have died. It is a mobile structure and scribbled on it is the red salute - "" Amar Shaheedon ko Lal Salam"". It brings to mind the recent bloodbath between the Left and RSS workers in Kerala. According to one estimate, 85 CPI(M) workers and 65 RSS workers have been killed between 2007 and 2017. ""RSS has opened shakhas even in Kannur, where the Left has the strongest base. But they have not been able to gain prominence,"" says Vijoo, who originally belongs to Karivellur village in Kerala's Kannur district.He talks about the RSS' violence in Tripura, how its workers have been torching CPI(M) offices there. ""They started by demolishing Lenin's statue, then they demolished statues of B.R. Ambedkar and the Dravidian icon Periyar - their intolerance makes them want all those ideologies opposing theirs to perish.""But he doesn't believe the Left is going to perish anytime soon? The success of the recent farmers' rally in Maharashtra - wherein the state government agreed to waive their loans, stop forceful acquisition of farm lands and compensate farmers hit by natural calamity - is proof for Vijoo that it isn't. ""These struggles ensure that an atmosphere is created for the defeat of communal forces. We may have had electoral reverses but nobody can write off the Left just yet.""But given the recent electoral performance of the Left, it doesn't look like it can defeat ""communal forces"" by itself. Then again, the top CPI(M) leadership has refused to establish an alliance with BJP's biggest opposition, Congress. Since the Left withdrew support for the Congress-led UPA-I government in 2008 over the Indo-US nuclear deal, the two haven't seen eye to eye. ""We have to channelise all energies to defeat the BJP in all seats, whether we are directly in the contest or not. We need not have an alliance or understanding with the Congress,"" he says. Then adds, ""Yet our position against the BJP as the main enemy may indirectly benefit the Congress.""Vijoo stresses that the Congress should be clear about its strategy, especially on the recent violence by the Sangh and affiliated forces. A fact-finding report - titled ""Divide and Rule in the Name of Cow"", brought out by Bhumi Adhikar Andolan this month - criticises the Congress for not taking a stand on lynching.What does he make of Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his temple run? Does he think Congress is adopting a soft-Hindutva approach? ""That also is there,"" Vijoo says. ""This is a hypocritical position - they have to give it up.""And the Left's own niggling issues - how does he see the Prakash Karat vs Sitaram Yechury fight resolve itself? ""It is media hype,"" he says. ""Ours is a democratic party. For us, there could be different opinions but we go by what the party congress decides.""At this point, a buzzing wasp enters the scene making Vijoo nostalgic. He recalls how a wasp stung him during his JNU days. Those days he was campaigning for the Delhi University Students' Union elections. ""I couldn't recognise myself in the mirror for many days,"" laughs the former JNU students' union president, thus taking the sting out of an otherwise intense discussion.We get chatting about his student days, JNU then, JNU now. The conversation turns to the current crop of student leaders from the institution - Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, Shehla Rashid. Vijoo says that individual leaders get a lot of attention these days. ""In our times, it was always the organisation that got precedence."" Could it be that this seminal philosophy defines his characteristic reticence, the reluctance he expressed earlier on at being credited with the success of the farmers' rally? Perhaps.We are still on JNU. And he says after a minute's thought, ""There should be better linkages between the similar ideologies that have cropped up."" If you ask him, even beyond the campus, the band of young leaders - Jignesh Mevani, Chandrashekhar Azad and Akhil Gogoi - should come together. He says, ""They should be part of the issue-based unity against the communal BJP. They should organise into a new, unified force.""As I get up to leave, I spot a poster with the visual of a blood-soaked trident and the nib of a fountain pen. The message scrawled on it reads: ""Choose which side you are on"". That's for us, not him. His choices couldn't be clearer."
80,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,The Hindu,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy. Who would like being rewarded peanuts, after being highly productive?"

The stink is unbearable. People walk over vegetable waste strewn along the pathway at the market causing an unpleasant experience for shoppers, said Shankar.The piling up of trash has been a longstanding woe for visitors to the market comprising about 2,750 shops selling flower, fruits and vegetables, generating nearly 200 tonnes of garbage daily. Though an area has been earmarked behind every shop for disposing of waste, traders prefer to leave it on the pathways. Rotten vegetables are dumped on the premises, which attracts cattle in the locality.S Chandran, president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association admitted traders were yet to practise proper disposal of waste but also raised concerns about clearing of garbage. We have asked traders not to spill trash on the pathways. The traders say garbage collection does not happen from the space earmarked for the purpose, he said. The Market Management Committee (MMC), comprising officials from the CMDA and representatives of traders, maintains that garbage clearance is being conducted by a private agency.V R Soundararajan, former member of MMC and president of Koyembedu Potato Wholesale Merchants Association, said the CMDA must allow the corporation to take over the responsibility of maintaining the facility. Of late, garbage is being cleared twice a day at flower, fruit and vegetable markets, said an MMC official, adding that steps are being taken to prevent cattle from entering the market"

We want voluntary co-operation from people in this mission,"" said horticulture secretary Bhutia. He added that unsold non-organic vegetables brought till Saturday will be seized.""The ban should be total. If it is selective, we will also get vegetables from outside. When people cannot differentiate between organic and inorganic vegetables in the market, how can the department seize our stock? This is a worry for us,"" said a vendor at Lall Bazaar, the main vegetable market in Gangtok."

Picture by Manob ChowdharyRanchi: If you thought vegetable prices had already hit the roof - on Thursday potatoes were selling at anything between Rs 16 a kg and onions at Rs 20 a kg - then brace for a further shock likely to be the result of a hike in freight rates since transporters are reeling under the impact of frequent fuel price hikes.According to Ranchi Goods Transports Association's spokesperson Sunil Chauhan, the going rate for a small truck carrying goods on the Ranchi-Jamshedpur highway used to be anything between Rs 2,800 and Rs 3,000 a couple of months back.""Now no truck operator is willing to load his vehicle for anything less than Rs 3,500,"" he said. ""For a Ranchi-Hazaribagh trip the rate used to be between Rs 2,500 and Rs 2,600. Now, it is between Rs 3,000 and Rs 3,200 per trip for a small truck.According to Chauhan, who is also chairman of the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) transport sub-committee, the transport sector was in chaos because of an environment of uncertainty. ""A year back, I took a tender for supplying LG products in Ranchi and adjoining districts at the rate of Rs 58 per km. Today, diesel costs more than Rs 65 a litre. How do I adjust my losses?"" he said.Agreed Lalit Narayn Ojha, the president of Jharkhand Truck Owner's Association.

These are arbitrary hikes, but we are helpless. Ultimately, the price of goods of daily use gets increased,"" he said.Krishna Mohan Singh, president of Ranchi Bus Owners Association, admitted they were thinking of a fare hike, but revealed that they would do so after the civic polls. ""We have submitted a proposal for a 20 per cent hike across all routes to the state transport department,"" Singh, who is contesting as a councillor from ward 39, said.Vegetable vendors across the city are already talking of a price increase.""

The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh are owed over Rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (SAP). Maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of Rs 2,213 crore as on March 31, that too, against the Centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Yet, cane area in Maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from October is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of UP farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. One reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. The fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from October to April further adds to the attractiveness.But the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. We are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. These are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) through government procurement. Sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the FRP/SAP, though the monies may come with a few months delay. Theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. Bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. Oilseeds and pulses have been trading below MSPs over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. Farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: Tomatoes in Kolar (Karnataka), onions in Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) and potatoes in Agra (UP) are currently selling or were just sold at Rs 6-7 per kg.Given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in Madhya Pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in Marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in Punjab. This is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. The policy prescription to address it is simple: The Centre and state governments should desist from hiking MSPs/FRPs/SAPs of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. Instead, farmers should be ensured of getting MSPs and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Subsequently, we identified a godown where the goods were stored and kept a vigil, he said.Soon after the truck laden with the syrup bottles came out, the narcotics team stopped and searched it, the ADG added.The printed price on the syrup bottles led to an estimate that consignment was valued at Rs 61.44 lakh. But each syrup bottle is sold at Rs 300 in black market, thus escalating its value to Rs 1.92 crore, Kapoor said.The narcotics police also found 145 sacks of onions and seven sacks of potatoes in the truck.Truck driver Mohanlal Pathak, 54, a resident of Ravidas Nagar, was booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.The driver told the interrogators that the he was paid a meagre sum to transport the consignment to Siliguri in West Bengal.We are in the process of ascertaining modus operandi of smugglers. Prima facie, it appears that the branded syrup was procured at godown through legal channels from Himachal Pradesh based manufacturing company. But they were being pushed into the back channels, Kapoor said.The cough syrup, which is often misused by addicts to get high due to the codeine content, is believed to be supplied by the dummy firms in the state through back-channels to Kolkata and Bangladesh , where the demand is high.In September 2017, Madhya Pradesh's drug controller's office had suspended licences of eight pharmaceutical wholesalers of Ujjain for a brief period, after a probe revealed that over six lakh bottles of codeine based cough syrups were sold by them to a dummy firm in Bhopal.According to United Nations Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC), codeine is a narcotic drug and causes addiction when used in large quantities over a period of time. Cough preparation containing chlorpheniramine maleate, an anti-histaminic, in addition to codeine phosphate, have been widely abused in certain areas of east and north-eastern states.Empty bottles of codeine phosphate cough syrups of different brands are often found in public and touristy places, a UNODC report said."

But traders say that in a months time, vegetables may turn dearer.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra recorded a good yield of vegetables due to copious rainfall last year, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The produce was harvested simultaneously. Due to the good yield, the prices of many vegetables continue to be low. However, it may begin to increase soon. There may be no new yield due to summer and water shortage. The rising heat level will play a role in price rise. The quality of produce will also be affected, he said. As on Tuesday, a kg of onions from Andhra Pradesh was priced at Rs. 10 to Rs. 12, while onions supplied from Maharashtra were priced at Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 depending on size, variety and quality, he added.Tomatoes were priced at Rs. 8 per kg. In fact, last week, the price ranged from Rs. 5 to 10, he pointed out. Potatoes cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 22, while small onions were priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 25.The rates of a few vegetables have been on the rise. The cost of beans has increased from Rs. 10-Rs. 15 nearly 15 days ago to Rs. 40 now. Beans and cauliflower are easily perishable during summer. Cauliflower is priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 a piece, he added. Another vegetable that has turned costlier is the local thorny brinjal. Last week, a kg was priced in the range of Rs. 10 to 12. In the last two to three days, the rate has been on the rise and today a kg costs Rs. 40, he added.The prices of other vegetables (per kg) are  carrot Rs. 15, ladys finger Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, drumstick Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, snake gourd Rs. 15, bitter gourd Rs. 25, radish Rs. 10 to Rs. 15, green chillies Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, ginger Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 and coriander Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, according to Mr. Balu."

However, the cold stores are yet to become popular among horticulture farmers.Absence of cold storage facilities had been a major headache for horticulture farmers of the district not long back. The private cold storage of 1,500 tonnes capacity at Rourkela was the last option for farmers two years back as the other two Government-owned stores in Kuanrmunda and Lahunipara blocks had been closed.Sundargarh Deputy Director of Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu informed that a cold storage of 5,000 tonnes has become functional in Bargaon block from 2016-end while another private store, having the same capacity, started operation from April last year in Bonai block.The Governments estimated cost for a cold storage of 5,000 tonnes is about `4 crore. Each of the private store promoters has been given a subsidy of `2.80 crore along with heavy incentives on energy bills for a period of six years, Sahu said.Another private cold storage of 5,000 tonnes capacity is also coming up at Sankara near Sundargarh town with support from National Horticulture Board of the Central Government, he said and added that farmers are being charged `160 to `170 per quintal for a season from March to November.Besides, a cold store of 10 tonnes has already been completed at Rajgangpur while two pre-cooling chambers of combined capacities of 16 tonnes are under construction at Sadar and Hemir blocks. These facilities would be beneficial to preserve thin skin vegetables for a short period of 15 days. Similarly, thick skin vegetables can be preserved for 45 days in the chambers, Sahu informed.However, farmers are not fully aware of the new cold storage facilities and are being informed to use them, Sahu added.Incidentally, the two cooling chambers with combined capacity of 45 tonnes, which were constructed in Nuagaon block four years back, are yet to be made functional. Similarly, a 10-tonne capacity chamber in Bisra block meant for BPL farmers is yet to operate. Sahu said initially, power supply issue was the reason for the delay in operation and now, there are management problems among local villagers.Administrative sources said that the upcoming Wholesale Market Yard project of Regulated Market Committee, with an estimated cost of about `98.5 crore, would also have a mega cold storage facility which would benefit horticulture farmers of the entire Panposh sub-division, including leading horticulture producers of Nuagaon block.Bonai Assistant Director of Horticulture Sanjeev Mahanta said with availability of cold storage facilities, farmers of the potato cultivation belt of Ruguda, Jangla, Badgogua, Kello, Kuliposh, Kariadihi and other pockets would be encouraged to revive cultivation of tuber crop."

There was a time when street food vendors of Old Delhi were an anonymous lot. Only the die-hard street food lover knew about, say, Moinuddins kababs or Jain Saabs fruit sandwiches. The adventurous would venture out in search of them, but the nondescript vendors sat in little corners, and it wasnt easy to locate them. And then came Anubhav Sapra.A street food lover himself, Sapra has been organising food festivals and food walks. He leads groups of people through the mazes of Old Delhi and introduces them to the best of street food.And now, with his group, Delhi Food Walks, he has started a process of giving the best recognition as well. I was present at the first edition of the Delhi Street Food Awards, 2018, held in the Capital recently. It was a nostalgic reunion of food lovers and sellers.Delhi Food Walks had selected 19 food categories  and put them up online for a vote. And I must say I agreed with most of the decisions.Natraj Chaat in Chandni Chowk is actually known for its dahi bhalley, but got the best award for its aloo tikki. And indeed, the tikkis are delicious  with a crispy outer layer and soft and spicy potatoes within. My old favourite  Ashok Chaat Bhandar in Chawri Baazaar  won the award for gol gappas. I am not much into gol gappas mself, but I certainly rate them as one of the best chaat makers in town.Best samosasWhen it comes to samosas, it is difficult to zero in on any one samosa shop. But the well stuffed samosas of Chaina Ram Sweets are certainly among the best. The prize for the best papdi chaat went to Shri Balaji Chaat Corner in Chandni Chowk.I love bedmi poori and Shyam Sweets in Chawri Bazaar, which won the award, is one of my favourites. And if you like chholey bhaturey (like I do, and I believe as do certain sections of the Indian political class!) then you should certainly try out the fare at Chachas in Kamla Nagar.For breakfast fare, there is nothing quite like the nagori halwa that you get at Shiv Mishthan Bhandar in Chandni Chowk. But on kulfi, I differ with the majority that voted for Roshan Di Kulfi in Karol Bagh. My favourite is Kuremal Mohanlal in Kucha Pati Ram.I was happy to meet some of the Qureshi brothers, who grill the most delicious seekh kababs in the Jama Masjid area and won the best seekh kabab prize. Khandani Pakode Wala in Nauroji Nagar was awarded for their delicious pakoras prepared with cauliflower, brinjal, paneer, potatoes and so on.Among the other winners  all old favourites  was Fateh Ki Kachori in Civil Lines, Lotan Kulche Waala in Chawri Baazaar and Kallu Nihaari in Turkman Gate.Other winnersThere were other awards as well  the best banta recognition went to Vedprakash Lemon in Chandni Chowk, Dolma Aunty in Lajpat Nagar was voted for her juicy momos, Moolchand Paranthe Waala for its popular parathas, Jain Chawal Wala in CP for rajma chawal and Singing Tree in Chittaranjan Park awarded for the various kinds of teas it serves. There was even a prize for the best paan, which went to Gupta Paan, better known as Odeon Paan.The much respected Jamaluddin got a Hall of Fame award for his Old Kheer Shop in Lal Kuan area, while special category awards were conferred on ILHAM Afghan Cuisine Rajiv Bhai Ke Special Pizza Omelette in Palam Extension. The Trending Street Food honour went to KB Chaats Moonglet, Karol Bagh.All well deserved, I say. But now its time we gave the best award giver award to Delhi Food Walks!"

There was 0.88% inflation in food items in February.Only onion and potato in vegetable segment witnessed inflation of 42.22% and 43.25%, respectively. Manufactured products inflation was at 3.03% even as sugar prices fell 10.48% during the month. The price rise in the fuel and power basket was at 4.70% in March from 3.81% in January due to rising crude prices.India Inc hailed the ease of inflation and the governments supply-side response.Consistent decline in WPI indicates that the government has undertaken effective measures at the ground to address the supply side problems of the economy during the last few years. A significant decline in the inflation of food articles including cereals and pulses is an indicator that the government has rightly focused on the agriculture sector, said PHD Chamber of Commerce.Earlier, the data showed retail inflation too slipped to a five-month low of 4.28% in March on account of decline in food prices providing comfort to the RBI for its next monetary policy review."

Now prices have gone up and I expect good profit on my produce. Last year farmers had to pay from their pockets to sell potatoes.Like Banglewala, several potato farmers have heaved a sigh of relief after potato prices touched Rs 20 per kg in the market after trading as low as Rs 3 to Rs 4 per kg.Market experts said lower production and less availability of potatoes this season help in lifting prices. Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Dhar and Shajapur are the main potato growing belt in the region.As per data from MP Cold Chain Industries Association, about 10 lakh MT of potatoes are stored at cold storages in Malwa region as against the capacity of 12 lakh MT.Association president Hansmukh Jain Gandhi said, Potatoes contributes about 60 to 70 per cent of storage volume of the cold storages. A lot of capacity was left unutilized this season because potato crop was less.Potato production was down by over 20 per cent last season due to poor prices.Gandhi said, Farmers will earn good profit on potatoes this year because prices have gone up and supply is less. Farmers will gradually take out their supply from cold storages now as they will wait for further hike in prices.Market experts expect potato prices to touch Rs 25 per kg in a month."

The unsold produce soon turned into heaps of rotten slush.Singh says he sold 40 quintals for Rs 2,306 to a local trader, meaning he got Rs 57.65 a quintal. It was the worst year as long as I can remember, he says.The potato crisis of 2017 had to do with a knee-jerk farm trade policy that tends to clamp down on exports at the slightest hint of rising consumer prices. In June 2014, to rein in potato prices, the government imposed a minimum export price on potatoes, put the commodity under the Essential Commodities Act and also allowed duty-free imports. This choked off exports and caused domestic prices to crash amid a potato glut of 48 million tonnes.To avoid such disasters, India is now looking to setup a national agriculture trade policy, similar to the countrys three-year foreign trade policies. The farm exports policy will be geared towards promoting exports rather than them being used as a tool to control domestic prices, a person familiar with the development said.Last month, the commerce ministry unveiled a draft national agriculture export policy in step with the governments target of doubling farmers incomes. It has sought to boost agricultural exports from $30 billion currently to nearly $60 billion by 2022.Consultations among stakeholders, including the agriculture ministry and the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), began this month. Key proposals include ensuring processed agricultural products and all organic produce will be free of export restrictions in future. The agriculture and food ministries will also identify food items which will be permanently free from export controls.The government may form a trade perspective over a 5-10 year period and undertake a mid-term review of agriculture trade policy... the official said.The agriculture ministry, along with APEDA, has identified 50 farm export clusters, the official said. The Centre will soon hold consultations with states to standardise taxes in local markets for export-oriented produce, he said. For instance, local market taxes vary widely for basmati rice, a key export commodity. It is 4% in Punjab and Haryana and 1.6% in Rajasthan. For pulses, the fees are 1% in Maharashtra and 2.5% in UP.Indias agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This however fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. Farm economist Ashok Gulati says knee-jerk export restrictions on food items to prevent domestic inflation have deprived farmers of higher prices in the global market. A paper by Gulati, Infosys chair professor and Shweta Saini, who works with policy think tank ICRIER, analysed 10-year data to show that Indias agri trade policy had a pro-consumer bias. The governments Doubling Farmers Income also says Indias exports policy does not promote agricultural trade but is mainly used to control prices in the domestic market. According to the new draft policy, a three-year ban on non-basmati rice exports during 2008-11 amid a rice glut led to a notional loss of $5.6 billion."
92,"ITC pips PepsiCo in salty sticks, triangles",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/itc-pips-pepsico-in-salty-sticks-triangles/articleshow/63992723.cms,2018-05-02,The Times Of India,"MUMBAI: A certain subset of the Rs 23,000-crore salty snacks market has come into the spotlight with leading packaged foods companies  PepsiCo India and ITC  in a neck-and-neck race for the market leadership position.The Rs 3,400-crore subset in question is bridges, where ITCs Bingo Tedhe Medhe and Bingo Mad Angles compete with PepsiCos Kurkure . Bridges primarily consist of two formats  sticks and triangles. While most players in the category operate in sticks, the triangular format is pioneered by Mad Angles, inspired by the traditional Gujarati snack khakra. The four broad sub-segments of the salty snacks industry are Indian namkeens (Rs 9,500 crore), potato chips (Rs 5,500 crore), extruded (Rs 4,300 crore) and bridges. PepsiCo and ITC compete in almost all segments of salty snacks. Besides, they also compete in juices.According to industry sources quoting Nielsen data for February and March 2018 in the bridges segment, ITC Bingo, with a share of just over 30%, has overtaken PepsiCos Kurkure by a small margin. ITC has displayed consistency in being a leader in this subset for three months (January, February and March) this year.However, according to Nielsen's moving annual total data quoted for March 2018, quoted by these industry sources, PepsiCo has a higher value share of about 31% as compared to ITCs share of about 30%. MAT data is relied upon by the FMCG industry to get a picture of the rolling yearly sum. However, any event such as a change in leadership  no matter how minor  in a particular month indicates a turning point for a brand.ITC divisional CEO (foods) Hemant Malik said, ITC Bingo is today the market leader in the bridges segment. The category has become a lot more challenging with the expansion of various smaller and regional players. However, ITC Bingo has been steadily growing in the segment and has maintained a very high share vis--vis competition. Tedhe Medhe has been the growth driver for ITC in the bridges segment. The brand continues to grow in double digits every year.PepsiCo India, however, believes the data relating to a subset does not represent a correct picture. In our view, the understanding of the category is important. The bridges category appears outdated and does not hold relevance given the evolution of the snacks market and consumer preferences. PepsiCo looks at the broader extruded segment and so does Nielsen (that includes sub-categories like collet, puffs, triangle-shaped chips and others) where bridges is only a subset. Hence, it is not a like-to-like comparison, said the PepsiCo India spokesperson.In extruded snacks, PepsiCo India has a higher share of 26% (MAT data for March 2018), while ITC is at around 21%. The PepsiCo India spokesperson said considering that salty snacks is a very complex category  with multiple segments and sub-segments operating within it  different manufacturers and brands may assess their performance based on classifications best suited for them in the market. This is done by taking into account factors such as presence of branded products in a segment, average selling price of segment or sub-segment.PepsiCo India, which extended its portfolio with the launch of Kurkure Trangles , is the market leader in salty snacks, which is also the fastest growing category in overall snacks. Our flagship brand Kurkure is growing at a healthy double-digit and we aim to double our volumes on the brand in the next five years on account of regionalisation and innovation, the spokesperson added. ITC, on the other hand, has utilised its in-house culinary expertise of ITC hotels chefs to understand the needs of variety-seeking consumers in different geographies. ITC has a widespread distribution network that plays a critical role in ensuring product availability across the length and breadth of the country.

The cost factor coupled with deliciousness worked wonders for him and his food cart became the toast of K K Nagar and still remains a sought-after snack destination in the locality.Today, at least 500 people on an average visit his eatery every day. Masala vadai, which is available for one rupee apiece, medhu vadai for Rs 2, samosa for Rs 10 (three pieces) and potato bonda, which also costs a rupee per piece, are the in-demand snacks in his food cart. Rengaraj said that his business had turned out to be successful because he didnt get overly ambitious or greedy and that he never liked to increase the cost of the snacks. Selling snacks for a low price has proved to be a win-win for both me and my customers. If they like to have good snacks for a low price I too make a decent profit because so many customers visit my place every day, he said.Apart from vadai, samosa and bonda, adhirasam, which costs Rs 5 per piece and pakoda, which costs Rs 20 (100 grams), are also very popular among the customers. Sometimes the work is so tiring because everything gets sold out the moment they are laid on the tray. But again, I take it as a reward for the quality of the food that is offered at my eatery, Rengaraj said.The 45-year-old owed much of the good reputation that his eatery has earned to his wife, R Kavitha. The food cart is open from 1 pm to 9 pm. Every morning, my wife starts the primary preparation by around 10 am and it is her recipe that has worked wonders, Rengaraj said. Since only the two of them looked after the eatery, they were able to cut costs efficiently.Rengaraj says he lays much emphasis on serving healthy food. I never ever sell leftover food at my eatery. I procure fresh vegetables everyday and also take so much effort to make sure that even the ingredients used are as fresh as possible, he stated."
94,FSSAI plans to regulate GM food,http://www.deccanherald.com/national/fssai-plans-regulate-gm-food-668936.html,2018-05-08,Deccan Herald,"In what appears to be a classic case of putting a cart before the horse, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has released a plan to label genetically modified food in India, months after informing the Supreme Court that genetic foods are not allowed to be sold in India.Last month FSSAI came out with a set of draft rules on labelling and display of food items. The draft carries a section on how food items containing genetically engineered elements should be labelled.The proposal looks straightforward enough except for the fact that genetically engineered or modified foods are not legally allowed to be sold in India till date.The FSSAI had informed the Supreme Court in May 2017 that manufacture, distribution, sale and import of GM food are not allowed in India and could not be regulated till the government opens up the gate through an official notification.The food regulator submitted its response to the top court in connection with a public interest litigation that began in 2006.It is inconsistent and ultra vires for FSSAI to issue a draft notification that allows for GM ingredients, at a time when any selling, stocking, distributing of GM foods itself is illegal, as per FSSAIs affidavit in the Supreme Court. FSSAI must remove this entirely, said Sridhar Radhakrishnan, co-convenor, on behalf of Coalition for GM Free India  an alliance of NGOs that oppose GM technology.The draft rules state: All food products having total genetically engineered ingredients 5% or more shall be labelled. The total GE ingredients shall be of top three ingredients in terms of their percentage in the product. The labelling shall be: 'Contains GMO/Ingredients derived from GMO'.While GM food is not allowed in the Indian market, way back in 2001, environmental group Greenpeace had alleged that two food products purchased from a prominent south Delhi market contained GM elements. One of the products was a popular potato chips brand and the second one was baby food.Greenpeace charges were on the basis of testing the food items from a food testing laboratory in Hong Kong.In its affidavit in the Supreme Court, FSSAI admitted that the issue of labelling GM food is a very complex one that may lead to product cost escalation and the government discussed it multiple times since 2005-06."

This year the government revised and raised the MSP/MIP to Rs 549 per quintal.A low production in various states, including West Bengal, the second largest potato grower after UP, and various incentives offered by the state government for other states to buy potato from UP to help farmers get better price are being seen among main reasons for the potato prices shooting up in UP.While UPs production fell only slightly to around 150 lakh MT from 155 lakh MT last year, the production in West Bengal and Bihar, the other potato growers, has dropped significantly creating more demand for UPs potato there, said a senior horticulture department official. UP produces more than 30% of the countrys potato.Many southern states are said to have sourced potato from UP availing the governments incentives including one on transportation.As per the estimates, there are little chances of the potato prices coming down this year. Many farmers store potato at their home and keep on supplying the same to mandis but once the supply of this kind of potato ends after May, the price may even go up further, said DN Pandey, an ex-official of the horticulture department.The prevailing high prices of potato to much of the benefit of farmers must have come as a big relief to the BJP government that had been under attack from the opposition for the potato growers facing hardships due to their not getting the proper price. The issue was much in news when some farmers allegedly threw potatoes outside the CM residence and the Raj Bhawan as a mark of protest. The BJP had blamed the Samajwadi Party (SP) of stage managing the protests."

Mishra said: ""Following the direction of the state government, we inspected four to five godowns and found that there was no shortage of potato. Yet, the price of potato in the market is high because the price at the sourcing point has gone up.""Mishra said: ""We have not found cases of hoarding so far during our raids which even took place in the Chhatra Bazar godown, one of the biggest markets of the state. But in order to check possible hoarding, food supplies and consumer welfare secretary Vir Vikram Yadav has asked all the district collectors and civil supplies officials to keep a close vigil on supply of potato in the market and ensure availability of the same to consumers at a reasonable price.""The price of potato has jumped to Rs 20 per kg. Last week, it was being sold Rs 16 per kg. Officials said shortage of potato had led to price rise. Consumers have also started complaining about the shortage and sought the government's intervention.Food and civil supplies minister Surya Narayan Patro said: ""We had earlier planned to purchase potatoes thorough Nafed. But as Nafed has quoted a high price, we are yet to take a decision on how to procure potatoes. We have not also decided from where will we procure potatoes.""Officials said the state was facing acute shortage of potato as there was a short supply from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. ""Though there is a good production of potato in Bengal, most of its production goes to Bihar and Jharkhand,"" said an official.In another development, the state government has fixed stock limit for potato at 500 quintal for wholesalers in Cuttack and 350 quintal in cities such as Bhubaneswar, Berhampur, Sambalpur, Puri and Rourkela. For other places, the stock limit is 150 quintal.However, the Opposition said that the state was facing such a crisis only due to lack of foresight. ""The state government should have set up more cold storages and kept the stocks to meet the future needs,"" said BJP leader Manmohan Samal.Traders' associations alleged that their advice to the government to stock potato had gone unheeded.

Taking advantage of such a situation, some traders may resort to hoarding and creation of artificial scarcity in the market,"" the letter read.The collectors of border districts were requested to ensure that flow of potato from the producing states into Odisha is not disrupted. ""Potato is the most essential vegetable in the kitchen and in summer we use more of it. But due to high prices, we have had to cut its consumption,"" said Hemangini Das, a homemaker living in the capital city.The civil supply department on Wednesday conducted raids at several vegetable mandis of Cuttack, including the one at Chhatra Bazar , following Yadav's letter. ""We have conducted raid on 14 vegetable godowns and found no extra stock there,"" said district civil supply officer Amar Mohapatra. Odisha produces around three lakh metric tonnes of potato every year against the annual requirement of around 12 lakh metric tonnes and depends on West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to meet the need."
98,From the house of Mr Biswas!,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/from-the-house-of-mr-biswas/article23859553.ece,2018-05-12,The Hindu,"I went chasing a rainbow, and actually found a pot of gold at the end of it. It was one of those days when there was talk of rain. We thought it called for a nice meal, ordered in, but we were not keen on having Chinese. I felt a Bengali meal would be a good idea, but the local Bengali food takeaway was a bit disappointing when we had last placed an order from there.So I thought I would go looking for Prinsep 21. I had heard about it and had been following it up on the internet. But the place in Noida did not deliver to Mayur Vihar, so I knew that if I had to try the food out, I had to make a visit there. So, that day when the weather  sultry but promising rain  demanded a memorable meal, I went trudging towards Noida in the heat.And I am glad I did  for it turned out to be best Bengali meal Ive had in a very long time. The dhoka  a curried dish of steamed lentil cakes  was so delicious that I made sure some was left over for my breakfast the next morning. That was certainly the first time ever I had dhokar dalna for breakfast!But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the place. Prinsep 21 is in Noida, Sector 51 (Phone numbers: 08010360859and 8470880448). I called one of the numbers up a few times to find the place. The take-away is run from a small room with an attached kitchen in a lane.Wielding a deft karchi is Mrs Biswas. Handling the orders is Mr Biswas. And lending a helping hand is their daughter, Bipasha (and occasionally the son-in-law). The Biswas takeaway offers most of the dishes that Bengalis go gaga over  from mustard rahu to prawn malai curry and from aloo posto to chholar dal.I asked for some rohu jhol, dhokar dalna, chicken rezala and mango chutney. They added aloo bhaja to the food packet.I had a delicious dinner that evening. The potato fries  called jhurjhurey aloo bhaja  were wafer thin and crunchy, and I wished Id ordered some moong dal to go with it. The gravy in the rezala, with plump and juicy pieces of chicken in it, was light, yet full of flavours, with the yoghurt giving it a mildly tart taste. The fish, again large pieces, had been cooked with basic spices  a pinch of cumin seeds, coriander, green chillies and mustard, and was again excellent. But the dhokar dalna took the cake, if you would pardon the pun. The steamed lentil cakes were incredibly soft, full of juices and just lightly spiced. Even the next morning, when I ate them for breakfast, they were as soft as ever.The chutney was sweet and sour, and was a happy end to what was a delightful meal.Mr Biswas told me that their menu depends on whats freshly available. If there is good hilsa or pabda at CR Park, he buys them, and then they are cooked for the day. The menu includes some of the old specialities that are not easily available in Bengali eateries  such as a dish called muri-ghonto, fish head cooked with rice. Some old favourites are also there  such as Kolkata biryani, mutton dak bungalow with eggs and kosha mangsho.The rates are fair. Chicken rezala is for Rs. 240, rui jhol for Rs. 300, dhokar dalna for Rs. 190 and mango chutney for Rs. 70.They have chops, fish fillet fried and pea-filled kachoris, too. There is a whole pomfret on the menu, along with various kinds of fish including mustard pabda.I am happy to have found Prinsep 21  the house of Mr Biswas."
99,The changing terms of endearment,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-changing-terms-of-endearment/article23876235.ece,2018-05-14,The Hindu,"Uttar Pradeshs pivotal importance to Indian politics is hard to exaggerate. Anyone who wishes to rule India must control this State. The Bhartiya Janata Partys (BJPs) biggest win in 2014 came from U.P., which was instrumental in providing Narendra Modi with a clear majority in the Lok Sabha. The party won 73 (with its ally) of the States 80 seats, while its nearest rivals, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress, got only five and two seats, respectively. The BJP repeated this performance in the 2017 Assembly election, winning 325 seats (with its ally) in the 403-member State Assembly, which is about 80% of the seats. No party has ever registered such a colossal tally, not even Indira Gandhi, whose party, the Congress, had won 309 seats in the then 425-member Assembly in 1980.An alienationBut barely a year after its stunning victory the situation has changed significantly. The strongest sign of the changing public mood is the growing alienation of Dalits from the government. Even though many Dalits voted for the BJP in 2014, they feel excluded from access to power and the benefits it brings. Attacks on Dalits have not ceased even after the national furore over the Saharanpur violence in May 2017. A Dalit student of Allahabad University was lynched in February. Some of the BJPs Scheduled Caste MPs from U.P. wrote to the Prime Minister to express their anguish over these incidents. One of them accused the government of only paying lip service and not doing anything for the benefit of the community. This unusual development had occurred just days after the BJP lost in its bastions, Gorakhpur and Phulpur (which is part of Allahabad district), to the SP-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance in the by-elections pushing scores of Dalits towards the anti-BJP camp.Elements of a strategyThe growing conflict between Dalits and Hindutva must be seen in the context of the paradigm shift in U.P.s politics which is increasingly defined in narrow majoritarian terms, even as the BJP is seeking to co-opt the oppressed groups within its electoral umbrella. Two key elements of the BJPs electoral strategy are inclusion/visibility of Dalits and exclusion/invisibility of Muslims. It has shown that it can win elections without Muslims even though they constitute a fifth of the States population, which is larger than the population of several Muslim-majority countries. By contrast, it has made every effort to demonstrate its love for Dalits. But they are unhappy with the terms of endearment since they want greater Dalit representation to address their concerns regarding social exclusion, food preferences, education, employment, housing, and so on.The BJP has consistently used religious polarisation to trump the caste divide in U.P., but it hasnt succeeded; in fact, the divide has been exacerbated by the cold caste and sub-caste calculations of its top leadership to undercut old forms of caste mobilisation. Moreover, the attempts to assimilate Dalits within the fold by invoking the legacy of B.R. Ambedkar or the symbolism of communal inter-dining is not enough to cool tempers of Dalits who face discrimination and atrocities despite the stringent provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The instrumental use of both gestures is obvious to everyone; not surprisingly, these gestures have failed to quell the growing tide of discontent, with many Dalit voters losing patience with the ruling dispensation.Elusive developmentDalit inclusion will work when their core concerns are addressed and when there is overall development, which the State badly needs. Development and economic growth has, of course, been a constant leitmotif in the electoral campaigns of the BJP since 2014. But there is no evidence to show that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is the leader who can deliver development for the State. In fact, the very idea of development was sidelined by his controversial appointment. He was installed as Chief Minister to polarise public opinion on Hindu-Muslim lines, and not to promote integration through development. His elevation signalled a decisive shift from the dual strategy of combining Hindutva and development to a singular embrace of Hindutva which has been used as a weapon of mass mobilisation to offset the fissures of caste, class, language and culture. Asked about Opposition parties linking his speeches and work to Hindutva and not development, the Chief Minister replied that Hindutva and development are complementary to each other... Those who are opposing Hindutva are in fact opposing development and Bharatiyata. In other words, even the optics of development and the claims of taking everyone along through development will be sacrificed at the altar of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2019 election.Going by the policy decisions of his government, the cow appears to be the fulcrum of the U.P. model. It took centre stage in the governments budget with a record Rs. 233 crore allotted for the welfare of cow and dairy development. In a similar vein, social sector spending has been reduced while religious tourism is being given a boost. Mr. Adityanath made a plethora of promises such as building houses, toilets, laying roads and providing 24-hour electricity supply. But these promises are unlikely to be fulfilled, which is causing restlessness even among people who voted to bring the BJP to power in 2017. This is evident from several events in the past few months. In October 2017, sugarcane farmers burned their crop in front of the U.P. Assembly after the government increased the minimum support price by only Rs. 10; in January, farmers unhappy with the minimum support price for their potato harvest dumped the crop in front of the houses of VVIPs in Lucknow; and the much-hyped farm loan waiver turned into a farce as many of the beneficiaries received waivers of amounts as small as Rs. 1 to Rs. 500. The employment situation remains grim, as large-scale government recruitments  the major source of public employment in the State  are not regular and even previously conducted exams, for instance, for clearing the backlog in police jobs have been cancelled. An extravagant UP Investors Summit 2018 held in February to boost investment in the hope of creating employment cannot promote industrialisation and job creation unless the structural constraints of underdevelopment are removed.Closing the gapWhat seems to be working for the BJP is the disarray in the Opposition camp. However, this can change as political majorities are constituted and reconstituted in changing historical and political circumstances. Political majorities are contingent and do not last, at least in part because the Opposition parties make adjustments to capitalise on opportunities. The Mandal (caste) and Mandir (religion) interregnum of the early 1990s signified the arrival of identity politics, which upstaged religious politics that was catapulted by the Ayodhya movement to take centrestage. The ensuing upper caste-backward caste confrontation displaced the Congress from its position of dominance in U.P. and prevented the BJP from reinforcing its political clout despite unprecedented public support for Hindutva in north India for the first time since Independence. Twenty-five years later, in 2104, the BJP closed the gap between the economic and the political sphere with its mantra of development to secure a popular mandate. Currently, the Opposition is making tactical adjustments to counter the overarching narrative of Hindu nationalism. The by-election results demonstrate that if the two main Opposition parties combine, they can give the BJP a run for its money. If there is one State where Opposition unity can upset the BJPs plans for majority rule in 2019, it is U.P.Zoya Hasan is Professor Emerita, Centre for Political Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University"

Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Agra, Moradabadright? Wrong!Its Kasganj, the district that made headlines after communal riots took place there on January 26 this year, having the fourth highest per capita GDP in the state after Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida), Meerut and Lucknow.The department of economics and statistics has prepared total and per capital GDP of all the 75 districts taking the constant and current prices of 2015-16 into account and treating 2011-12 as the base year. The resultant GDP figures circulated to commissioners and DMs on February 22, 2018 show that at Rs 71,294, the per capita GDP of Kasganj is almost equal to that of Lucknow, Rs 71,846.The per capita GDP of Kasganj, a little-known district carved out of Etah in 2008, is next only to Gautam Buddh Nagar that tops the chart at staggering Rs 3,68,081 and Meerut with second highest per capita GDP at Rs 88,273. Even developed districts like Ghaziabad ( Rs 64,907), Kanpur Nagar (Rs 57,308), Aligarh ( Rs 47,849) and Agra ( Rs 68,795) are all behind Kasganj.Explaining the probable reasons for Kasganjs remarkable per capita GDP, director, economics and statistics, AK Pawar said growth in livestock production, especially buffalo meat, rise in minerals and potato production etc during that particular year(2015-16) could have contributed to a high GDP.In 2014-15 also, Kasganj was on the sixth position but this time it has found a place among the states top five districts with regard to per capita GDP, he said adding A higher GDP obviously shows an overall prosperity of a district.Further analysis of the GDP figures shows that while western UP comprising 30 districts has the highest per capita GDP at Rs 62,386, eastern UP with 27 districts has the lowest GDP at Rs 32,360, which is worse than Bundelkhands per capita GDP of Rs 44,446. Central region with 10 districts under it has a per capital GDP of Rs 44,372.Orai in western region, Rae Bareli in Central region, Banda in Bundelkhand and Bahraich in eastern region were found to have the lowest per capita GDP at Rs 31,841, Rs 30,993, Rs 26394 and Rs 21914, respectively.Further analysis revealed that barring five of the 27 districts, no other district in eastern UP has even half the GDP of Kasganj. The five eastern UP districts whose GDP is more than half of Kasganjs GDP are Allahabad, Varanasi, Sonbhadra, Sultanpur and Basti."

(Express Photo)The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) launched biodegradable carry bags made from granules of potato and corn starch in Ludhiana Tuesday.Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu while launching the bags with PPCB officials appealed to the masses to shun plastic bags.Speaking to The Indian Express, Kahan Singh Pannu, PPCB chairman said that these bags are produced from starch granules which can be derived from potatoes, corn and other starch rich products. Currently, five companies have been given license by central government to manufacture these bags. They are based in Bengaluru, Chennai and other places out of Punjab. So we have tied up with them and getting bags on order basis, he said.Currently, no company in Punjab is manufacturing these biodegradable bags which turn into compost after six months if exposed to water or sun or disposed away in garbage.The bags are also costlier compared to plastic ones. Price is a little higher because demand is less and there are not much suppliers. But as soon as common people will start adopting them as substitute for plastic, they will be cheaper. We are making these bags available in small quantity as of now to plastic bags sellers here so that people can start buying them, said GS Gill, environmental engineer, PPCB Ludhiana.PPCB further revealed that at least 225 tonnes of plastic bags are currently used in Punjab on daily basis of which 130 tonnes are used in Ludhiana. This, even as plastic usage is completely banned in Punjab. On Tuesday, plastic manufacturers were also invited at the launch and appealed to shift from plastic bags manufacturing to these biodegradable bags.Pannu said said PPCB is trying to popularize these bags which turn into compost, among the masses. We are holding awareness drives on daily basis. We are facilitating tie up of manufacturing companies with plastic manufacturers here so that they can study the product and plan manufacturing in future, he said.MO Bittu also advised plastic carry bag manufacturers to shift towards manufacturing of compostable carry bags by using starch derived from maize and potatoes.Earlier, the Golden Temple in Amritsar has announced usage of these bags to give prasad.

108,"Break, queen, pocket... carromâ€™s still alive, waiting to strike it rich",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/break-queen-pocket-carroms-still-alive-waiting-to-strike-it-rich/articleshow/64346341.cms,2018-05-27,The Times Of India,"PUNE: In the days of non-existent mobile phones and playstations, long hours spent deflecting wooden coins to round corner holes on a square plywood board was a prime distraction during the school vacations. Indeed, carrom as a sit-down game had a charm of its own then, giving the energetic and raucous street cricket, gilli-danda and kabaddi a run for their money.Parents, as an indulgence or simply to stave off the holiday ennui in their children, would buy a carrom board that lasted till the surface puffed up or the bumpers on the sides spewed wood shavings due to the constant strikes. The less fortunate children from the mohallas and bastis would seek the carrom clubs in their areas, but parental reproach was certain as these places were also known for gambling on games.Carrom remains in a transitional phase but much of the past has seen a makeover, says Shekhar Chavan, a professor with the Suryadatta Group of Institutes in Pune and the secretary of the Poona District Carrom Association. Around 16 carrom houses in Pune city and a few others in Pimpri Chinchwad are registered with the association, abiding by the rules of play as well as decorum. Then there are numerous small carrom clubs which also have players signing up with the association for tournaments.The rules of the game have seen several changes over time. Those who have played carrom at home will know of the 29-point board but international rules now allow for 25-point games, where pocketing the queen fetches 3 points, not 5. The queen is of no value after a player notches 21 points. A contest involves 8 games; the winner is the one who scores 25 points first or who secures maximum points after 8 games are completed. Home shots are still allowed.Gone are the ivory strikers of old, which seasoned players kept safely in cushioned circular cases. Strikers nowadays are made of the same plastic material that is used in snooker balls and weigh 15 grams or less. Coins glide across the board surface aided by boric powder, concerns over its toxicity notwithstanding. Some Western countries prefer potato starch to boric powder.The ongoing Ramzan month sees players coming in droves till late in the night to Irfan Shaikhs carrom house at Kausarbaug off NIBM Road , close to the now-famed iftar eating places. There are 15 boards here, the most any club in the city has. Huddled around these boards, players devote equal time to their play and wiping their sweaty palms, the latter a result of the heat generated from the overhead filament bulbs ensconced in conical metal shades. The fans cant whirr here for relief as the boric powder would get blown away.As at most carrom houses, the charges here are a nominal Rs 30 for an hours play. Shaikh, who runs a furniture business, is obviously putting in his own money to pay for the rent of the premises, electricity and purchase of boards. A new board costs around Rs 7,000, but a good player would practise on it only for one-and-a-half year or so.Chavan justifies this, saying top players today wont chance their skills on lesser boards. Players these days have a very strategic and scientific approach to the game. For instance, you find many a player using the exact same strike power while making a break at the start of every game. The coins too will come to rest in exactly the same position as in the earlier breaks, he says.But while players are increasingly setting the bar higher, the game is still not attracting big bucks. The budget for the nationals held in Pune recently was a trifling Rs 40 lakh. Though the tournament drew around 800 people from all states, including players and officials, the district association had to tap sponsors, MP and MLA funds, central and state aid, and also bring out a souvenir which fetched money from advertisements.Pradeep Bartake (64), who runs Janardhan Carrom House, the oldest one in the city since 1974, agrees that the player profile has gone up over the years and the facilities at clubs are far better. However, incentives or the lure of free participation is important for getting the numbers for tournaments, he says. Giving an example, he points out that the carrom tournament for the mayors trophy around two months back drew 1,450 participants, but quiet a few of them were lured chiefly by the free tracksuits and Rs 300 per day offered to them.There are, however, top-notch players who owe their all to carrom. Like 37-year-old Yogesh Pardeshi, who as a child had seen his family struggling to make ends meet. A winner at the prestigious world carrom championships and two world cups, Pardeshi is now a manager with the Indian Oil Corporation solely for his playing skills. Several other players in the country have landed government jobs too, he says.Governments need to loosen their purse strings too, says Pardeshi. He points out that the Maharashtra government, in an unprecedented move, gave Rs 70 lakh each to three state players who shone in the Birmingham world championship held in 2016.In the end, though, it is purely the love for the game that keeps it going. Pradeep Jadhav (76), a retired dentist, has been playing since 1962 and shows up daily at Shaikhs carrom club after shutting his denture-making shop. He recalls playing at a club near Alpana talkies in the early days where the hourly fee was just two paise. An ivory striker would then cost a princely Rs 9, but Jadhav says he cant get one these days even though he is willing to offer Rs 5,000."
109,Abundant carrot harvest brings down prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/abundant-carrot-harvest-brings-down-prices/articleshow/64346394.cms,2018-05-28,The Times Of India,"COIMBATORE:The vegetable market in Mettupalayam is witnessing a high inflow of carrots. Merchants said the volume was higher than what was in the recent years.Usually during May, the market would see an inflow of 500 to 1,000 bags of carrots a day, said K Abdul Hakkeem , a wholesaler. But this year, around 3,000 bags of carrots have been coming daily, he told TOI.One bag would have 70kg of carrots on average. So in the recent weeks, the market has been seeing an inflow of around 2 lakh kilograms, which was unprecedented as far as he knew, said Hakkeem, who has been trading vegetables for the last 15 years. From the Mettupalayam market, carrots are sent to markets across Tamil Nadu and Kerala.While the copious summer rainfall has ensured good carrot harvest in the Nilgiris , from where carrots reach the Mettupalayam market, farmers said they had also increased the acreage of carrots as they had seen good profit from the crop last season. A kilogram of carrot was sold for as high as Rs 70 last year, said G Ramesh , a carrot farmer from M Palada in the Nilgiris. The good price led several farmers to increase their carrot cultivation area by reducing the area for other vegetables such as beetroot and potatoes, he said. Ramesh himself had increased carrot plantation from five acres last year to 10 this year.Also, we received a good yield this time. There has been a 10% increase in yield per acre. Usually, we would harvest around 250 bags from an acre. This year we have harvested 300 bags, Ramesh said.On the flip side, the boom has resulted in drastic price fall. Compared to last year, carrot price has dipped down to Rs 15 to Rs 20, say farmers and merchants. While we invested heavily in the crop, the high production has turned adverse and has hit the prices, said P Raju, a carrot farmer from Lovedale in the Nilgiris.The area under carrot cultivation in the Nilgiris has significantly increased over the last five years, said officials of the horticulture department. Now carrots are cultivated in around 2,500 hectares, which is a 50% to 60% increase from what was five years ago, said an official. Potato cultivation area has come down and carrots have taken over. Several farmers thought they could at least get back what they had invested if they cultivate carrots, the official added.However, farmers said if they had better logistics and marketing opportunities, they could see better returns."
110,Relief for farmers as potato prices firm up,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/relief-for-farmers-as-potato-prices-firm-up/articleshow/64375723.cms,2018-05-30,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: This February, farmers in the state were forced to sell potatoes they had put in cold storage for just Rs 1 a kg. Three months on, they have some reason to cheer. Wholesale potato prices now range from Rs 9 to Rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. As demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.One reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. Officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. The wholesale price of onions currently ranges between Rs 3.50 and Rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between Rs 6 and Rs 9 a kilogram.Potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. We are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. Any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says Deepak Patel , secretary of the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee.Market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, Patel said.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , says, There are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in Gujarat compared to 2017. Further, Uttar Pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. Farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.Guru said the Gujarat government last year gave Rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. Only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. The number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. Cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.Guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.According to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. The reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output."
111,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperousÂ states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,Indian Express,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The real effect of the strike will be seen after three days when our stock gets exhausted. No matter what we do we cannot make them last for more than three days.Another vendor at Bittan Market, Sunil Sunone, who sets up his weekly shop on Thursdays said, The prices will be doubled or tripled, if the strike lasts for more than four days because there is no stock. Besides, if we have to do our business, we will have to purchase vegetables directly from the farms, which will be more difficult for us. This will lead to a price hike.Consumers are also nervous as they do not know what will happen, if the mandis stay empty for 10 days consecutively. I am trying to stock potatoes and onions in my fridge because nothing else lasts that long. But I can get frozen peas and carrots from supermarkets. But I hope the strike does not last for 10 days, else the situation will get really difficult with each passing day, said Kanchan Ahuja, a yoga teacher.Arjun Soni, a businessman said, The situation may not be that difficult for those, who can afford to buy vegetables at high prices. But the families, who are not financially sound, the strike can cause a lot of panic and shortage of food. I just pray that some conclusion is reached and the farmers demands are fulfilled so that the strike ends soon."

Some vegetables were sold at nearly double the usual rate on Thursday. However, milk supplies were not disturbed as much on the first day of the strike by the farmers from June 1 to 10. Supply of milk was disrupted at Faridkot, Muktsar and Barnala At Pitho village of Bathinda, a milk van was stopped by members of farmer organisation BKU ( Sidhupur ) and the milk was distributed free of cost in the village. Farmer Mohinder Singh of Yatri village in Bathinda, who had grown vegetables on one acre, preferred not to go to the town to sell his produce. He sold the vegetables in his village. He said, In routine I sell vegetables for about Rs 600 per day, but today I earned Rs 1,000 by selling same quantity of vegetables locally.On the other hand, there was not much impact in Patiala. The protest call given by the farmers failed to have any substantial impact on supply of vegetables and milk in the district. While, there was some panic among local residents regarding the strike, but as the day unfolded vegetables and milk was easily available in the market. In addditon, the supply of milk to homes remained uninterrupted all through the day.There were some reports that some commission agents had tried to hoard vegetables such as onions and potatoes to cash on the farmers strike but as it remained ineffective in the district, and their efforts fizzled out during the day."

116,Farmers are not getting a fair price,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-are-not-getting-a-fair-price/article24070354.ece,2018-06-03,The Hindu,"Why the drop in rates?Garlic has been the latest casualty of the price crash in the vegetable market after poor returns of tomato and potato crops forced many farmers to abandon their produce owing to a bumper output in recent days. The miseries of financially distressed farmers seem far from over even as they continue to demand waiver of farm loans and remunerative prices for their produce through several platforms across the country.The problem of plenty has hit the farmers badly. While garlic farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which produce 45% of the countrys garlic, recently fetched as low as Rs. 1 a kg in wholesale prices, the instances of tomato farmers dumping their harvest on the fields earlier this month  be it in Haryana, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh after prices nosedived  have only highlighted their woes. Tomato production during 2017-18, according to the first advance estimate, is likely to be 7.8% higher than that of the previous year. However, it is 20% higher than the average production of the past five years. Similarly, potato production is estimated to be 1.5% higher than that of the previous year. However, compared with the average production of the past five years, it is 8.7% higher. These figures indicate that farmers are producing more without good returns. Why are vegetable farmers not getting a fair price? Season after season, farmers face price uncertainties mainly owing to fluctuations in demand and supply caused by bumper or poor production, speculation and hoarding by traders.Are traders manipulating prices?In Madhya Pradesh, after garlic prices dropped sharply, the government decided to include it in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (Price Deficit Payment Scheme) that was introduced in the Kharif 2017 season. Farmers, however, rue that with the conditions associated with the scheme, most of them are unable to gain any benefit. The scheme is aimed at providing price deficit payments to farmers if the market prices are below the minimum support price. Farmer leaders believe the implementation of this scheme in the first season has resulted in little benefit to farmers, with very little to prevent manipulation of prices by traders. The government claims to have disbursed Rs. 1,900 crore in compensation, but a large section of farmers has been excluded from the scheme, says Jai Kisan Andolan national convener Avik Saha. Those left out bore the brunt of a larger price crash because of market manipulation.What is the way forward?The fluctuation in vegetable prices has become a perennial problem and is usually associated with the economics of demand and supply. Farmers, mainly marginal and small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. Being perishable, vegetables are more prone to price fluctuation, hence they require better infrastructure for storage and marketing. Contract farming is an alternative for farmers to reduce financial risks by providing an assured market for their produce at a pre-agreed price. The Centre last week approved the State/UT Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018. The Act lays stress on protecting the interests of farmers, considering them as weaker of the two parties entering into a contract. The Act is aimed at ensuring the purchase of the entire pre-agreed quantity of one or more of produce, livestock or its product. Although varied forms of contract farming exist in some pockets, a formal system is not widespread. By and large, cultivation of commercial crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber and dairy has had some elements of informal contract farming.Experts believe that integration of vegetable and fruit growers with agro-processing units through contract farming could prove beneficial to producers as it takes care of price fluctuations and helps to mitigate production risk. Pratap Singh Birthal, professor at the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research, says: Under the contract farming law, the agreements would help farmers get an assured price for the produce, which will act as a buffer against price volatility and market fluctuations...Vikas Vasudeva"

Farmers at the local kisan mandis on Sunday were worried about union activists not coming to the cities with the produce.The situation is alarming, said a vendor in kisan mandi in Sector 34. Today, we have received very less quantity of vegetables from Punjab side and are not primarily dependent upon the produce from Himchal Pradesh and down South, he said.Krishan Kant, a wholesaler in Sector 26 grain market said, There has been a fluctuation in prices from past one week, but after the strike the prices of tomatoes and potatoes have shot up as these produces come from Punjab. We fear that there will be short supply of vegetables from Panjab side and if the situation remains the same, the city will face an acute shortage of vegetables. The stocks are perishing.The sellers in kisan mandis said that they are being restricted to bring their produce from the neighbouring areas of Punjab."

Into its third day on Sunday, Kisan Avkash has already witnessed farmers dumping vegetables and milk on streets to hit supplies to urban centres and lead to a rise in prices.Right now, we are clearing the stock we had, but if trucks dont arrive tomorrow as well, prices will definitely go up, said a wholeseller of potatoes and onions. According to him, wholesale prices of both are currently Rs 600 per crate (50kg), making the retail price at around Rs 20 per kg. This will get worse in the coming days. Already, there was no auction of potatoes held today, he said.So far, price of potatoes and onions have not risen, but the price for tomato is already hit. That too, for tomatoes that are mostly damaged, as a result of a poor crop. Earlier, we used to buy a crate (25 kg) at Rs 30. Now, it has gone up to Rs 300, said a wholeseller for tomatoes. As a result, price of tomato has gone up as almost 100%.Vegetable associations said the price hike is not necessarily because of the strike. Most of the produce at Gurugram mandi doesnt come from parts where farmers are on strike. Potato prices could have increased because cold storages have started stocking up in anticipation.Till recently, vegetables were arriving in excess from areas around Gurugram.That has now fallen, with stock now coming from places further away, adding to transportation cost, said Inder Thakran , president of Gurugram Sabzi Mandi Association.At a retail store in Sikanderpur, retailers said the supply is still the same. The strike has had no impact here, as most of our vegetables come from nearby areas such as Pataudi, Rajasthan, etc, said the store manager at Haryana Kisan Mandi Zone Fresh near Bristol Chowk.However, sellers at the mandi said prices of some vegetables, like French beans, bell peppers and even mangoes, could rise if the strike continues. They added that rising prices could be profitable for them. We get less to sell, but can charge more in profits, said a seller, not wishing to be named.Mangoes have already seen a Rs 15-20 per kg rise, after the rate had dropped around two weeks ago.Authorities at the mandi said not much will change unless strikers start obstructing transport that brings in the vegetables to the city, or if the strike spreads to nearby areas.The recent hike is not because of the strike. Some vegetables cant be procured locally. Sellers here have to buy them from Azadpur mandi in Delhi, said Thakran, referring to bell peppers and French beans."
119,Biofuels policy serves many goals,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/biofuels-policy-serves-many-goals-673521.html,2018-06-05,Deccan Herald,"The new national biofuels policy, approved by the Union cabinet recently, has an economic rationale and an environmental dimension. The policy is aimed at expanding the sources of biofuels and increasing their production when conventional fuels like oil are becoming costly. The policy will help to boost the production of biofuels like ethanol by allowing their production from a wider range of raw materials. Till now, only molasses derived from sugarcane could be used for ethanol production. The new policy allows it to be produced from sugar beet, corn, damaged food grains, vegetables like potatoes and crop residue such as wheat and rice stubble and urban and rural solid waste. Farmers can sell their excess produce to ethanol-making units with permission from a committee specially set up for the purpose. Ethanol is blended with petrol so that the consumption of petrol can be reduced. Biodiesel is also produced to cut down on the use of diesel.Most of the raw material that can be used as feedstock for biofuels is going waste now. Farmers can gain additional income by selling them to biofuel producers. Biofuels can also be produced at less cost than now. At present, oil companies find it difficult to get ethanol at economical prices because sugar factories sell it to alcohol producers at higher prices. The use of solid waste and crop stubble for biofuel production will benefit the environment as it will reduce pollution. The hazards of burning crop stubble and the problems of solid waste management are well-known. It is estimated that the availability of ethanol, which is about 2 billion litres now, can be increased to over 40 billion litres in a few years if production is scaled up with multiple feedstock. There is a plan to set up 12 major biofuel refineries which will sell ethanol to oil companies.While the policy and the plans based on it are welcome, they may face major challenges. The technology to make ethanol from feedstock other than sugar molasses is still under development. High investments are needed for setting up biofuel refineries. The logistics of and the infrastructure for collection of feedstock from farms, homes and other places are formidable. There is also the likelihood of misuse of the policy. Sugarcane may be diverted for production of ethanol instead of sugar when sugar prices are low. Similarly, food grains may be used for ethanol production instead of surplus or damaged food grains. The same possibility exists with vegetables also. This will have serious consequences on food security. So, the implementation of the policy should be monitored to avoid unintended and undesirable consequences."

Hira Singh Vegetable Wholesale Market, locally known as Azadpur mandi, said prices of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes had increased.Disruption in supplyThe vendors said potato stock was influenced the least and the price of onions rose only slightly. However, tomato sellers complained of disruption in supply.Subhas Seti, a tomato vendor for the past 47 years, said while 70 vehicles is the norm, only 12 made deliveries on June 2, the second day of the protest. Other wholesalers had similar experiences.Dashrat Kumar, a vendor at Azadpur mandi for the past 12 years, said the supply of tomatoes was considerably low on June 2. He said the price of tomatoes almost doubled when only five of the usual 50 trucks of produce arrived.Anil Kumar, a tomato seller since 1990, sold his stock for Rs. 15 per kg, Rs. 5 higher than last week, because only four of a total of 40 supply trucks were on duty. When asked about the reason for such few trucks, he said the drivers were worried about local agitation and damage to their vehicles in transit.Vendors sympathiseDespite the disruption in vegetable supplies, many vendors at Azadpur mandi sympathised with the farmers.Although Mohammed Javed, a potato vendor, reported an approximate 10% reduction in stock, he said, The farmers are not getting enough money so it is natural that they will be upset and want to strike.While potato prices have not fluctuated significantly, those working with commission agents, like Javed, have suffered losses. The commission agents responded to the strike by increasing their rate of commission by about Rs. 4 per kg, added Javed and other potato sellers at Azadpur mandi. However, many vegetable retailers in the city did not report any significant price fluctuations. Dinesh Kumar, a retailer in Razapur, said, As of now, there is no change in the rate of tomatoes and onions.Asked about what the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) in Delhi was doing to ameliorate the situation, APMC chairperson Adil Ahmad Khan said, What will the APMC do? Our stock comes from outside, so the Modi government has to listen to the farmers demands.Khan confirmed the high prices of tomatoes and said that rates had almost doubled on June 2 due to the perishable nature of the produce.(With inputs fromUrvashi Sharma)What will the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee do?

Stagnation has also hit inland fisheries.The government will also ask itself whether trade of agricultural commodities should continue at APMCs or should they be delinked from APMCs, as has been done for fruit and vegetables.Rupanis team will also analyse the minimum support price (MSP) model and whether it is enough to assure farmers remunerative prices? Team Rupani will also discuss an MSP scheme, called the Bhavantar Scheme (implemented in MP) and whether it could solve problems in the MSP model.Another question is a new model for a micro irrigation scheme. The agriculture department is mulling over whether to opt for the Rajasthan model, which has made it compulsory to adopt MIS for canals. The session will try to devise ways by which contract farming of crops other than potatoes can extended. Making organic farming more popular is another burning question.Seed replacement rateThe seed replacement rate (SRR) for the majority of crops has been quite low in Gujarat for last few years. SSR is a measure of how much of the total cropped area was sown with certified seeds in comparison to farm saved seeds. Thus, when SRR is high, production and productivity is higher, which helps contain food price inflation. Recently, Gujarat State Seeds Corporation Ltd (GSSCL) reported that to increase Gujarats SRR, it had been providing seed subsidies but this has decreased in the last two years. In 2014-15, at-source subsidy for seeds was provided to 2.82 lakh farmers for 1.47 lakh quintal of seeds. In 2016-17, the at-source subsidy came down to 1.38 lakh farmers and 1.31 quintal of seeds till the rabi season.Water erosionGujarat is the state with fourth highest area under desertification or land degradation with respect to the countys total geographical area, according to the 2016 Desertification and Land Degradation Atlas. The document says there has been a cumulative increase of 1,854sq km. (0.94 %) area of land degraded in Gujarat from 2003-05 to 2011-13. The most significant process of land degradation observed in the state is due to water erosion (19.67 % in 2011-13 and 19.30% in 2003-05) followed by salinity (13.48 % in 2011-13 and 13.47 % in 2003-05).Irrigation potential gapOf the total irrigation potential created, the area of land actually irrigated in 2016-17, through canal and groundwater was 41.29 lakh ha. Lower than potential irrigation can be attributed to incomplete distribution system, poor maintenance and improper cropping patterns. If the canal irrigation systems were properly maintained or work completed, 59.63 lakh ha could be irrigated by canal water, against just 21.87 lakh ha today. Consequently, a whopping 19.41 lakh ha is irrigated by groundwater. Thus, there is scope to increase the area under irrigation by bridging the present gap of about 31% between potential created and utilization of irrigation projects."
122,Sharp fall in supplies drives up prices of potatoes in Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sharp-fall-in-supplies-drives-up-prices-of-potatoes-in-delhi/articleshow/64515258.cms,2018-06-09,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: A more than 60% fall in the arrival of potatoes in Delhi has pushed the average price of the kitchen staple to Rs 25 a kg, while in Mumbai prices have touched Rs 24 despite supplies remaining constant in the past one month.Sources said the shortage in supply in Delhi and some other parts of north India has partly to do with the ongoing protests by farmers but the main reason for the rise in prices is a nexus of certain section of traders and middlemen.According to National Horticulture Board (NHB) data, the retail prices of potatoes in Delhi and Mumbai a month back were Rs 24 and Rs 20 respectively. The daily retail prices available in the consumer affairs ministrys price monitoring cell show there was an increase of Rs 10 and Rs 7 per kg of potato in Delhi and Mumbai on Friday as compared to the prices a year back.The consumer affairs ministrys data also show major increase in the prices of the staple food items across Uttar Pradesh and the maximum in Agra (by Rs 13 a kg) despite the state being the largest producer of crop. UP also has the maximum installed cold storage capacity to keep potatoes.The retail average prices in some of the cities in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have also increased by Rs 10 a kg in comparison to the prices of last year.Officials said the issue of increasing potato prices came up for discussion at the weekly meeting of an inter ministerial committee on Friday. NHB officials briefed the panel that there is enough potatoes in stock to meet demand despite a minor dip in harvest during last season.There can be no reason except nexus of certain section of traders and middlemen for the increasing prices. We have been producing 46-47 million tonnes of potatoes while our average consumption is around 40 million tonnes. We have cold storage capacity of 35 million tonnes, which is enough to meet our demand, said an official, who did not wish to be named.Sources said that since movement of agriculture produce is free between India and Bangladesh substantial quantity of potatoes has gone out of the country as domestic production in the neighbouring country was less during last season. Similar, potato production in Nepal also got impacted last season and there are indications of potatoes from India going to Nepal.Officials said prices will moderate in near future as supplies increase."

(REUTERS/Natalka Levina) The highest levels found were about 500 Becquerel per litre  five times over the limit for adults and more than 12 times that for children. (REUTERS/Natalka Levina)Milk in parts of Ukraine has radioactivity levels up to five times over the countrys official safe limit  a consequence of the catastrophic Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant explosion that took place over 30 years ago, scientists say.Scientists from the University of Exeter in the UK and the Ukrainian Institute of Agricultural Radiology sampled cows milk from private farms and homes in the Rivne region, about 200 kilometres from the site of the Chernobyl explosion in 1986.They found levels of radioactive caesium in milk above Ukraines safe limit for adults of 100 Becquerel per litre at six of 14 settlements studied, and above the childrens limit of 40 Becquerel per litre at eight sites. The highest levels found were about 500 Becquerel per litre  five times over the limit for adults and more than 12 times that for children.More than 30 years after the Chernobyl disaster, people are still routinely exposed to radioactive caesium when consuming locally produced staple foods, including milk, in Chernobyl-affected areas of Ukraine, said Iryna Labunska, at the University of Exeter in the UK.Many people in the area we studied keep cows for milk, and children are the main consumers of that milk, said Labunska.Though the level of soil contamination in the studied areas is not extremely high, radioactive caesium continues to accumulate in milk and other foods, such that the residents of these villages are chronically exposed to radioactivity that presents health risks to almost every system in the body  especially among children, she said.Some simple protective measures could be taken to bring radiation exposure levels below limits at a cost of less than 10 euros per person per year for the 8,300 people living in the six villages with the highest contamination.Such measures include applying a caesium binder, called Ferrocyn, to cows, mineral fertilisation of potato fields and feeding pigs with uncontaminated fodder.The cost of this would decrease each year as radiation levels fall  but if no action is taken, the experts warn that milk contamination will continue to exceed the 100 Becquerel per litre adult limit in parts of Ukraine until at least 2040.This situation should also act as a warning and a reminder of just how long the legacy of nuclear accidents can be, said Labunska.Without adequate countermeasures, what may now seem a purely historical event will remain a daily reality for those communities most impacted, she said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Express CACP had recommended MSP for maize at Rs 1,425 per quintal for the year 2018. ExpressJaspal Singh (40), a farmer sitting at the local grain market along with his maize crop, sees no hope for getting a good price for his spring maize crop. The price being offered is Rs 800 to Rs 850 per quintal, the same as the last two seasons; and 40 per cent below the rate fixed for crop by the Commissioner of Agriculture Cost and Price (CACP).Jaspal grows maize on 45 acres, including around 24 acres on lease in Salempur village of Jalandhar. Harvesting of the spring maize crop has already started in Doaba region, the main belt for crop that is grown after potato harvesting in February-March.CACP had recommended MSP for maize at Rs 1,425 per quintal for the year 2018. Also, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley during his Budget 2018 speech had said that under the Swaminathan Commission recommendations, the MSP for the crops would be fixed and farmers will be given 50 per cent more return over their production cost.We are waiting for the price under Swaminathan Commission report, said Jaspal, adding that at least Rs 1,200 to 1300 per quintal minimum price was needed to make the crop viable.Now the new crop is already in the market and the rate is still very low. Government must act as per its promise, he urged.Ajit Singh, a farmer from Kishangarh village, said: We need fair price to survive. Spring maize is gives 36-39 quintal yield per acre due to its hybrid seed and a farmer can earn around Rs 55,000 if sold at the rate of Rs 1,425 per quintal which is recommended by the central government. This year around 38,000 hectares was dedicated to spring maize in Punjab which is sown between February 15 to March 15 after potato harvesting. This maize is mostly grown in Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr, and some parts of Hoshiarpur, Ropar, Ludhiana districts.Director, Agriculture Punjab, Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, said that department mostly recommends the rainy season maize, but several farmers in Punjab go for spring season maize because it is is quite remunerative due to high yield.

126,Driving to devastation,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/driving-to-devastation/article24169131.ece,2018-06-15,The Hindu,"When I was little, I remember reading a story, or perhaps a play, where an Irish family is considering migrating to a new land, America. Moving across the ocean, with little prospect of ever coming back, is daunting. One of the characters is reluctant. But one young man insists: at home, there is nothing. Even if they survive, he says, all they can look forward to is potatoes. More and more potatoes.This little scene got stuck in my head. I couldnt understand why somebody would object to a steady diet of potatoes. Could one ever have too many potatoes? I didnt understand because I had never had to live on a potato diet. No bread. No corn. No rice. It was only recently that I finally understood, once I started reading about the great Irish famine of 1845. It was also called the great potato famine, because the big disaster was a failure of the potato crop.A potato blight meant that suddenly, the vast majority of people had nothing to eat at all. An interactive map released by the Queens University, Belfast, shows that along the west coast, nearly half the population was wiped out.How could this happen? The answer lies in a complex mix of bigotry, oppressive feudalism, and imperialist policies. By the eighteenth century, Englands rulers were largely Protestant. England also controlled Ireland and Scotland in direct and indirect ways. Certainly, the Irish and Scots had their own distinct language and culture. Ireland also had a significant Catholic population that faced discriminatory laws. Catholics could not own property or join the army or hold public office.Many of these laws were repealed before the famine. But land ownership was deeply skewed against the tiller who was being squeezed tighter and tighter. They worked for very meagre wages in exchange for being allowed a tiny plot of land on which they could grow the food that would feed their own families. The only thing that would grow abundantly on small plots was potatoes.The big lords often lived far away, in cities. They neither knew nor cared about the difficulties of their tenants. They appointed middlemen to deliver their share of money. These middlemen further divided and sub-let the land in a way to extract maximum rent.Already, vast tracts of land had been cleared to make way for cattle, to feed the diary and meat needs of England. But the poor did not own this cattle.And once they had been made paupers, their landlords evicted them and flattened their little huts.Worse, there were laws that kept the prices of food artificially high. Cheap grain imports were not allowed, but traders kept exporting grain and livestock. Through the worst of the famine, as millions perished, hundreds of thousands of gallons of butter left Ireland.

127,One Year Of GST: When Over 200 Items Became Affordable,https://www.ndtv.com/business/one-year-of-gst-when-over-200-items-became-cheaper-1876040,2018-07-01,NDTV,"One year of GST: Nearly 177 items were brought from tax rate of 28 percent to 18 percentSoon after the much-awaited indirect tax reform legislation Goods And Services Tax (GST) was rolled out on July 1 last year, several stakeholders, from tax payers to common citizens, raised their eyebrows, and even expressed outrage for prohibitively high rates of some of the items especially the ones that were put in the 28 percent tax bracket. The GST was rolled out with five different tax slabs: zero percent, 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent. Though GST was appreciated as a one-stop solution to all indirect tax related woes and the problem of spate of state taxes and levies, but it was condemned for keeping nearly 250 items in the highest tax bracket, which is 28 percent.Nearly four months after the GST was rolled out, the 23rd GST Council meet that took place in Guwahati on November 10 slashed the tax rates from 28 percent to the lower slabs on over 200 items. The highest tax slab was retained only on 50 'sinful and luxury items' while nearly 177 items were rationalised from the highest tax slab to 18 percent. One of the most lauded moves during the 23rd GST Council meet was to bring restaurant bills under the 5 percent bracket from the earlier 18 percent. Though a lot of items turned cheaper, and affordable, after the GST was rolled out, there are, however, calls to bring other items such as petrol, diesel under the indirect tax regime in a bid to make them cheaper amid crude price hikes that have lately taken the fuel prices in domestic market to unprecedented levels in May this year.These Items saw price cuts during the 23rd GST meeting. Five Things To Know1. The items on which GST was slashed from 28 percent to 18 percent included wire, cables, insulated conductors, electrical insulators, electrical plugs, switches, sockets, fuses, relays, electrical connectors, electrical boards, panels, consoles, cabinets etc for electric control or distribution, particle/fibre boards and ply wood, article of wood, wooden frame, paving block, furniture, mattress, bedding and similar furnishing, trunk, suitcase, vanity cases, brief cases, travelling bags and other hand bags, cases, detergents, washing and cleaning preparations, liquid or cream for washing the skin, shampoos; Hair cream, Hair dyes (natural, herbal or synthetic) and similar other goods; henna powder or paste, not mixed with any other ingredient; pre-shave, shaving or after-shave preparations, personal deodorants, bath preparations, perfumery, cosmetic or toilet preparations, perfumes and toilet waters, beauty or make-up preparations, fans, pumps, compressors, lamp and light fitting, primary cell and primary batteries, sanitary ware and parts thereof of all kind, articles of plastic, floor covering, baths, shower, sinks, washbasins, seats, sanitary ware of plastic, slabs of marbles and granite, goods of marble and granite such as tiles, ceramic tiles of all kinds of miscellaneous articles such as vacuum flasks, lighters and several other things.GST rate cut from 28 per cent to 18 per cent: 1.

Food Processing Industries Federation president P. Bhaskar Rao said Chittoor had been the leading producer of tomato in the State and had a substantial share in the national market.But, since it is a perishable commodity and the farmers and also entrepreneurs are struggling to earn minimum returns from it, the Union government has stepped in to alleviate their plight. The ODOP scheme is applicable for processing industries in food parks established by both the Central and the State governments.Tremendous scopeLike all other agriculture and horticulture crops, only about 5% of tomato is processed, which provides a tremendous scope for venturing into the business of adding value to it.Food parksMr. Rao pointed out that the Andhra Pradesh government was promoting 12 food parks with its own budget in addition to the Central government-sponsored Srini Food Park in Chittoor and Mallavalli Mega Food Park in Krishna district and the one dedicated for aquaculture namely the Godavari Mega Aqua Food Park at Bhimavaram in West Godavari district.Processing unitsIn all, 20 to 25 food parks had been sanctioned by the Centre across the country, but the State had taken the task of promoting the processing units upon itself by setting up its own parks in view of the great importance of the rich variety of crops to its economy and the livelihood of lakhs of farmers."
130,Punjabâ€™s burning problem,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/punjabs-burning-problem/article25341201.ece,2018-10-27,The Hindu,"The highway to Bibipur, a hamlet about 50 km from Patiala town, cuts through acres of paddy. Some of the rice stalk are still a couple of feet high and green but many fields have taken on the distinctive yellow of straw that is ready to be harvested. About 200 km northwest of Patiala, in Amritsar  from where the monsoon winds recede earlier  the fields have already been harvested and readied for the winter crop. In Patiala, this step is still some time away, as the fires attest. Flaming carpets belch white smoke into the clear blue sky along this stretch of highway.Until October 14, 321 cases of fires were recorded in Amritsar. In contrast, there were only 81 in Patiala, according to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, which tracks such fires via satellites and reports them to the government. Punjab alone generates about 20 million tonnes of straw, three-quarters of which are burnt. Behind the generation of such a huge volume of chaff is the increasing popularity of combine harvesters. Farmers prefer these machines as it helps them save on the high labour costs of manual harvesting. But one advantage of manual harvesting is that the stalk which remains is extremely small and does not impede the sowing of fresh seed. But the machines leave stubble shavings that are 6-8 inches high, which if not cleared make fresh sowing impossible.There are just two things needed for the quickest and the cheapest way to get rid of this stubble: diesel and a match box. Not surprisingly, setting the stubble on fire to prepare the fields for wheat has become a common practice in Punjab. Until a few decades ago, the straw generated by the machines was manageable. They could be sold to the packaging industry and also turned into mulch within the field through the natural, slow process of organic decomposition. Now, however, with about 20 million tonnes of straw generated in the State, and barely two to three weeks to dispose them of and prepare the fields for the next crop, cost-conscious farmers are left with few options other than burning the whole lot.For about a decade now, the Delhi administration has been complaining about this practice, holding it responsible for the abysmal air quality in the capital in winter. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal issued a directive to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asking them to ban such stubble burning. The environment ministers of these States as well as top officials at the Centre declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble, which has been estimated to contribute anywhere from 7% to 78% of the particulate matter-emission load in Delhi during winter.Since then, farmers in these States, particularly in Punjab, have been at the receiving end of an arsenal of measures which have ranged from persuasion to threats, incentives and entreaties, aimed at dissuading them from the practice.Are machines the answer?In Bibipur, on an early October evening, a group of farmers have gathered at the village council office, a single-storey structure with a corrugated metal roof. In the buildings porch are what the State (and Central) government consider to be the instruments of emancipation: a Happy Seeder machine, a paddy straw chopper and a super straw management system.Broadly, they are a family of hulking, mechanical attachments hitched to tractors. Between them, they can cut the rice straw, chop it finely, and strew it in the field so that over time it decomposes into mulch and becomes organic manure. The Happy Seeder, in particular, allows the rice straw to be cut, new seed (wheat, in the case of Punjab) to be sown, and the residual chaff to be strewn.Seeders and choppers have a long history in India. Inspired by the design and make of similar implements in fields in the U.S. and Australia, they cost Rs. 1-2 lakh a piece.Until 2016, Gurubans Singh, who is Bibipurs biggest farmer with 70 acres of land, was not convinced about the benefits of mechanised harvesting. Singh, who worked as a senior official in the State excise department, returned to farming post-retirement, leasing out portions of his land to tenants. We have been hearing about the harmful effects of stubble burning for some years now. But there were few practical alternatives, he says.This year, Singh says, he was convinced by an environmental engineer at the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to try out the machines. Further, there was a new scheme, funded by both the State and Central governments, to defray the expense of buying these machines.Earlier this year, the Union Agriculture Ministry earmarked Rs. 591 crore for disbursal to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the idea being to help farmers access these machines. Individual farmers could buy them at half their retail price; if bought through self-help groups, they got an 80% discount. In Bibipur, Singh and nine other farmers got together and formed such a group. The cost price of the equipment in the Bibipur council office yard is Rs. 10 lakh, but thanks to the government scheme, Singh and his associates bought it for Rs. 2 lakh.According to Hardeep Singh, a local farmer, there are about 800 households in Bibipur, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields that are ripe for harvesting. These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are just three to four machines available [for a variety of tasks such as cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw] for all of us, says Hardeep. That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. But farmers have barely two months  from mid-September to mid-November  to clear out the field. This year, delayed rains have shrunk that window further, and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times in keeping with subtle weather differences. In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, says Hardeep.Given the narrow harvesting window, farmers who require the machines have to line up at the village office to rent them, at Rs. 150 per hour. These machines, now gleaming as they are fresh from the factories, will last about seven to eight years, during which they would lie idle for 11 months in a year. There are servicing costs as well. Sub-optimal machines could backfire and even reduce the yield of the wheat. Servicing and maintenance costs, however, are not included in the government subsidy.Even Singh, who is optimistic that farmers in his village would, like him, whole-heartedly eschew stubble-burning doesnt expect it to happen this year. There also remains to be addressed the matter of inadequacies in the harvesters. For instance, the implements that Bibipur has procured are suitable for large tractors, whereas many farmers here only have smaller ones. This problem is prevalent in other villages too.In Rolu Majra, a village in Rupnagar, Ajaib Singh, 58, who has three acres of paddy, points out that to derive optimum results from the Happy Seeder machine, a tractor with a capacity of 45-55 hp is required. I have a tractor of only 35 hp. Tell me how can I use this machine in my field? The government is pushing these machines without realising that they are not viable for small and marginal farmers, and that they will only increase their straw management costs, he says, adding that given the speed at which the Happy Seeder machine operates, it would take several days to sow wheat as farmers in the village would have to use the machine turn by turn. This would mean that the farmers either have to lease bigger tractors to use these implements or procure customised implements that may cost them more. Just one self-help group in a village is not adequate. What we hope is that by next year (the subsidised-implements scheme is expected to continue) there will be greater supply, Ajaib says.According to government figures, there are around 1.85 million farming families in Punjab, of whom 65% are small and marginal farmers. Of the 5.03 million hectares of land in Punjab, around 4.23 million hectares are under cultivation. Patiala has about 270,000 hectares under cultivation, and in line with the rest of the State, follows a rice-wheat cropping pattern, with rice sown in July and harvested in October-November, while wheat is the winter crop harvested in March-April.A routine practiceAbout 100 km from Bibipur, in Ludhianas Rola village, a paddy field that is barely an acre, is on fire. Upendra, a daily wage labourer from Bihar, is navigating the periphery of the field with a thresher, pushing in stray clumps of straw into the flames to ensure they burn better. He says he is merely following instructions from his paymaster (a farmer whose name he does not know) for Rs. 300 a day.Sarabjit Singh, another farmer from Rola, says that for him, burning the paddy field after harvest is a routine, annual practice. He adds that in his village and for 50 others in the region, no machines have been made available nor have there been any awareness programmes on the harmful effects of burning.State government officials, however, claim that Punjab had disbursed about 8,000 farm implements to individual farmers and set up 4,795 custom hiring centres, from where such machinery could be leased. The cost of hiring these machines, according to Sarabjit, was Rs. 5,000 an acre, and setting the field alight only cost him a few litres of diesel. The per-acre costs also vary depending on the size of the landholding and the cost of fuel on a given day.This narrative, of many farmers being too poor to afford the machinery, is one that State pollution control board officials routinely encounter through the year.Until mid-October, the PPCB had levied Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they have managed to collect only Rs. 3,05,000, according to PPCB figures.The fines are collected over time. Often the farmers do not have the money to immediately pay these fines, says Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, PPCB. Another PPCB official, on condition of anonymity, says that they often do not enforce the fines as these work out to about Rs. 2,500 per acre. Officials say that satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complicated affair. We get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to identify the farmer concerned. Sometimes the farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence, and sometimes poverty, says the officer, who is tasked with following up on stubble burning incidents in Punjab.There is also the danger of violence. The cropping and harvesting seasons are highly stressful times for the farmers who have their hands full coping with uncertainties on the procurement and weather fronts. There have been instances when our officials were gheraoed, or asked why am I being punished, when youve let my neighbour get away, and then there are the farmer unions backed by different political groups. These are complications that we face every year. This year is no different, says another PPCB official.Jaspal Singh, another farmer from Ludhiana, says that rising diesel prices are another factor that farmers bear in mind when choosing between mechanised stubble harvesting and merely burning the field. The machines consume about five litres of diesel per acre. If we grow potato, then about 20 litres. The cost for potato is higher because it is not possible to deploy a Happy Seeder, which is only equipped to thresh rice-straw and sow wheat. In other words, other instruments, such as the mulcher plough, are needed to prepare the field for potato, which would add to the costs.In Punjab and Haryana, there are restrictions in place on how much groundwater could be drawn, as farmers in these States like to flood their fields to sow the rice crop. This, according to Jaspal, has further narrowed the window to a mere two-three weeks for clearing out the rice stubble, forcing farmers like him to burn away the stubble.The government lineBut officials from the PPCB insist that enforcement of the stubble-burning ban has been stepped up, and so far, there have been fewer fires this year when compared to the same time frame last year. From September 21 to October 21 this year, there were 2,589 cases of stubble fire in the State compared to 7,613 such cases during the corresponding period last year.There has also been independent confirmation (though relying on the same satellites) of this decline from Hiren Jethva, a U.S.-based researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-affiliated Universities Space Research Association. Jethvas analysis of crop fires in Punjab and Haryana between October 1 and October 22 suggests that there were 12,194 instances of fires in 2017 and only 5,893 this year. There had been 16,275 of these in 2016.For Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, this is a sign that government intervention is working. We have scaled up several measures this year. Now the crop residue is also being used for seven biomass-based power projects with a combined capacity of 62.5 MW, he said at a recent media briefing. We are educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys the soil nutrients and increases their fertilizer requirement. We have run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier, just Rs. 300 more per acre, than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as their health.Apart from efforts to motivate farmers to sell their field residue to power generation companies, the administration is also trying to build a narrative on how stubble-burning damages the soil.According to Punjabs Additional Chief Secretary (development), Viswajeet Khanna, burning a tonne of paddy straw leads to the soil losing about 5.5 kg of nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, 25 kg of potassium, 1.2 kg sulphur, and 400 kg of organic matter, besides causing the death of useful microbial population. Currently, about 4.30 million tonnes of paddy (21.82% of the total paddy straw generated) is being consumed by various stakeholders, as opposed to being burnt in the fields.Pointing out that mechanisation is not the sole answer to the problem of stubble burning, Umendra Dutt of Kheti Virasat Mission, an organisation promoting organic farming, says that mechanisation is only a partial solution, since most of these machines would be used for just a month and lie idle for the rest of the year. Instead, farmers should be motivated to diversify their crops, focussing on domestic diversification and not just commercial diversification.Yet, even the most optimistic of pollution board authorities, be it in Punjab or Delhi, is not expecting instances of stubble-burning to drop down to zero. In his briefing a fortnight ago, Garg said that 80,879 fire incidents were detected during the season in 2016, and 43,660 in 2017. This year, we expect a 50% reduction, he said. This is roughly in line with the reduction last year. Garg also contends  and this is a widely prevalent view among farmers in Punjab as well as among other PPCB officials  that the pollution from stubble-burning in Punjab contributes minimally to Delhis pollution. We frequently see that air pollution remains low in Punjab but becomes very high in Delhi. Surely, if stubble-burning is a major factor, would not that be reflected here too? he asks.While studies over the years have established that pollutants can travel great distances and survive in the atmosphere for a long time, the contribution of Punjabs stubble-burning to Delhis winter smog has not been precisely determined. A Harvard University study published in March 2018 said that 7-78% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is due to agricultural fires.Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and an expert on air pollution, says that the relative contribution of crop burning to Delhis pollution episodes is over-emphasised and gives a simplistic explanation for severe pollution episodes. Stubble burning does play a role, but our recent studies show that 60% of Delhis pollution is due to a wide range of sources within Delhi NCR, such as industries, coal burning, and vehicular emissions. Efforts should be made to address them too.Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as the health of farmers.Krunesh Garg,Member Secretary, Punjab Pollution Control BoardIn many cases there is no option but to burn because it is quick and cheap.Hardeep Singh,Farmer"

The issue had also taken political colour with people announcing to hold a massive demonstration at district headquarter Keylong on November 3.Markanda said while the ban is continuing on other potato producing areas of some states, Lahaul-Spiti farmers would get good price for their produce as only they would be marketing the quality seed potato.He said besides lifting ban on potato, the Centre has also agreed to provide Rs 37 crore compensation to the residents of the district in lieu of damages suffered due to heavy snowfall. During the meeting, I informed the Union minister and other officials about the damage to 80% of apple crop and trees, he added."

Pushparaj, Chairman of AP Food Commission, at a press conference here on Wednesday.He said the Commission had reviewed key issues of ICDS projects, mid-day meal scheme, targeted public distribution system and maternity entitlement under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana scheme. Mr. Pushparaj said the government was keen on improving quality of food and nutrition levels for beneficiaries of PDS through fair price shops but the result was not on expected lines at the ground level.He said fortified rice was being given to Anganwadi centres and for the mid-day meal scheme in the districts of Krishna, Guntur, Kurnool and West Godavari. The Commission had also recommended supply of unpolished rice (brown rice) as diabetes was rampant in rural areas of Krishna, Prakasam and West Godavari districts. Similarly, red gram, sugar and millets like ragi and jowar besides double fortified salt were being supplied but the consumption was very low. The food commission chief said the civil supplies wing should take up an extensive campaign to make people aware of the significance of consuming food items with high nutritional value.Aid for Titli victimsHe said the Civil Supplies Department had distributed rice, dal, ragi, sugar, palmolien oil, potatoes and onions to the 2.48 lakh cyclone-affected victims.He said based on a recommendation by the Food Commission, the government had asked for constitution of district-level task force, a five-member body to prevent recycling of or supply of inferior quality rice. Many of the districts have not constituted the task force till date, he said. Following complaints of corruption in supply of eggs to Anganwadi centres and mid-day meal schemes, the State had decentralised the purchase system and had blacklisted the three suppliers, he said. Commissions member-secretary Ravi Babu said a legal cell had been set up to take action against those resorting to malpractice."

The scheme was announced in the budget speech of 2018-19 with an outlay of Rs 500 crore to stabilize the supply of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) and to ensure availability of these crops throughout the country round-the-year without price volatility.Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a press release on Monday, said, Price volatility of TOP crops wreak havoc in the households of this country. This scheme has been prepared after sustained talks with all stakeholders and we will ensure that the TOP crops reach all households in the country all through the year.She said the government had laid down special measures and grants-in-aid under the scheme to ensure enhanced production of TOP crops and to augment value chain. Operation Greens aims to enhance the value realisation of TOP farmers by targeted interventions. These interventions would range from strengthening of production clusters and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) and connecting them with the market to price stabilisation for both producers and consumers through a proper production planning. The measures would include introduction of dual use varieties, reduction in post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, development of suitable agro-logistics, creation of appropriate storage facilities linking consumption centres and increase in food processing capacities. Operation Greens also envisages setting up of a market intelligence network to collect and collate real time data on demand and supply and price of TOP crops.The ministry would provide 50% of subsidy on transportation of TOP crops from production to storage and hiring of appropriate storage facilities, the minister stated."
134,WPI inflation hits 4-month high; RBI may maintain status quo in next policy review,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wpi-inflation-rises-to-5-28-pc-in-oct-on-costlier-fuel/articleshow/66616862.cms,2018-11-14,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Inflation-based on wholesale prices spiked to a four-month high of 5.28 per cent in October mainly due to rise in fuel prices, but the RBI is likely to maintain status quo in its next monetary policy review as crude prices and currency are stabilising.The Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation stood at 5.13 per cent in September and 3.68 per cent in October last year.Food articles witnessed softening of prices with deflation at 1.49 per cent in October, against 0.21 per cent September, government data released on Wednesday showed.Vegetables too became cheaper with deflation at 18.65 per cent in October, compared to 3.83 per cent in the previous month.Inflation in 'fuel and power' basket in October spiked to 18.44 per cent, from 16.65 per cent in September. Individually, in petrol and diesel it was 19.85 per cent and 23.91 per cent, respectively, and for liquified petroleum gas (LPG) it was 31.39 per cent during October.The WPI inflation is in contrast to the retail or consumer price index-based inflation data released earlier this week. The October CPI inflation had cooled to a year-low of 3.31 per cent.ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said the uptick in the WPI inflation in October reflected the impact of the pass through of higher commodity prices and the rupee depreciation. The disinflation in food prices had a much smaller impact on wholesale inflation than the CPI, given the difference in weights for food items in the two indices.""Despite the change in the monetary policy stance to calibrated tightening and the uptick in the core-CPI and core-WPI inflation in October 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) appears likely to maintain a status quo on the repo rate in the December 2018 policy review, following the decline in the October 2018 headline CPI inflation, the deep correction in crude oil prices, and the pullback in the INR,"" Nayar said.The RBI is scheduled to come out with its fifth bi-monthly policy review statement on December 5.She said that the easing in the crude oil prices and the recent strengthening of the rupee, would keep WPI inflation range bound between 4.5-5 per cent in October-March period.Nayar said the core WPI inflation hardened to a three-month high of 5.1 per cent in October, reflecting the impact of the rupee depreciation on the landed price of imports.""While the uptick in both the core-CPI and core-WPI inflation in October 2018 warrants some caution, the recent pullback in the rupee and crude oil prices has softened the risks to the inflation trajectory,"" she added.The Indian rupee had touched the record closing low of 74.39 in October, and ended the month with total losses of 104 paise or 1.43 per cent due to a strengthening dollar, firming oil prices and trade worries. Since then the currency has recovered and is now trading around 72.2 to a dollar.Brent crude, the international benchmark, was trading around USD 76.25 per barrel in October. The brent crude futures is now trading at USD 65 to a barrel.To cushion the impact of global fuel price rise, the government had, with effect from October 5, cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre and asked state-owned oil firms to subsidise the fuel by another Re 1 a litre.The 5.28 per cent inflation is the highest in four months, and a higher inflation than this level was last seen in June at 5.68 per cent.Among food articles, potato prices continued to rule high with 93.65 per cent WPI inflation in October. While onion witnessed deflation of 31.69 per cent; the same for pulses stood at 13.92 per cent.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mainly takes into account retail inflation data while formulating monetary policy.In its fourth monetary policy review for the fiscal, released last month, the Reserve Bank maintained status quo on the benchmark interest rate but warned that volatile and rising oil prices, and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial risks to the growth and inflation.For October-March, the RBI pegged CPI-based retail inflation to be between 3.9-4.5 per cent."

Later, hundreds of protesters entered the bottom of the street dotted with luxury shops where the palace is located  and where Macron lives  before being pushed back by security forces with shields.In a similar scenario, police cleared out the huge traffic circle around the Arc de Triomphe, paralyzed for hours by protesters.French Interior Ministry officials counted nearly 283,000 protesters, mostly peaceful, throughout the day at more than 2,000 sites, some setting bonfires or flying balloons.However, some demonstrations turned violent. In Troyes, southeast of Paris, about 100 people invaded the prefecture, the local representation of the state, damaging the inside, Interior Ministry officials said. In Quimper, in Brittany, security forces used water cannon to disperse hostile protesters.The protester who died, a 63-year-old woman, was killed when a driver caught in the blockade accelerated in a panic at Pont-de-Beauvoisin, near Chambery, in eastern France, according to Louis Laugier, the prefect, or top state official, in the Savoie region. A confrontation with protesters ""got heated up for no reason"" and the driver accelerated her minivan after ""people started rattling her car,"" a protester who witnessed the incident told BFMTV, identifying himself only as Philippe. He said the woman told them she was taking her daughter to a doctor.An investigation into the death was opened.Eight of the 227 people injured were in serious condition, ministry officials said at an evening briefing, without providing details. A police officer and a firefighter who intervened when protesters attacked a closed service station were among the eight.A total of 117 people were arrested with 73 of them held for questioning.The protesters had pledged to target tollbooths, roundabouts and other strategic traffic sites. They called themselves ""yellow jackets"" because most were wearing the fluorescent yellow vests that must be kept in vehicles of all French drivers in case of car troubles.The daughter of the woman killed called for calm as she protested in Cavaillon, in southern France.""I really want people not to let themselves become submerged by anger,"" Alexandrine Mazet told RTL radio. ""The yellow jackets must understand this is a peaceful movement,"" she said. The young woman appeared later on BFMTV still wearing her yellow vest.The nationwide protest was unusual because it arose from within the citizenry, backed neither by unions nor politicians, although some took part in a clear bid for supporters. It was unclear whether the upstart movement, without a leader, would survive, and what problems it might pose for Macron.The grassroots nature of the protests, which drew supporters angry over an array of issues, made it a political hot potato for Macron's government. Security officials treaded lightly, ordering police to use dialogue rather than force but to stop protesters from completely blocking major routes or endangering lives or property. About 30 canisters of tear gas were fired to disperse protesters at the entrance of the Mont Blanc tunnel.""They have sent a message,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. ""It is heard. The government is attentive to all demonstrations and, of course, we must continue to answer the expectations of the French including those about their purchasing power.""The planned increase in fuel taxes, notably for diesel fuel, spoke to those French who feel the president has asked ordinary citizens to make the largest efforts in his bid to transform France. Those French who have a hard time making ends meet often rely on cheaper diesel fuel.Macron wants to close the gap between the price of diesel fuel and gasoline as part of his strategy to wean France off fossil fuels. A ""carbon trajectory"" calls for continued increases. Taxes on diesel fuel have risen 7 euro cents (nearly 8 U.S. cents) and are to keep climbing in the coming years, Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne has said. The tax on gasoline is to increase 4 euro cents.Many drivers see this as emblematic of a presidency they view as disconnected from day-to-day economic difficulties and serving the rich.Macron's popularity has plunged, hovering around 30 percent. Robert Tichit, 67, a retiree, referred to the president as ""King Macron.""""We've had enough of it. There are too many taxes in this country,"" he said.More than 1,000 protesters congregated at the Place de la Concorde at the bottom of the Champs-Elysees, shouting ""Macron resign"" as police looked on."
136,Onion prices hit rock bottom,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/onion-prices-hit-rock-bottom/article25553027.ece,2018-11-21,The Hindu,"The price of onions has seen a steep fall in the last two weeks with 1 kg being sold for as little as Rs. 2 in Bengaluru wholesale markets. Three days ago, premium quality onions were being bought from farmers in the range of Rs. 12 to 15 per kg, but their prices also crashed to below Rs. 10, by Monday. In other parts of the State, farmers are being forced to sell their crop for Rs. 1/kg.Distressed, the farmers in Bagalkot district recently protested by throwing onions on the road and staging rasta roko. Similar agitations were held by farmers in Hubballi. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, which also held a protest in Bengaluru on Monday, has demanded that the government announce a minimum support price (MSP) and open centres across the State for the purchase of onions. We spend more on transporting onions from the farm to the market than what we get, said Hanumanthappa, an onion farmer from Amingad, Raichur district, who had come to Bengaluru on Monday to protest.Basavaraj, another onion grower from Chitradurga, felt the government must announce an MSP and buy their stock. Last year, onions got good price as a kg went up to Rs. 30 in the wholesale market. We were expecting a similar situation this year, especially after Deepavali. But, we have now incurred huge losses, he said.According to Ravi Kumar from the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Bengaluru, there has been a glut of onions in markets across the country leading to crashing prices. Supply has far outmatched demand for onions in the market. In the last two weeks, markets in Alwar, Rajasthan; Ahmednagar, Maharashtra; and Belagavi, Karnataka have been shut down for days, and they havent bought onions as the existing stock is still unsold, he said.Why the glutWith a bumper onion crop this year, crops from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have flooded the market, while the harvest season in the State has yet to end.To add to this, onions from Pakistan and Afghanistan have flooded Punjab and Delhi markets.We dont see the situation improving till the harvest season for the crop is over and stocks are cleared. In fact, we foresee a further drop in prices, said a procurement official from a prominent retail chain in Bengaluru.One kg of onion is still being sold at Rs. 20/kg in the retail market and the prices are expected to crash this week."

Another delegation from Ukraine in central Asia is scheduled to visit the state to explore business opportunities in organic vegetables.Khorlo Bhutia, the secretary of both the agriculture department and Sikkim Organic Mission, said delegations of two Japanese companies, Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan and Kowa Company Ltd, and a team from the trade office of the South Korean embassy had held exploratory talks.The Japanese are also interested in importing sticky rice produced here. Sticky rice is being grown in 0.2 hectares of land at Kameray village in East Sikkim on an experimental basis. Even though it is being done on a trial basis, we are confident of its success, said Bhutia.South Korea, on the other hand, wants to import vegetables like garlic, zinger, cabbage, chilies and buck wheat.Even though Sikkim is a certified organic state, the Japanese and Koreans will conduct their own tests in their respective countries to see if the produce from here meets their standards.Once they are satisfied, they will start importing Sikkims organic produce, said Bhutia.D. K. Bhandari, the Sikkim horticulture secretary, said once those countries started importing local produce, it would give the agriculture sector a massive boost and provide business opportunities to the youth.We would like to appeal to the unemployed educated youth to take advantage of the opportunity by adopting organic farming and allied businesses, he said.Even though Sikkim is a fully organic producing state, it is not yet a fully organic consuming state because of multiple reasons, including massive gap between demand and supply, lack of production of certain vegetables like potatoes and onions, and the high cost of organic vegetables as compared to non-organic ones.Sikkim produces 91,000 metric ton of organic vegetables annually, but its requirement is 1,20,00 metric ton. In April this year, the state had imposed a ban on the sale of non-organic vegetables barring five items, including onions and vegetables. As the ban was ineffective, the government lifted the restriction on five more vegetables last month."

The phenomenon is a throwback to previous years when farmers had dumped huge stock of potatoes on the streets of Deesa or fed them to cattle due to plummeting returns.This year, the demand from states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra has slumped over the last fortnight and the prices of potatoes have fallen by 20-30%. As a result, nearly 40 lakh bags (each containing 50 kg potatoes) are lying in the 200 cold storages in and around Deesa. The prices have fallen from Rs 1,000 per quintal to Rs 700-Rs 800 per quintal in the last fortnight, said Ganpat Kachwa, president of Cold Storage Owners Association.If the same position persists and the stock does not get cleared by the end of December, prices will plummet further and the farmers will have no go but to repeat what they do as a mark of protest - dumping their stock or donating it to cattle-sheds (gaushala), Kachwa told TOI. As a mark of protest, all storages had observed a bandh on November 18.However, the sources in agriculture department say that the total cultivation may not be at par with 2017 when the tuber was sown in nearly 66,000 hectare area. This year, the sowing has begun and, by November 22, the cultivation was completed in 37,755 hectares. During the corresponding period last year, the cultivation was done on around 40,000 hectare land in Banaskantha district.Deputy director of agriculture P K Patel said the cultivation usually gets over by first week of December."

Let Karam (trade) follow Dharam (religion). Our only wish is that Wagah is opened for trade. It holds immense potential for Punjab and for other neighbouring states as well as for Pakistani Punjab, said Rupinder Singh Sachdeva, chairman of Punjab chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce.Industry sources said that due to restrictions only a few items can be sent through land route. Importers and exporters on both sides have to send or receive items through sea route. First industrialists from Punjab send products through Kandla (Gujarat) or Nhava Sheva (Maharashtra) ports to Dubai from where these are sent to Karachi port and then to Punjab in Pakistan. What can reach there just by covering 40-50 km covers thousands of kilometres. It would not only help the business thrive but the environmental impact would also be good with things reaching there through very short route, he added.An exhibition and trade fair is being organized by the chamber from December 6 to 10 at Amritsar. It was started in 2005, when Captain Amarinder Singh was the chief minister. This is the 13th edition of the fair,Sachdeva said.However, earlier exchange of business delegations was better. For the last three years, both the countries are not giving visas easily. This time also we are getting only 4-5 exhibitors directly who have SAARC visas and others would be holding their stalls through their local contacts or dealers. The businessmen from there now have stopped applying for visas as the wait for visa was being made torturous, Sachdeva revealed.Echoing similar sentiments Chamber of Industry and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja, whose unit at Ludhiana manufactures auto components, farm machinery and bicycle components, said that there was immense potential of trade with Pakistan. We have been demanding for the last 20 years that trade with Pakistan should be opened, he said.Trade with Pakistan holds key to huge markets further and Punjab cen benefit from it immensely, said Hand Tools Manufacturing Association secretary Ashwani Vitcor.Farmers also raise voiceIf export of potatoes is allowed to Pakistan then all the growers can be saved, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha. Here we are going in losses for third consecutive year while prices of potato are very good in Pakistan.

140,Can Mars be colonised in the near future?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/science/can-mars-be-colonised-in-the-near-future/cid/1677328,2018-12-02,Telegraph,"Aaah... soaking up the Sun with my solar panels. After a long flight, and a thrilling landing, it feels great to get a good stretch and recharge my batteries. Its just what Ill need to really start getting in tune with this planet, reads Tweet 1. And then, Theres a quiet beauty here. Looking forward to exploring my new home.These two tweets from @NasaInSight  the official handle of Nasas InSight mission to study Mars interior  read almost like messages from a human explorer on the Red Planet. The tweets were posted along with snapshots clicked by InSight soon after it landed on November 26 on the planet next door. The spacecrafts mission is to probe whether the planet could be made habitable for humans in the future.The day before InSight landed, Elon Musk, billionaire founder of private space exploration company SpaceX, expressed confidence that he, too, would one day travel to the Red Planet. On the Axios channel, he said, Weve [SpaceX] recently made a number of breakthroughs that I am just really fired up about. Im talking about moving there. He speculated that humans could take a flight to Mars in another seven years  with tickets costing around a couple of hundred thousand dollars  on, he warned, a one-way journey. Once you land successfully, youll be working nonstop to build the baseits a very harsh environment. Theres a good chance you die there.Musk, serial entrepreneur, innovator and visionary, famously founded SpaceX because he was frustrated by the amount of time Nasa was taking to fly a human mission to Mars, forget about building a settlement there. His obsession to build a Martian colony got fast-tracked when experts warned that climate change could lead to a catastrophe on this planet far quicker, and bigger, than feared, making Earth inhabitable.While Musk wishes to escape the Blue Planet, tech billionaire and entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, is worried Earth will soon exhaust its resources. He told Wired magazine in a recent interview, Earth is destined to run out of resources...Humans need a Plan B. Bezoss Blue Origin is building New Glenn, a large re-usable rocket, to fly satellites beyond Earths orbit and humans into space and to the Moon and Mars. The team behind the spaceship hopes it will lay the foundation for a new type of economic activity in space.Meanwhile at SpaceX, Musks vision is more focused  sending humans to Mars in his lifetime. This September, the SpaceX CEO laid out his blueprint for a colony on Mars, which, Musk says, would be feasible within a decade. He imagines hundreds of spaceships leaving Earth every few years, transporting a million people when the two planets come closest to each other.Apart from Musk and Bezos, billionaires such as Richard Branson, Paul Allen, Yuri Milner and Robert Bigelow too have outlined their ambitious ventures to explore deep space and far-off planets.But how realistic is the vision of colonising Mars? The temperature on the surface of Mars ranges from about 0C during the day to nearly minus 120C at night, its gravity is one-third the gravity on Earth and its thin atmosphere, mostly made up of carbon dioxide, cannot deflect harmful radiation from space. Transforming the inhospitable Martian environment into a place astronauts could explore without life support is not possible without technology well beyond todays capabilities.Recent Mars exploration, however, has proven that there is a lot of water on Mars and once there was flowing water on the surface. Now, most of it is mixed with Martian soil, or regolith. Besides, theres frozen ice on the surface of the planet, at the poles and some water in its air. Stephen Petranek, author of How Well Live On Mars, has detailed several methods future colonists could employ to amass a drinking water supply. Some of these processes have been demonstrated by Nasa scientists and showcased in the 2015 Hollywood movie, The Martian.In the Nasa Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Program, scientists are busy working in Mars room, a test chamber capable of simulating the Red Planets atmospheric pressure, day-night temperature changes and solar radiation that cascades on to the planets surface. They are testing the viability of using organisms, such as bacteria and algae to churn out oxygen using the Martian regolith. Growing potatoes and other food on Mars is also not just a sci-fi curiosity, said a recent Nasa-backed experiment in Peru. In the movie, The Martian, a fictional botanist-turned-astronaut stranded on the Red Planet was shown surviving by fertilising Martian soil with his faeces and planting cuttings of potatoes in the soil. This eventually grows him enough food to last 560 days before he is rescued.When Nasa has so much technological knowhow on Mars, why hasnt it embarked on building a colony on the Red Planet? Alok Chatterjee, project engineer at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, US, tells The Telegraph, Nasa has the technology but does not have the money and mandate to colonise Mars in the near future. Private industry is vying for this but they have to depend on the technology pioneered by Nasa over the years.According to him, it will take an act of Congress  on the lines of the Apollo Moon programme in the 1960s  for Nasa to undertake such an endeavour. He adds, Private industry is interested as they see future profit and possibilities of branding... Elon and Jeff are very successful entrepreneurs and also bold visionaries. Chatterjee believes that when Mars is eventually colonised, it will be a multi-nation endeavour due to its huge cost and geopolitical considerations. India also qualifies as a partner in this due to its superb space research record, he adds.Meanwhile, one of the latest tweets from @NasaInSight: To the people who got me here, and all the fans who have cheered me on, this ones [a picture of Mars terrain] for you! Now lets catch our breath before the deep science begins.Colony capersMars does not have oxygenBut it does have water from which certain bacteria and algae could release oxygenMars has very low temperaturesBut greenhouse gases such as per flurocarbon (PFC) and CO2 could create a blanket around the planet to warm it upMars does not have the protective magnetic bubble of Earth, so it is bombarded with particle radiationBut radiation shields can solve this problem though available technology is prohibitively expensiveMars does not have any flowing waterBut it does have water vapour and ice. There are ways to harvest water from them."

So, a huge amount of potatoes reach the market  much more than the demand  and have to be sold off at distress-price levels. In December 2016, the retail prices dropped to a ridiculous Rs 2.50 per kg.Farmers, who incur huge losses, then strike back in February-March, controlling the amount being released to the market. This inadequate supply always leads to a price surge. Potatoes were sold at retail prices of up to Rs 30 a kg in March 2017.The governments move this year, say officials, is likely to stabilise retail prices.The minister for agricultural marketing, Tapan Dasgupta, told TOI: Potato prices rise in January-February and to control the surge, we have decided to extend the storage facility by another month to maintain a price balance.Though the state production of 8.5 million tonnes this year is higher than the annual requirement of 6.5 million tonnes, poor supply management keeps prices high at the beginning of the year. In the last three years, we have produced a huge quantity of potatoes, but we noticed that before the new produce hits the market in February, there is a shortage of supply. For the last two years, we have been trying to develop an effective demandsupply management system so that the price remains stable. This year, we hope to keep the price under control, Dasgupta said.Asked about this, agriculture minister Ashis Banerjee said: We still have 11.5 lakh metric tonnes of potato in the cold stores and that is enough for three months. If we can manage the supply effectively people will not face any problem. Asked about the maintenance of the cold stores, Banerjee said: They will have enough time.The state government still has a spot of bother  the huge difference between the retail and wholesale prices. When the Jyoti variety of potato is sold at a wholesale price of Rs 7 per kg, it hits the market at Rs 16 to Rs 18 per kg.It is true that we are getting good prices but the middleman are pushing up retail price. There are no checks and balances. This has created a gap between the wholesale and retail prices, Tapan Samanta, a farmer who has been cultivating potatoes for the last 40 years, said. When asked about it, Dasgupta said: We will control retail prices also but before that we need to ensure that farmers get their due and the supply line is fine."

This included nearly 3,000 hectares of coffee plantation, 1,500 hectares of vegetables such as carrot, beans, garlic and peas, 1,000 hectares of hill banana and 1,000 hectares of potato and nearly 300 hectares of pepper vines.Deputy director (in-charge) of horticulture for Kodaikanal, K Narayanasamy said that this was apart from the nearly 1,500 hectares (3,706 acres) horticultural produce such as coffee, banana, pepper and vegetables destroyed in the plains  especially at Adalur and Pandrimalai that come under Dindigul region.Horticulture department officials said the final stage of data entry is being done and the work would be completed by this weekend. A sum of Rs 500 has been fixed as compensation to clear a tree. Officials said that farmers cultivating vegetables and banana on dry land dependent on rains would get Rs 7,410 per hectare and those irrigating their fields would get Rs 13,500 per hectare.Farmers with smaller landholding will get a minimum compensation of Rs 1,000 and the maximum compensation per farmer is Rs 36,000 even if the farm holding is manifold bigger. Perennial crops such as coffee and pepper will get a compensation of Rs 18,000 per hectare, where the minimum compensation will be Rs 2,000 per farmer. Maximum compensation has been fixed at Rs 36,000.Officials said that heavy rains close to 150mm and 200mm that lashed the hills when the cyclone crossed the region caused landslides badly damaging terrace cultivation on nearly 125 acres. On Tuesday, assessment of terrace cultivation due to landslides in Upper Kodaikanal Hills will be undertaken by a team comprising officials from all government departments. Efforts will be taken to compensate or help affected farmers rebuild it, he added.Farmers have strongly criticized the compensation, saying that it would not even make up the seed cost for plantation. Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) state secretary V Asokan said that vegetables are mostly grown in the upper hill where most farmers own as small as 50 cents to four acres. We need 300kg garlic seed per acre (750kg per hectare) at Rs 200 per kg, he said. He also pointed out that the seed input cost per hectare is Rs 1.5 lakh whereas compensation announced by the government is just 9% (Rs 13,500)."

Dont ask, says 25-year-old Neil DSilva about the four mindless tattoos that seem to have materialized on his athletic body when it used to be frail. Etched during a blurry four years full of rave parties, white powders, needles and desperate trips to Goa, the permanent tattoos remind this cheery Kandivli man about the time he became, in his own words, a disgrace to his unsuspecting parents. Im going to have the tattoos erased as soon as I start earning. Not on my parents money, says D'Silva, clearly regretful of the debt he has piled up during his journey from former drug addict to obsessive triathlon addict whose slew of Ironman medals now not only inspires his social media followers but also school kids who sometimes ask him all the wrong details.Right now, DSilva is telling us his story with his legs wrapped inside a black contraption that hisses from time to time as it cools his muscles. He is seated on the bed in his room that could pass for a fitness studio. It packs a sponsored treadmill, two bicycles that cost a few fixed deposits, a smart trainer that simulates (or as DSilva says stimulates) various cycling terrains virtually and three frames on his bedside wall--a gift from his best friend--that each show an animated man swimming, cycling and running: the three components of a triathlon. Every now and then, the door to DSilvas room opens and in comes either his father with fresh pineapple juice or his mother with a plateful of boiled sweet potatoes for the obsessive inhouse athlete who has completed four overseas Half Ironman events so far. His most recent medal came this October from Ironman 70.3 in Turkey which he finished in good time for someone who started training two years ago: four hours and 39 minutes.Lean and tall, the 25-year-old seems to bear no resemblance to the chubby boy who smiles from a picture taken during his teens. That boy had deflated very quickly after finishing twelfth grade when, as a commerce student, DSilva found himself in the company of a bunch of older boys who experimented with cocaine and other mind-altering drugs. DSilva--whose Facebook post describes his life as fun, even heady recalls: I wasted four years of my life. He cant forget the morning he stumbled back home after one of his many desperate trips to Goa as a broke teenager. Thats when his father, Nixon, smelt the addict in him. Till then, we were too innocent to even suspect him of being an addict, says his mother Leena, a banker and cancer survivor who described the knowledge of her sons addiction as more shocking and heartbreaking than the time she was diagnosed with the terminal disease. My husband was my pillar. He said he had full faith that our boy would mend his ways, she says about Nixon who immediately dragged his son to Fr Joe Pereira of Kripa Foundation, the rehab centre in which DSilva spent two months.Clarity arrived on March 6, 2015, right in the middle of a rave party in a friends house. Thats when I realised I was losing the plot again and decided to quit overnight, says DSilva, a gym rat who took to his passion for running with a vengeance after that epiphany. Soon, another overnight decision saw DSilva giving up cigarettes too after a family friend, Godfrey DeBrito, told him casually that his pace would improve if he gave up smoking. I used to smoke a packet and a half a day, says DSilva, who saw his running time improve by 30 minutes in the span of two years. Now addicted to the runners high, he participated in various half marathons. Ironman--a triathlon whose social media buzz began to infect India two years ago--then gave DSilva a goal and soon, he was making trips to public and private swimming pools near Kandivli.Keen to fuel the expensive dream of their son,the senior DSilvas burnt their fixed deposits into equipment. In return, DSilva would wake up at 5 am daily to run and even go on weekly cycling trips to Lonavla under the careful watch of his friends Aditya or Neeraj. He now plans to prepare young athletes for Asian Games of 2022."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.NEW DELHI: When the poll results came in on Tuesday, one thing was clear: BJP had taken a hit in rural areas. And this despite the Centre allocating large sums for several schemes to boost farmer incomes. So what went wrong? TOI takes a look at the stress points hurting the sector.Two successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain. Drought in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have also added to farmers woes.Prices have collapsed for farm commodities. Low international prices have meant exports have been hit while imports have hurt prices at home. For example, there was a bumper production of pulses in 2016-17 but imports of nearly 6.6 million tonnes arrived, compounding the problem. In 2017-18, another 5.6 million tonnes flowed in, depressing domestic prices further. The government delayed imposing tariffs on imports, which heightened the problem of prices for farmers. According to a Niti Aayog paper, on average, farmers do not realise remunerative prices due to limited reach of the minimum support prices (MSP) and an agricultural marketing system that delivers only a small fraction of the final price to the actual farmer.The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to provide insurance and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of any crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It was also meant to stabilise the income of farmers and ensure they remain in farming. But the scheme has seen lower enrolments due to a string of factors, including high premiums and lack of innovation by insurance firms.Irrigation is crucial for the farm sector, where large tracts of land still depend on monsoon rains. The Centre launched the Rs 40,000-crore Long-Term Irrigation Fund, operated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Under this programme, 99 large irrigation projects were to be completed by December 2019 but the progress so far has been limited. Experts say a number of factors, including bureaucratic delays and slow implementation by states, have hurt progress for this crucial input.According to a Niti Aayog document, farm sector development has ignored the potential of marketing. Archaic laws still hobble the sector. Access of farmers to well-developed markets remains an issue although several initiatives have been launched to develop an electronic market place. Reforms to the APMC Act have been slow and most states have dragged their feet on it. Experts suggest an entity such as the GST Council to bring together states and the Centre to jointly take decisions to reform the sector and provide better access to markets for farmers. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the combination of market regulations and infrastructure deficiencies leads to a price depressing effect on the sector.Introduction of latest technology has been limited due to a number of reasons. Access to modern technology could act as a boost to productivity through improved variety of seeds, farm implements and farming technology. According to a Niti Aayog paper, there has been no real technological breakthrough in recent times.Large gaps in storage, cold chains and limited connectivity have added to the woes of farmers. It has also added to the significant post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables, estimated at 4% to 16% of the total output, according to the OECD.This has meant that there is little incentives for farmers to diversify. According to an OECD document, share of high-value sectors in food processing is low with fruit, vegetable and meat products accounting for 5% and 8% of the total value of output compared to cerealbased products at 21% and oilseeds at 18%A government-appointed panel had recommended that FCI hand over all procurement operations of wheat, paddy and rice to states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard and have created reasonable infrastructure for procurement. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh. It had suggested a complete overhaul of FCI and recommended that farmers be given direct cash subsidy (of about Rs 7000/ha) and fertiliser sector deregulated. The panel had said direct cash subsidy to farmers will go a long way to help those who take loans from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates to buy fertilisers or other inputs, thus relieving some distress in the agrarian sector. The report has been put in cold storage.The share of the farm sector in GDP has declined from 29% in 1990 to about 17% in 2016, but it remains a major source of employment. According to OECD data, 85% of operational land holdings are less than 2 hectares and account for 45% of the total cropped area. Only 5% of farmers work on land holding larger than 4 hectares, according to the Agricultural Census, 2016. Productivity lags other Asian economies such as China, Vietnam and Thailand and average yields are low compared to other global producers. Wheat and rice yields are nearly 3 times lower than world yields while those for mango, banana, onion or potato are between 2 and 7 times lower than the highest yields achieved globally, according to the OECD."

It wasnt blood. But Bandu Markad said it wasnt any different for him. The farmer was in distress and he had just squished the pomegranates that he had grown under tremendous hardships, which included getting water in the drought-prone district.Markad had reason to curse his luck. When he took the yield from his 1,200 trees to the market, he got a price of Rs 10 per kilo. Days ago, it was Rs 80. A video of Markad in tears and beating pomegranates to pulp soon went viral. Moved, people sent him money. At the end of five days, he had about Rs 2 lakh in his account.One could call Markad fortunate. But across the country, a range of issues from debt to low prices for their produce have forced farmers to take desperate measures. Many killed themselves, destroying the lives they left behind. A month after BJPs Devendra Fadnavis took over as CM of Maharashtra in 2014, he said tackling the agrarian crisis would be his top priority. He drafted a special action plan to check suicides in 14 of the worst-hit districts. In 2017, 2,917 suicides were reported, while in the current year, up to October 31, 2,223 farmers have ended their lives.On March 12 this year, thousands of farmers from Maharashtra reached Mumbai after covering 180 km on foot to highlight their plight. On November 30, those in north and central India trooped into Delhi  among them prominent leaders from Opposition parties, indicating the significance the issue has acquired on the national political stage  to articulate their anguish.In the sullen crowd were men like Mohanlal Nagda of Rewli-Devli village in Neemuch district of MP.Nagda had for long avoided looking at the big pile of onions rotting away in a corner of his farm. It invariably brought tears to his eyes. Harvested on his 2-acre land, all 100 quintals of his onion yield now lies dumped. He knows he wont recover the cost if he tries to sell it.The mandi is only 10km away. But Id rather not take my produce there, he said. He quickly did the math. The onions are harvested, but to cut them I must spend Rs 15,000 at Rs 150 per quintal. Transporting it to the mandi will cost Rs 2,500 more at Rs 500 per trolley. I need to spend another Rs 1,500 on loading, unloading and mandi expenses, Nagda told TOI. At Rs 2 per kg, all Id get is Rs 20,000. So, I preferred dumping them, however much it hurts. I spent around Rs 40,000 on cultivation alone. The produce is already decaying. It terrifies me.Maharashtra has declared drought in 151 talukas across 26 districts in the wake of a deficient monsoon. The dry spell has affected an estimated 60% of the 1.6 crore farmers in the state. Due to below average rainfall during sowing season, the output has been hit too. Several areas reported over 70% crop loss and the state sought relief of Rs 7,962 crore from the Centre.But respite looks remote for large chunks. A Nashik farmer recently sent a money order of Rs 1,064 to the PMs office. It was what hed got after selling 750 kg of onion after a crash in prices. It doesnt help that Maharashtra  like many other states  hasnt been able to break cartelisation by wholesale traders and middlemen in market yards to ensure fair pricing. Even implementation of minimum support price (MSP) has not been achieved by the state. Moreover, farmers across India are forced to sell their produce at low rates because the infrastructure to store and process it is lacking.Acting on a report that finances, lack of assistance for healthcare and poor crop output were among the reasons for farm distress, Fadnavis proposed last year that agricultural loans should be waived and farmers can avail fresh aid from financial institutions. In June 2017, the CM announced a loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers; loans amounting to Rs 32,000 crore were to be waived. So far, loans worth Rs 17,000 crore owed by 40 lakh farmers have been waived, while Rs 25,000 crore has been sanctioned for 50 lakh farmers as fresh aid. A raft of schemes has also been drafted to tackle agrarian distress, but implementation is slow owing to lack of coordination and supervision at different levels.Far away in Punjab, farmers are on the warpath over implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations on fixing of MSP of rabi and kharif crops. They also want a complete farm loan waiver, not the partial one okayed by the Amarinder Singh government.Seven farm organisations in Punjab have decided to raise both issues and hold protests on December 18. The organisations have decided on round-the-clock protests outside banks from January 1 to January 5. These groups had earlier stopped the supply of milk and vegetables to urban areas in the state, leading to clashes with milkmen and a lot of produce literally going down the drain.Its a similar story but a different crop in UP. Owing to a bumper harvest this year, potato farmers say they are ruined as the price per 50kg sack has fallen to as low as Rs 20. Cold storages are full of unsold potato. Rakesh Kumar, owner of Mangla Mata cold storage in Badaun, said, Storages in the region have a total capacity of 30 lakh sacks. Of these, 20% are potatoes, but no farmer is coming to fetch them right now because of falling prices. I have already thrown 7,000 sacks while 10,000 more are still here. Selling the produce at villages for Rs 20 per 50 kg sack does not even recover the cost of transportation.Mahendra Swaroop, state president, Cold Storage Association, UP, said, Huge quantities of potato are stuck. District magistrates do not let us dump our produce anywhere as it stinks badly. Haalat kharab ho gayi sab ki."

He was intervening on the reply given by rural development minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, to a call to attention notice raised by MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala. Amarinder said the state had already raised with the Centre the demand for allowing export of potatoes and sugar to Russia, UAE, Iran and Sri Lanka for fetching better prices of these crops. He said that once the Centre gives clearance to the state government for export of these crops, the farmers would immensely benefit in terms of lucrative returns and assured marketability of their produce."
148,Deconstructing tradition and tiramisu,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/deconstructing-tradition-and-tiramisu/article25748364.ece,2018-12-15,The Hindu,"I may not be a great one for tradition, but there is one practice that I follow  and very eagerly at that. Every year, sometime in autumn, our two friends take us out to dinner to a place that they recommend, or one that we want to go to. This time we were late in keeping our date  thanks to my own preoccupations. But then, a few nights ago, we met at a restaurant they suggested  Tres in the Lodhi Colony Market  and had a good time together.Tres opened up some years ago and there was a time when everyone was talking about it. But this and that happened, and somehow I never went there. I was disappointed when I heard that it had shut down. Then, some weeks ago, it opened again  much to my joy.It is a cosy place, with the right kind of lights, though perhaps not the right kind of chairs. Their servers are cheerful and eager to help. The prices are on the higher side (a meal for two should cost about Rs. 3,000) but the menu is interesting. For starters, we asked for king prawn and kalamari with radish cucumber salad, smoked duck breast with peppered barley kimchi and Josper-baked Camembert with red grape and pepper preserve and grilled sourdough.For mains, our friends had the tenderloin steak with a baked potato mash, wilted greens and sauted mushroom, my wife asked for the pork belly (from the small plates section) and I, the crispy skin salmon fillet. For dessert, there was tiramisu.The starters were superb. I am not allowed to eat much cheese, but Camembert is one of my favourites, so I had a bit of that, and sang that old Hindi film song, Tu cheez badi hai mast mast to myself. A Josper oven is a grill-cum-oven, and helps professional chefs control temperatures to a t. The cheese was just right, I thought  neither too melty, nor too hard. The red grape and pepper preserve added to the taste, as did the grilled sourdough.Crunchy and tangyThe prawns and calamari were crunchy and tangy, and had been tossed with a lime chilli drizzle. I liked the smoked duck breast, too. The salty taste was balanced by a ginger plum gel and herbed salad.My salmon fillet with a crispy skin was excellent. It came with dill risotto and charred morning glory, but I concentrated solely on the fish. The fish had been cooked just right  so it was neither flaky, nor rubbery. The pork belly, I am told, was delicious. I am not allowed red meat yet (I am still trying to convince my doctors that in some quarters, pork is not considered red) so I could only look at it with sad eyes. It was served with a vegetable marmalade, which complemented the taste of the pork belly while the pickled mustard seeds gave it a nice and sweet kick (or so I was told).What was really disappointing was the tenderloin that my two friends were so looking forward to. They wanted the steak medium rare, but it was pretty tough and they had to struggle with their steak knives. I tried a piece and found it much too chewy. To top it, they charged extra for the truffle oil that the steak came with. That, I thought, was rather mean.The deconstructed tiramisu  mascarpone mousse, Kahlua jelly, coffee soaked savoiardi sponge and chocolate crisps  was okay. I am not much into tiramisus, and I would have preferred it constructed rather than deconstructed.But on the plus side, we were together, and I was dining out after a while. The steak apart, it was a nice meal, and it was good to be with close friends. There is something to be said about tradition, after all."

Earlier, it was confined to Rohtas and Kaimur, but the farmers of Patna and Nalanda districts have also started stubble burning, which must be stopped at all costs, the CM said after inspecting the contract potato farming model by women self-help groups at Sonbarsa in East Champaran.The CM asked Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project CEO Balamurugan D to take Jeevika didis help in creating awareness against stubble burning.Speaking at Mahavir-Rameshwar Inter College in Harsiddhi, the CM said the state government had already decided to open an engineering college in each district and paramedical colleges and polytechnic colleges in each sub-divisional headquarters for imparting technical education to the deprived sections of society.He said the government under him opened 22,000 new schools in remote villages but 12.5% children were still out of the education system and most of them belonged to the unprivileged sections.He recounted how his government schemes like poshak and cycle yojana, student credit card and scholarship initiatives minimized the dropout rate of girls students in schools.Earlier, the CM unveiled two busts of late Rameshwar Mahto and Mahavir Prasad on the Mahavir-Rameshwar Inter College in Harsiddhi. While Rameshwar was the father of former minister Awadhesh Prasad Kushwaha, Mahavir was the father of district BJP chief Rajendra Prasad Gupta. Nitish also inaugurated the first digital panchayat of the district and a panchayat bhawan in Sonbarsa.Ministers Pramod Kumar, Rana Randhir Singh and Vinod Narayan Jha were also present on the occasion."
150,Turn of Punjab's potatoÂ farmers to loseÂ sleep over low prices,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/17/after-maharashtra-punjab-farmers-losing-sleep-over-low-prices-1912613.html,2018-12-17,The New Indian Express,"Harpreet Bajwa ByExpress News ServiceCHANDIGARH: Not just onion farmers in Maharashtra, but also those in Punjab, growing potato, too are staring at a bleak future as prices of the crop have crashed.A potato grower, Pawanjot Singh of Dhogri village near Jalandhar, who tilled 250 acres, said, A farmer spends between Rs 9 and Rs 12 to produce a kg of potato. It includes Rs 6- Rs 8 production cost and Rs 3-Rs 4 for harvesting, packaging, cold storage and transportation. The fresh crop, which has hit the market, is being sold for Rs4 per kg. So we are not being able to recover the production cost. The implementation of GST has also bumped up the costs.More than 90 per cent of the potato crop in the state is grown in the Doaba region, which comprises Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts. Potato is grown on around 85,000 hectares, and it produces 2.2 million tonnes of the crop.Singh said that retailers are earning from the crop, but farmers are failing to recover the production cost. It is estimated that around 10 lakh bags of potatoes from the previous year are lying in 500 cold storages in the state (each bag has 50 kg). Now, they have been given for free as cattle feed, said Singh, who has 12,000 bags lying in his store. He added that as the crop this year has been infected with blight disease the production is expected to fall. Also, farmers are spending Rs 5,000 extra to save the crop.Jang Bahandur Sangha, Secretary General of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers, said, Punjab supplies 75 per cent of shed potato (potato seed) to other states. But most states have already sown their crops. Hence, we suspect that our potato seeds will not be sold and there will be no liquidity with the farmers.Potatoes from India are exported to the Middle East, Sri Lanka and Russia. Exporting potatoes are costly as it involves freight charges. The US and the European Union does not allow potato imports and for last two years Pakistan, too, has banned it, said Sangha. The state government has asked the Centre for permission to export potato to Russia, the USA, Iran and Sri Lanka."
151,"Agrarian crisis dominates, set to influence 2019 general elections",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/19/agrarian-crisis-dominates-set-to-influence-2019-general-elections-1913677.html,2018-12-19,The New Indian Express,"By IANSNEW DELHI: Agrarian crisis emerged as a major political concern in 2018, fuelled mainly by a fall in crop prices and a poor procurement mechanism which will provide opposition parties a common ground to rally against the BJP ahead of the next year's general elections.The anger brewing against the perceived ""anti-farm policies"" of the government could be measured by the poor performance of the BJP in the rural parts of Hindi heartland states in the just-concluded Assembly elections, that saw the BJP ousted from power in all three states.In past one year, the national capital alone saw at least five major rallies of farmers, despite the BJP-government coming up with a new price-fixation formula and a score of schemes to impress the tillers of the soil.The police firing in Madhya Pradesh's Mandsaur last year that led to the death of six farmers, sparked agitations throughout the country over rural distress, which snowballed into a major political and social issue this year. The simmering discontent among farmers gained political traction in 2018.Various opposition parties have been raising their voices against different issues to suit their electoral needs but they showed unanimity in expressing their solidarity with the demands for better crop remuneration and farm loan waivers during the November 30 farmers' rally in the capital.At the same rally, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had said: ""The voice that is reverberating now across the country is of the farmers who are in deep distress and crisis.""For the first time, the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will be fought on issues revolving around rural distress, said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, who is credited with bringing over 200 farmers' outfits under one banner -- the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).""There has always been agrarian distress in the country. However, it never got an occasion to become a principal factor in the elections. The BJP's defeat in the Assembly polls, coupled with the newly-achieved unity among farmers, has ensured that farm distress would take a centre stage in the 2019 elections,"" Yadav told IANS.He termed the BJP regime led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""the most anti-farmer"" government in the history of the independent India because of its ""unsympathetic"" treatment of farmers in the past four-and-a-half years.Many videos throughout the year went viral on the social media, featuring angry farmers throwing their harvest and milk on the roads in the absence of remunerative prices.Amid protests, the government increased the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for certain agriculture commodities. However, the farmers found this not at par with their demands and expectations.Also, poor procurement of commodities owing to inadequate numbers and delay in the opening of purchasing centres by the government agencies forced the farmers to make distress sales.In the case of vegetables, while the retail prices hovered between Rs 20-30 in major cities, the prices received by farmers for semi-perishable commodities such as potatoes and onion slumped to Rs 1 per kg.The Agriculture Ministry seemed ""ineffective"" to create a redressal mechanism, activists said, though it came up with three procurement plans. Notably, Union Minister and Senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari had in June this year acknowledged that there was agrarian crisis due to surplus crop output and sought action to address the problem.And yet, the BJP-government failed to take corrective action by analysing the demand-and-supply situation, said Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader and Lok Sabha member Raju Shetti, who quit BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over farmers issues' last year.""The government has been quite aware of the farmers' issues. However, it did not take required action to ensure remunerative prices for farmers and the procurement of their harvest was ineffective,"" Shetti added.Noted agronomist Ashok Gulati said there was ""lack of understanding"" and ""lack of vision"" in the current BJP regime. He said the government did not carry out the required market reforms but resorted to just slogans and announcements.""Even after the Mandsaur firing episode, the government did not act,"" he said.Any government needs a smart agriculture minister for effective implementation of schemes, he added.Interestingly, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh chose to attend a Yoga session with Baba Ramdev in Bihar two days after the Mandsaur firing."

Whats worse, some of the leftover stock of last year is still lying with them.The farmers claim that they are unable recover even their cost of production and harvesting as the price is down to Rs 3 per kg. When the harvesting of potatoes started, which are supplied directly in the market for domestic consumption, the price was at Rs 20-25 per kg. That was three weeks back, now it has crashed to Rs 3 a kg. While, Jalandhar is largely a seed producingbelt for the country, farmers here also harvest part of their crop for supplies in the local market, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha.Cost of production, harvesting and packing ranges from Rs 6 to 8. With selling price tumbling to Rs 3, and would not be surprising if farmers start ploughing their produce in their fields, said Kulwant Singh of village Qadianwal on the outskirts of Jalandhar.He said that some part of the last year crop meant for supply as seeds was still lying with them. Market for us has just not revived since demonetization. For third year in a row, we are set to fave huge loses, he said.Demonetisation was announced in the days when season for receiving orders was about to start. After the announcement, we received no orders from traders. The entire business was based on cash transactions and our biggest buyer is West Bengal. Even 2015 was also not very good for us, but last two years have been the worst as our buyers from other states were left with little cash, he said.Village Uggi resident Gurdeep Singh said that while he would be harvesting his entire crop in February for supply as seeds to others states but some part of his last year crop was still lying with him.Meanwhile, Sangha said that they had last year demanded that export to Pakistan be opened in the summer. Pakistan does not have cold storage facility and in the summers there potato prices remain high and we could have finished our stocks of previous season by supplying the produce to Pakistan. Now, there would be no benefit as their own fresh crop would flood the market, he said.Since demonetization, there has been no reprieve for potato growers and they are continuing to suffer. We cant give up potato cultivation easily as we have invested on implements and appliances, said Sangha and Kulwant.When contacted, deputy director (horticulture) Satbir Singh confirmed that prices were low.Doaba belt of Punjab mainly produces potato seed for major parts of the country and they did not receive good returns on their produce in the last two years. In these days only a part of the crop is harvested for supplies to local markets and their prices have also come down after the glut in the market, he said."
154,What makes chickens happy?,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/what-makes-chickens-happy/article25793553.ece,2018-12-21,The Hindu,"How do you measure a chickens happiness? Is it in the way it runs for food? How much time it spends preening?To size up what might make chickens happy in their brief lives, researchers at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, are putting 16 breeds through physical fitness and behavioural tests. Theyre watching how well birds scramble over a barrier for food, how skittish they seem and whether they play with a fake worm.Chickens cant say how they feel, but playing with a fake worm may be a sign of happiness.We have to infer when an animal is happy or content or experiencing pleasure based on their behaviour, said Stephanie Torrey, one of the researchers.In recent years, the animal welfare world has moved beyond looking at how to minimise suffering to exploring whether animals can also enjoy their lives, Ms. Torrey said.Such measures may be considered irrelevant by companies but underscore a broader lack of consensus around the welfare of chickens, which are sometimes slaughtered as soon as five weeks after hatching.Animal welfare advocates say cruelty begins with birds that have been bred to have breasts so big they can barely walk. They say todays chickens are genetic monstrosities crippled by pain and that the industry needs to switch breeds.Many in the industry say theres no problem and that chickens may not move around a lot because theyre sedentary. Even if they were to agree to change breeds, its not clear what the alternatives should look like.Couch potatoesThe two sides disagree about the cause and frequency of health issues among broilers chickens.John Glisson of the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association says broiler chickens are couch potatoes and that some people may mistake the birds laziness for a medical issue.He said trying to assess welfare is tricky beyond established industry measures, like whether a chicken dies from disease before its slaughtered.The industry says changing breeds is unnecessary, and that switching to broiler chickens that dont grow as big or as fast would mean using up more water and other resources. Chicken prices at the supermarket would be higher too.The study in Canada will provide important information on what type of chickens might suffer less, said Josh Balk, the Humane Societys vice president of farm animal protection."

The growers are not coming forward to procure the crop from the cold stores due to very low prices and the cold store owners are worried over facing losses. The rent for storing potatoes at the cold stores is normally given at the end of the season in November, which is already over with no trace of potato growers at the cold stores.Nearly 4.5 lakh bags of 50kg each are still stored in the cold stores in Bathinda region, which has 35 cold stores with a capacity to store 30 lakh bags of potatoes. The seasonal rent charged from growers is Rs 100 per bag and nearly 20% is charged as advance and 80% is charged upon completion of season. Of the total produce, 30-35% is stored by traders, who eventually have to pay up to continue dealing with stores. The owners of cold stores aiming to create space in stores for fruits, dry fruits and other items for four months till March are expected to start throwing away the potatoes in a few days if the growers doesnt turn up to pick the produce. The season for storing potatoes is counted from March 1 to October 31, extendable up to November end with mutual understanding.Potato was grown on 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres) in the last season in Bathinda area and 1.65 lakh metric tonne potato was produced. Nearly, 110 quintal of potatoes were grown in one acre. Potatoes are grown till middle of November and the harvesting is done in February end. Potato growers on their part are feeling highly aggrieved and feel they will have to incur losses. They claim that the input cost turns out to be nearly Rs 40,000 per acre whereas the potatoes are fetching only Rs 300 per quintal and the growers have failed to even cover the input cost.Bathinda-based Dhillon cold store owner Iqbal Singh Dhillon said that, Cold store owners are facing imminent losses. A 1 lakh bag capacity store has a running cost of nearly Rs 50 lakh per annum with Rs 35 lakh being spent on electricity. We charge rent from growers at the end of season, which seems doubtful this year due to losses faced by farmers. Another cold store owner Ramesh Kumar said that cold stores will have to incur losses with farmers not picking the produce. We will have to throw it away and face the cost of storing these, he added.Potato grower Jaspal Singh said that, The prices have crashed to Rs 3 per kilogram with which we failed to cover even the input costs. Most of the growers are not going to cold stores to pick the produce.Bathinda deputy director, horticulture , Gurkewal Singh Dhillon confirmed that potato growers were facing losses and due to it potatoes have been grown on over 10% less area as compared to previous year. Most of the growers not even are picking produce from cold stores."

They pour liquor in their spraying machine, mix water and spray it on the crop  which they believe increases the size of the potato considerably and readies the crop in a shorter period of time. According to farmers, liquor works as insecticide on the cane crop. While the agriculture department authorities have denied that alcohol can help in potato production in any way, farmers are gung-ho about it.Lokesh Sharma, a farmer in Bohich village of Bulandshahr, said, One quarter of a country-made liquor bottle is sprayed on potato crop spread in 6 bighas. A quarter costs me Rs 50, and I have 10-acre land  so the cost comes to some Rs 500. This helps in increasing the size of the potato and the crop takes lesser time.However, the quantity of liquor per bigha varies from farmer to farmer.Gyani Singh, a farmer in Jamalpur village of Bulandshahr, said, When I first got to know about it, I was a little apprehensive. So, I tried it as an experiment in my field, I sprayed liquor on one bigha land and used fertilisers and insecticides on the remaining five bighas. I saw that the potatoes on which liquor was sprayed were bigger in size and grew in a shorter span in comparison with the potatoes on which liquor was not sprayed. That is when I was assured of liquor spray on the potato crop.Singh uses two quarter bottles of liquor on one bigha of land mixed with 10 litres of water.In Bijnor, liquor is being used as an alternative for costly pesticides.Dharmendra Singh, a farmer in Mandawar town, said, I have been spraying liquor on my sugarcane crop for the past some years and have found that it has a positive impact on the crop. Alcohol protects the crop from bacterial and fungal diseases.Bijnor is an agriculture-rich district. There is over 2.2 lakh hectare of sugarcane cultivation area while 6,000 hectares are under potato cultivation in the district.Agriculture scientists and officials have dismissed the farmers claims and have even warned them of the liquors harmful effects on the soil. Bulandshahr district agriculture officer Ashwani Kumar Singh said, There is no scientific research to support the claim a crop grows better if alcohol is sprayed on it. Farmers are unnecessarily wasting their money on liquor which in turn might harm the soil quality. I have asked the horticulture officer to look into the matter and spread awareness among farmers.Horticulturists have said that alcohol evaporates in 10 minutes and there is no scientific basis to believe that it will have any impact on the crop yield or its duration.Nonetheless, use of alcohol as a crop yield enhancer and an alternative for costly pesticides has been popular in various parts of Maharashtra where pests often cause considerable damage to crops. In parts of Haryana too, farmers have used liquor on brinjal crop for years."

These officials are trying to project the crop insurance scheme as the Centre's contribution. I vouch that this is a travesty of truth,"" she said. ""The Centre is trying to showcase the scheme as its own when it pays only 20% of the liability while the state bears 80%. I am telling AIC officials the state will withdraw its deposits with AIC if they continue with such misinformation. We can very well bear entire liability if we can pay 80% of insurance premium,"" she said.State officials pointed out that Bengal was the only state where farmers didn't have to pay crop insurance for rabi crops other than potato and onion . The state government pays its own share and also the beneficiary's share, which adds up to 80% of the insurance premium.The Centre uses the PMFBY tag by paying only 20% of the premium share. According to state officials, the CM has introduced a crop insurance scheme called Bangla Fasal Bima which is aimed at covering rabi crops, with the state bearing the entire cost of the premium. ""Now, when the CM has mentioned it, beneficiaries under PMFBY are likely to be transferred to the Bangla Fasal Bima scheme,"" a state official said.The CM also listed government bounties in the agricultural sector. ""We have abolished 'khajna' (land rent) on agricultural land. The owner of agricultural land doesn't have to pay a mutation fee to get it registered.

While speaking during the one-day winter session of Haryana assembly, the CM also announced to include raw potato in the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana (price difference compensation scheme) from Friday onward.With the announcement of hike of Rs 10 per quintal in the sugarcane prices on Thursday, Haryana has become the first state in the country to increase state advisory price (SAP) for the crop this year as none of the other states had done that so far. Haryana is giving highest price in the country of sugarcane to the growers, the CM claimed.Khattar said that girdawari was being conducted in the state to assess the damage to crop due to hailstorm in different parts of Haryana this month. Compensation on account of damage to crop due to fire had been distributed by the respective deputy commissioners. Letters have been written to all the DCs directing them to give details of the remaining such cases so that compensation could be disbursed to those left out, he added.To remove shortcomings in the girdawari conducted manually by the department concerned and enhance accuracy to assess the damage to crops due to water logging, rain, and hailstorms, it had now been decided to set up an online portal, Khattar said. A farmer would have to give details concerning his crop and area under cultivation on this portal, which would be double checked by agriculture and farmers welfare department and revenue department so that he did not face any problem while getting claims from insurance companies and banks, the CM said.While referring to the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana, the chief minister said that potato, tomato, cauliflower and onion were now being covered. If any farmers got price less than the minimum support price for these crops, the state government would cover the price deficit for farmers, he said, adding that 18,000 farmers cultivating 48,000 acres had so far register themselves. He said that besides the government and the concerned departments, it was also the duty of MLAs, even of the opposition parties, to make the farmers aware in their respective areas of these schemes so that maximum people could benefit.Soft loans from cooperative banks were being provided to farmers on 0% interest rate, the CM said. Apart from this, compensation amounting to about Rs 890 crore had been distributed to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojanaduring the last three years in Haryana, of which Rs 229 crore had been given to farmers of Sirsa alone."
