0,F Bar (World cuisine),http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tastingtimes/f-bar-world-cuisine/,2013-01-04,The Times Of India,"It is the first Friday of 2013 and I begin by quoting an old saying, When Mohammed does not go to the mountain, the mountain comes to Mohammed. And thats my wish for you for 2013 may your mountain of desires come easily and swiftly to you. As if by sheer serendipity, my guests today seem to specialise in doing this. The charming global gourmet couple Bela and Micky Dalal (long time fans of the sublime Swiss Spruengli chocolates) are now making sure that these exquisite handmade chocolate creations are available to us in India for exclusive caterings and customised gift boxes too.Their dapper son, Rohan Dalal (co founder of the unique Doorbell pharmacy) provides customers with a unique, convenient and efficient way of tracking and ordering their monthly medicine and fitness supplement requirements.The Dalal family (including their son Jay, economics major, DJ by passion currently rocking NYC) has dined at Vineet Bhatias restaurants (in Switzerland and Mumbai), and couple of months ago, I had an amazing meal in Londons Rasoi (Vineet Bhatias Michelin starred restaurant). And after Azok, Ziya in Mumbai, Bhatias food is served in F Bar too.AmbianceMumbais very own F Bar sashays in (of all places), into the citys latest high-rise in a business district. It has it all Fashion TV, 10,000 sq ft sprawling restaurant, dance floor, terrace and Vineet Bhatias food too. That it chooses to locate itself in the somewhat inaccessible location on the third floor of the One IndiaBulls Centre (Lower Parel,) doesnt seem to be a deterrent for Mumbais clubbers. But does it make for a destination for the diner?Be prepared for a long walk through the gleaming lobby and corridors of IndiaBulls Centre and into a dark, twin-levelled space with mesmerising images of the FTV channel on four large walls. Both, the bar and restaurant, share a theatrical black ceiling and upper wooden ceiling that rolls like a wave. God help women with heels who go up the steep stairwell (to the restaurant). No matter which table you sit at in the square-shaped restaurant area, the Fashion TV images are visible.FoodVineet Bhatias starters, flavoursome and generously portioned Tandoori Wasabi Curry Leaf Prawns, Tawa Rosemary Seekh Kebab and the unusual Peanut Butter Chicken delight. Bhatias Fashion Bites, Saucy Bowls, Naaninis and Pizzans, strut the menu. It is the Tawa Ravas, stylishly served in a spoon and made delightful with the tequila glaze, that we all recommend. As we do the robustly spiced, succulent Patiala Chicken with Whisky Flamb. Worth trying too are the strange-sounding Naaninis (naans like paninis served with curly fries, are stuffed with Chettinad Potatoes and crisp Urad Dal). Interestingly, the other strange-sounding dish of Pizaans (naans topped and prepared like pizzas) layered with Paneer Makhni and the other with Rogan Josh-smoked Cashew Nut Pizzan (with soft bases) good too.Minus PointsThe regular pizza (not Vineets) is too hard and is smothered in a sweet sauce. While Wasabi Curry Leaf Prawns are good, they are overcooked, ditto for the Papillote Fish with Olives Capers. Maa Dal is too tomatoey and Baby Corn Asparagus, too tough. The desserts look better than they taste, be it the Rasmalai Mango Lasagne, Blue Curacao Rabadi or the sugar-free Apple Cinnamon Kheer, Granola, or the Guava Kulfi. Avoidable Coconut Panna Cotta, Bubblegum Jelly and Paan Laddoo. And the price points are high (Rs 5000 meal for two).My PointTo check out its nightclub avatar, I had popped in here on an earlier Saturday night (with my young rocking buddies Jivesh Bhojwani and Anandita De) to find long lines of clubbers waiting to get in and the place throbbing to the DJs commercial music. But for dining, the space is too dark and at night, the music can get obtrusive. However, for those in the area and those looking for an interesting twist to Indian fare (served through the day), F Bar is the answer.FoodlineI am feeling like a kulfi here in freezing Delhi but your messages are warming me.

1,"Chill to bring warmth to farm output, may cool inflation",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Chill-to-bring-warmth-to-farm-output-may-cool-inflation/articleshow/17881330.cms,2013-01-04,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA/NEW DELHI/AHMEDABAD: The icy winter in north India, along with morning dew and sunny conditions in rural areas, have sown the seeds for bumper harvests, which will cool food prices that had galloped after erratic monsoon rains hurt farm output last year.Consumers are already seeing a downward trend in prices of potato, wheat and pulses. Potato prices had soared 91% from March to November while wheat climbed 18% and pulses 22% since the start of the fiscal year. Vegetable prices have been falling since September while wheat has dropped 7% in two months, and analysts say more good news will follow.Economists say food prices are no longer a worry for India's overall wholesale inflation.Wholesale inflation has remained stubbornly high and prompted the central bank to delay the long-awaited cut in interest rates. Inflation in November was 7.24%. Food inflation, which has a 14.3% weight in the index, was 8.5% as wheat prices were up 24% annually while potato had jumped 72%.Expectations of good harvests and favourable international market conditions have boosted supply and reduced prices of cooking oil. ""The mustard crop is expected to be good this year. And there is enough availability of oil in international markets like Malaysia and Indonesia. So, we do not see any impact of edible oil on food inflation numbers,"" said Sandeep Bajoria, CEO of Sunvin Group, a consultancy firm in oil and oilseeds.Crude palmoil prices have dropped to $800 per tonne from $1,200 per tonne last March and soyabean oil prices have also ebbed. Favourable weather conditions and higher acreage are expected to boost mustard output and lead to a further fall in cooking oil prices, trade officials said. ""If weather remains favourable till January, we are likely to get an output of 6.5 million tonnes as against 5.5 million tonnes last year. This will put pressure on prices, which have already been dragged by weak palmoil prices,"" said BV Mehta, executive director, Solvent Extractors' Association, an industry body.Crop prospects have brightened in cold and sunny Rajasthan, which harvests 40% of the mustard grown in India. ""Dip in temperature, morning dew and sunshine are good conditions for mustard crop. The sowing is progressing well and the total mustard acreage is likely to cross 34 lakh hectares as against 25 lakh hectares last year. Sowing will continue till early January,"" said DD Jain, joint secretary, Rajasthan Oil Industries Association.Favourable weather has also pushed up chana acreage and helped prices come down to Rs 3,600 per quintal from Rs 5,000 last October. Planting has gone up in the two major producers, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. ""Chana prices had come down significantly from the second half of December. There will be pressure on prices as arrivals will begin from next week,"" said Vedika Narvekar, senior research analyst, Angel Commodities.Pravin Dongre, president, Indian Pulses and Grains Association, said: ""Prices have crashed in the country with increasing imports of chana from Australia. Chana imports are expected to be around 4 lakh tonnes this year compared with 1 lakh tonnes earlier."" The dip in temperature and morning dew are also likely to help production of wheat, one of the staple ingredients in the country's food basket. ""The weather is perfect for bountiful harvest. If conditions prevail for a month, yield will be higher than last year's record produce of 93 million tonnes,"" said Indu Sharma, director of Karnal-based Directorate of Wheat Research.According to latest data, wheat sowing lags behind last year's pace covering 272.79 lakh hectares - down by 4 lakh hectares. ""Stage looks perfect. The situation can be better if the sun shines through the prevailing foggy weather,"" said RS Sharma, a senior agri-scientist. Economists feel that better rabi crops will have an impact on food inflation numbers in December and January. ""We do not see a sudden spike in food inflation numbers. It may go down a little bit compared with November,"" said Indranil Pan, chief economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank.India's headline annual inflation rate, based on the monthly Wholesale Price Index (WPI), had declined to 7.24% for November 2012 compared with 7.45% for the previous month and 9.46%. Prices of potato, the staple vegetable in Indian households and a major contributor to food inflation, are likely to remain on the lower side this winter. Current prices in the wholesale market are in the range of Rs 3.60-4.20 a kg. In retail, prices are in the range of Rs 5-12 a kg. Traders expect further correction in the coming days when harvesting is in full swing.""Once the demand from North-East India is covered, prices in the domestic market will fall by 50 paise a kg,"" says Jawahar Lal Dhall of Shri Bhagwati Trader in Jalandhar mandi of Punjab. The daily arrival of potato (largely Pukharaj variety) in the mandi was over 4,000 quintal.Traders from Punjab have been dispatching potato crop to West Bengal and Assam through rail rakes on alternate days. Potato acreage in West Bengal, the second largest producer, has gone up 5% to 4 lakh hectares. ""The weather is favourable for the crop and we are hoping for good numbers this season,"" said Patit Paban De, member, West Bengal Cold Storage Association."
2,Farmers plan massive stir for fair price,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-plan-massive-stir-for-fair-price/article4288762.ece,2013-01-09,The Hindu,"Issuing a warning to the Government on rising input costs and denial of remunerative costs to farmers for their produce, Bhartiya Kisan Union on Tuesday announced a country-wide agitation. Unless we are given a fair remunerative price for our produce, we will drop production, warned the leaders at a Press conference here.These steps are urgently needed to stop farmers from committing suicide and live a dignified life, they added.Noting that the Government did not consult any grassroots farmers organisation in the pre-Budget meetings, farm leaders Ajmer Singh Lakhowal, Rakesh Tikait and Yudhvir Singh said the consultations were eyewash as no real farmers organisations were invited to these meetings.Mr. Lakhowal said last year Punjab farmers spent Rs. 300 crore on fertilizers, Rs.800 crore on diesel and Rs. 1,500 crore on buying electricity to irrigate their crop. Yet the panel for Agriculture Costs and Prices initially recommended that the minimum support price for wheat be frozen at last years level. It is only after farmers protested that a hike of Rs. 65 per quintal was given. We want crop prices to be fixed as per the recommendations of the Hooda Committee report as well as the National Farmers Commission, which says that farmers should receive 50 per cent above the cost of cultivation.Asked whether this will not raise the prices for consumers, the leaders said farmers and consumers would have to jointly launch a movement. There is a need to change the mind-set. Consumers do not mind buying chocolate worth Rs. 100 or electronic toys worth Rs. 1,000, but resent paying an additional Rs. 5 or Rs.10 for essential commodities. Farmers are not benefiting from the price rise of essential commodities. A farmer, for instance, gets Rs. 1.50 per kg for potato, which, by the time it reaches the city, is sold for Rs. 20 per kg. And the high cost of potato chips, etc., is not shared with farmers. It is the industry and middlemen that benefit, said Mr. Tikait.They said FDI in multi-brand retail will not benefit farmers as is being projected. It will only benefit traders. Small middlemen will be replaced by bigger middle-men.Bemoaning lack of farm labour, they said the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme was a conspiracy to make the workforce redundant for the farm sector so that fewer and fewer people remained in the agriculture sector. As in European countries, the Government should directly give to farmers the difference between cost of production and price at which the produce is sold in the market. Only then will farmers receive a fair price, said Mr. Yudhvir Singh.Joint movement of farmers and consumers will help, they sayWe want crop prices fixed as per Hooda panel suggestions"
3,Intense cold boon for farmers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Intense-cold-boon-for-farmers/articleshow/17947961.cms,2013-01-09,The Times Of India,"PATNA: While intense cold conditions continue to trouble people in Patna and other parts of the state, it is a boon for farmers who have sowed Rabi crops during winter season. In fact, a little rainfall in this season will only add to a better harvest of Rabi crops. But, experts feel, if the temperature plummets further, it will create snowfall which will be bad for all the crops which are on the verge of producing good results.Deputy director of agriculture department (Information) Abhanshu C Jain said this weather is not only good for Rabi crops but even potatoes and pulses that are currently in fields flourish in low temperature. ""The temperature is not very low at the moment and it is, in general, good for Rabi crops such as wheat and maize that are sowed during winter season. A little rainfall along with latest irrigation techniques will give further boost to the crop results,"" he said.Organic vegetable growers too are happy with the spell of cold wave the state is experiencing. ""Right now we have planted organic potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, cabbage and tomatoes, and cold conditions are favourable for better yields. But rainfall may be harmful for these veggies,"" Nalanda Organic Grower Federation (NOVGA) chairman (marketing wing) Rakesh Kumar said.Assistant professor of Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour, Sunil Kumar said, ""If the current temperature level continue for few more days, farmers will certainly reap the benefit. But if the mercury dips further and snowfall starts, all crops will come under the cold.""Meanwhile, current spate of cold wave has hit the vegetable buyers hard. ""While potatoes are available at Rs 50 per 5 kg in the market, onion is being sold at Rs 100 per 5 kg,"" said a local seller at Anta Haat, adding, ""tomatoes are available for Rs 16, brinjals range between Rs 10-12 per kg, cauliflower for Rs 16 per kg and peas for a whopping Rs 24 per kg."" Even during peak season the rates of peas are very high. In the retail market, veggies are sold for an even higher rate, adding to the woes of Patnaites."
4,Eating gets costlier as food prices skyrocket,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Eating-gets-costlier-as-food-prices-skyrocket/articleshow/17991153.cms,2013-01-12,The Times Of India,"MUMBAI: The rising cost of commuting in Mumbai would perhaps be easier to bear had inflation not unleashed a multi-pronged attack on Mumbaikars. In the past year, food prices have risen unabated in the absence of checks by the authorities. Typically, a vast difference is seen between not just wholesale and retail rates but in rates across localities as retailers push up margins to make unregulated profits.Basic items, without which no meal is complete, have dented the budget of the salaried class. Beginning with breakfast items, like bread, eggs and milk, and going on to cooking oil, spices and condiments, each product has hit a new high in the past year.At the peak of winter, when prices are usually at their lowest, common roots like onions and potato are selling at Rs 18 to 20 per kg. So are tomatoes. The average price for all three is Rs 10 to 12 per kg, maybe as low as Rs 8 in a good season. ""Retail rates have doubled, it is true. But, wholesale rates have also risen from Rs 8 to 10 per kg to Rs 12 to 15. Consumers should not mind the hike if farmers are paid a better procurement price,"" says Ashok Walunj, head of the APMC's onion-potato market.A small 400gm loaf of sliced white bread now costs Rs 18, up from Rs 12 to 14 a year ago. ""Given that most households require one loaf a day, the increase translates to Rs 120 per month,"" says Khar resident Sameena Gulrajani. ""The cost of cooking oil is rising by Rs 5 to 7 every few weeks. Until 2009, safflower oil was stable at Rs 72 per litre. It now costs Rs 155, having gone up by Rs 25 in the past year alone. And the Planning Commission says Rs 32 per day is enough to sustain an individual in the city?""The president of the Indian Bakers Association, Khodadad Irani, says, ""The cumulative increase in input costs of maida flour, electricity, transportation and labour has pushed up prices of bread. Instead of branded bread, people are switching to 'ladi pav', which is unregulated in terms of weight and hygiene.""Fakhruddin Shaikh, who runs Raza Oil Depot in Behram Baug, Jogeshwari, says, ""A popular brand of coconut oil has risen from Rs 116 per litre in 2012 to Rs 220 per litre in January 2013. Consumers have no choice but to use less oil and restrict preparing fried foods.""The budget for spices is another casualty. ""Middle-class Lalbaug is paying twice the amount for common red chillis. Prices are up from Rs 100-120 per kg last year to Rs 180-200 this month. Apart from a shortage of arrivals, experts blame speculative trading on the stock market,"" says Sanket Khamkar of Chivda Galli.What upsets the consumer is the authorities' lack of intervention. ""I cannot see a single step that the government is taking to check hoarding, adulteration and price rigging by retailers. Tomatoes are selling for Rs 10 in Jogeshwari market while retailers in Bandra and Andheri are charging Rs 20. The mark-up, even by location, cannot be 100%,"" says Avadhoot Mishra who lives in the western suburbs.Last year, the state had announced a plan to end the monopoly of the APMCs and allow growers to deliver fresh farm produce to Mumbaikars directly. The plan remains in cold storage. ""This scheme will not work in Mumbai,"" declares Walunj. ""Farms are 200km away. How can a grower hire trucks to bring produce to Mumbai? Where will he park his vehicle, who will unload the goods and how will he get paid on the spot?"""
5,"Vegetables Get Cheaper, as Supply to Local Markets Increase",https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/vegetables-get-cheaper-as-supply-to-local-markets-increase/story-es6duPxCrVPNyNjOo41gWN.html,2013-01-13,Hindustan Times,"As Mumbaiites prepare to adjust monthly budgets owing to rising train and bus fares and an expected LPG and diesel price hike, some respite is headed their way thanks to a fall in vegetable prices.The drop in temperature has increased the supply of vegetables to Vashis wholesale Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market, causing a subsequent fall in prices. As compared to early December, prices of some vegetables have fallen as much as 30-40%.Vegetables in abundant supply include ladys finger, capsicum, cabbage, potato and green peas causing their prices to drop drastically.Avinash Patil, deputy secretary, APMC market said, The number of vehicles with vegetables, arriving at the market has increased substantially. While in December about 450 to 475 vehicles came to the market every day, this figure stands between 550 and 575.Patil added, This excess supply has forced prices to come fall and this trend is expected to continue in February as well.To explain the situation better, Patil used the example of green peas. Green peas grow in abundance in winter, providing fresh and affordable stock for consumers. There are 60-65 vehicles of green peas that arrive at the market from Jabalpur, other parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh every day. This has lowered the current price of green peas to Rs. 16-20 a kg in the wholesale market, and Rs. 25 a kg in retail market.Pradeep Gupta, a vegetable vendor at sector 9 market, Vashi said, Owing to favourable vegetables do not perish quickly and hence wastage is lesser.Gupta added, Festivals, such as makar sankranti, do affect prices but it is a temporary rise. On the whole, prices have seen a decline and should continue for a month.Residents are pleased at having to shell out lesser. Sadhana Hampras, Kopar Khairane resident said, With the steady rise on cost of living thanks to spiralling inflation, this fall in vegetable prices will provide much-needed respite to the common man."
6,"It is no sweet  affair for vendors, shoppers",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/305147/it-no-sweet-affair-vendors.html,2013-01-13,Deccan Herald,"It is no sweet affair for vendors, shoppersBangalore, Jan 13, 2013, DHNS: 1:51 ISTIts been dull shopping at the Citys markets ahead of Mondays Sankranti festival this year. Gandhi Bazaar, one of the favourite hubs for many Bangaloreans to buy festive items, was not its usual self on Sunday, as only a few people were shopping for the festival goodies.The slump has been attributed to the increase in the prices of sugarcane, sweet potato, ellu-bella and other items.Vendors said that they were forced to sell the items at high prices due to the crop failure caused by scanty rainfall. Gangamma, who sells avarekai (Indian beans) at Gandhi Bazaar, said this year she had fewer customers than last. She recalled how people thronged to buy avarekai last year.Only 35 to 40 people have come to my shop in the past two days. We are selling soaked (raw) avarekai at Rs 70 per kg, compared to Rs 40 last year.The prices of sugarcane have increased by 20 to 25 per cent this year. In Malleswaram and Gandhi Bazaar areas, a pair of sugarcane stalks is being sold at Rs 80 to Rs 100. An yard of stringed flowers that costs Rs 15 is being sold at Rs 25 at several markets.The price of a bag of ellu-bella (sesame-jaggery mix distributed during Sankranti) has gone up by around 40 per cent this season. A kg of ellu-bella costs between Rs 200 and Rs 220. Shantala, a housewife from Padmanabhanagar, was shocked to learn about the high prices at the Malleswaram market.She said: The middle-class and the poorer sections of society are affected the most due to inflation. We have to think twice and negotiate a lot, before buying any item. I have decided to distribute readymade ellu-bella only to a few houses as I cannot buy in large quantities, given the high prices.The festival season also saw a rise in prices of sweet potatoes. One kg of sweet potatoes is priced around Rs 40, which is more than the usual price. Similarly, the prices of fruits such as apples, pomegranates and mosambis have gone up and have become least affordable. A few vendors in K R Market, after witnessing a dip in sales, were seen selling a pair of sugarcane stalks at Rs 60. Jyothi K, a sugarcane vendor, said: In the morning, we were selling sugarcane stalks at Rs 75 per pair. Later, we reduced the price to Rs 60 to attract more people. Sankranti has thus proved to be a costly affair for both the buyers and sellers."
7,Vegetable prices help people breathe easy,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vegetable-prices-help-people-breathe-easy/article4306105.ece,2013-01-14,The Hindu,"Come Pongal, the one thing that always threatens to trouble people is the cost of vegetables. Well, 2013 may be an aberration, if vegetable vendors are to be believed.According to A. Subramani and S. Akbar Althaf, members of the Kovai Mavatta Anna Motha Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam (an association of wholesale vegetable vendors association), there is no abnormal increase in vegetable ahead of this years Pongal season.The retail price of edible sugarcane, an integral part of Pongal festivities, remains on the upswing in the city markets.The wholesale market has had a good inflow of country vegetables, which people buy for Pongal. Any increase, is only normal.They say that the price of big onion varies from Rs. 15  20 a kg depending on quality, small onion from Rs. 25  32 a kg, apple tomato and country tomato Rs. 12 a kg each, chilli from Rs. 20  25 a kg, potato from Rs. 20  25 a kg depending on quality, cabbage from Rs. 10  12 a kg, beans from Rs. 20  35 a kg, broad beans (avarakkai) Rs. 30  35 a kg, sweet pumpkin Rs. 5 a kg, brinjal Rs. 25  35 a kg, pumpkin Rs. 8 a kg.The aforementioned prices are wholesale they say and add that the prices in the retail market will vary only marginally.After Pongal there is bound to be an increase in prices of vegetables as the inflow will gradually reduce. In the retail market, there has been a good inflow of turmeric plants, neem leaves and flowers that are used to usher in prosperity in homes.The cost of sugarcane was slightly higher a couple of days ago, says vegetable dealer K. Prabhu, adding that on Sunday it, however, went down. A bunch of sugarcane ( 15  20 pieces) was sold around Rs. 250  Rs. 350 a couple of days ago. It has come down by Rs. 100.He adds that the Coimbatore markets have got their sugarcane from Pollachi."

The rate for November, 2012, was 7.24 percent.The rate in increase of prices was recorded at 7.74 percent in the corresponding month of the previous year.Moderation in inflation would give some relief to the policymakers, who have been struggling to balance the need for controlling the inflationary pressure and stimulate economic growth.Inflation has remained at an elevated level despite a tight monetary policy adopted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).There will be pressure on the RBI for rate cuts in its quarterly review of monetary policy for 2012-13 Jan 29, 2012.The latest inflation data also had a positive impact at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).The 30-scrip sensitive Sensex of the BSE increased by more than half a percent in the late afternoon trade.Sectoral indices such as information technology (IT) was up 146.14 points, followed by bank index, which was higher by 120.78 points and consumer durables index which gained by 103.49 points.The RBI has kept key lending and borrowing rates unchanged, saying inflation remained sticky and might rise further.Another barring on the RBI, apart from a slowdown in inflation, will be the November's industrial production data, which had logged a negative 0.1 percent growth year-on-year in November 2012.However, the increase in wholesale-based food price inflation to 11.16 percent in December from 0.79 percent recorded in the corresponding month of 2011, will remain a major concern for the central bank.The rise in food prices was largely due to an exponential increase in the cost of onions, potatoes, wheat, rice and cereals, according to data released by the ministry of commerce and industry.Onions became costlier by 69.24 percent, while potatoes became expensive by 89.68 percent and the price of wheat jumped by 23.23 percent. The price of rice was up 17.10 percent, prices of cereals were up 19.02 percent and pulses surged by 17.57 percent year-on-year.Vegetables became expensive by 23.25 percent in wholesale market.However, fruits' prices dipped a little at 5.76 percent from 8.78 percent a year-ago, while that of milk also slowed down to 5.825 percent from 11.02 percent reported in the corresponding month of 2011-12.The cost of eggs, meat and fish also decelerated to 10.18 percent from 13.10 percent in the corresponding period of 2011-12.Fuel and power inflation moderated to 9.38 percent in December as compared to 14.98 percent in the corresponding month of the last year.Inflation of manufactured products declined to 5.04 percent in the period under review as compared to 7.64 percent in the corresponding month of previous year."

10,"Ohio matched Delhi rape, but that's no consolation",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/306090/ohio-matched-delhi-rape-thats.html,2013-01-17,Deccan Herald,"Nicholas D Kristof, Jan 18, 2013 0:46 ISTWHO finds that domestic and sexual violence affects 30 to 60 per cent of women worldwideIn India, a 23-year-old student takes a bus home from a movie and is gang-raped and assaulted so viciously that she dies two weeks later.In Liberia, in West Africa, an aid group called More Than Me rescues a 10-year-old orphan who has been trading oral sex for clean water to survive.In Steubenville, Ohio, high school football players are accused of repeatedly raping an unconscious 16-year-old girl who was either drunk or rendered helpless by a date-rape drug and was apparently lugged like a sack of potatoes from party to party.And in Washington, the members of Congress show their lack of concern for sexual violence by failing to renew the Violence Against Women Act, a landmark law first passed in 1994 that has now expired.Gender violence is one of the worlds most common human rights abuses. Women worldwide ages 15 through 44 are more likely to die or be maimed because of male violence than because of cancer, malaria, war and traffic accidents combined. The World Health Organisation has found that domestic and sexual violence affects 30 to 60 per cent of women in most countries.In some places, rape is endemic: in South Africa, a survey found that 37 per cent of men reported that they had raped a woman. In others, rape is institutionalised as sex trafficking. Everywhere, rape often puts the victim on trial: in one poll, 68 per cent of Indian judges said that provocative attire amounts to an invitation to rape.Americans watched the events after the Delhi gang rape with a whiff of condescension at the barbarity there, but domestic violence and sex trafficking remain a vast problem across the United States.One obstacle is that violence against women tends to be invisible and thus not a priority. In Delhi, of 635 rape cases reported in the first 11 months of last year, only one ended in conviction. That creates an incentive for rapists to continue to rape, but in any case that reported number of rapes is delusional. They dont include the systematised rape of sex trafficking. India has, by my reckoning, more women and girls trafficked into modern slavery than any country in the world. (China has more prostitutes, but they are more likely to sell sex by choice.)On my last trip to India, I tagged along on a raid on a brothel in Kolkata, organised by the International Justice Mission. In my column at the time, I focused on a 15-year-old and a 10-year-old imprisoned in the brothel, and mentioned a 17-year-old only in passing because I didnt know her story.My assistant at The Times, Natalie Kitroeff, recently visited India and tracked down that young woman. It turns out that she had been trafficked as well  she was apparently drugged at a teahouse and woke up in the brothel. She said she was then forced to have sex with customers and beaten when she protested. She was never allowed outside and was never paid. What do you call what happened to those girls but slavery?Yet prosecutors and the police often shrug  or worse. Dr Shershah Syed, a former president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Pakistan, once told me: When I treat a rape victim, I always advise her not to go to the police. Because if she does, the police might just rape her again.In the United States, the case in Steubenville has become controversial partly because of the brutishness that the young men have been accused of, but also because of concerns that the authorities protected the football team. Some people in both Delhi and Steubenville rushed to blame the victim, suggesting that she was at fault for taking a bus or going to a party. They need to think: What if that were me?The US could help change the way the world confronts these issues. On a remote crossing of the Nepal-India border, I once met an Indian police officer who said, a bit forlornly, that he was stationed there to look for terrorists and pirated movies. He wasnt finding any, but India posted him there to show that it was serious about American concerns regarding terrorism and intellectual property. Meanwhile, that officer ignored the steady flow of teenage Nepali girls crossing in front of him on their way to Indian brothels, because modern slavery was not perceived as an American priority.Global agendaSecretary of State Hillary Clinton has done a superb job trying to put these issues on the global agenda, and I hope President Obama and Senator John Kerry will continue her efforts. But Congress has been pathetic. Not only did it fail to renew the Violence Against Women Act, but it has also stalled on the global version, the International Violence Against Women Act, which would name and shame foreign countries that tolerate gender violence.Congress even failed to renew the landmark legislation against human trafficking, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The obstacles were different in each case, but involved political polarisation and paralysis. Can members of Congress not muster a stand on modern slavery? (Hmm. I now understand better the results of a new survey from Public Policy Polling showing that Congress, with 9 per cent approval, is less popular than cockroaches, traffic jams, lice or Genghis Khan.)Sceptics fret that sexual violence is ingrained into us, making the problem hopeless. But just look at modern American history, for the rising status of women has led to substantial drops in rates of reported rape and domestic violence. Few people realise it, but justice department statistics suggest that the incidence of rape has fallen by three-quarters over the last four decades.Likewise, the rate at which American women are assaulted by their domestic partners has fallen by more than half in the last two decades. That reflects a revolution in attitudes. Steven Pinker, in his book The Better Angels of Our Nature, notes that only half of Americans polled in 1987 said that it was always wrong for a man to beat his wife with a belt or a stick; a decade later, 86 per cent said it was always wrong.But the progress worldwide is far too slow. Lets hope that India makes such violence a national priority. And maybe the rest of the world, especially our backward Congress, will appreciate that the problem isnt just Indias but also our own."
11,Farmers with record output in frantic search for market ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130118/jsp/bihar/story_16453557.jsp,2013-01-18,Telegraph,"Agriculture minister Narendra Singh (left) at a news meet in Patna on Thursday. Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Patna, Jan. 17: Chief minister Nitish Kumar dreams of one vegetable item from Bihar on the plate of every Indian but farmers are grappling with harsh reality. Potato farmer Nitish Kumar of Nalanda, who created a record in production, was forced to sell off his produce at a piffling Rs 5 per kg last year when the cost of production was Rs 215 per mann (40kg). Nitish the farmer, who incidentally hails from the district of his more illustrious namesake, had produced 72.9 tonnes of potato per hectare. The distress sale, farm experts, said was owing to the fact that the market for agriculture produce has shrunk. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh admitted as much today. We have to find a market for the farmers. The farmers should get adequate price for their produce  at least a profit of 50 per cent over their cost price, he said. Narendra blamed the Food Corporation of India for not purchasing foodgrain from farmers and asserted that the state needed help from the Centre in irrigation projects, energy and increasing storage capacity. This year, farmers are grumbling that primary agriculture co-operatives (PACs) are not procuring their produce. It is being rejected on the ground that the paddy has moisture, said a farmer of Paliganj, located on the outskirts of Patna. Bihar got a prize of Rs 1 crore from President Pranab Mukherjee on November 15 for increasing its productivity of paddy by 35 per cent. Nalanda farmer Sumat Kumar had produced 224 quintals of rice per hectare in 2011-12 beating the world record of 190 quintals a hectare in China. The production of foodgrain in the same year was 1.21 crore metric tonnes, a rise of 35 per cent. Farmers fear that they, like Nalandas potato-grower Nitish, too might have to go for distress sale. According to the last review made by food and consumer affairs minister Shyam Rajak, it was found that only 3.5 per cent of the target set for the procurement of paddy by the PACs had been achieved. I have directed the officials to accomplish at least 30 per cent of the target by the end of January, Rajak said. He added that this year, the PACs will procure 30 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from the farmers. The procurement process will last till April. Funds, bags for storing the grain and measurement machines have already been sent to PACs, the minister said. The state first devised the agriculture roadmap in 2008. When I took over the agriculture portfolio in 2005, the total budget was just Rs 28 crore. Today the departments annual budget exceeds Rs 3,000 crore, Narendra Singh said, stressing that distribution of seeds, technology and bio-fertilisers to farmers were paying dividends. The target for 2017 is 2.34 crore metric tonnes, he informed. Statistics issued by the agriculture department show that the production of rice in 2008-9 was 57.71 lakh tonnes. In 2011-12 rice production shot up to 85.05 lakh tonnes  an increase of 51 per cent. Similarly production of wheat increased from 47.74 lakh metric tonnes to 60.02 metric lakh tonnes in 2011-12, a rise of 19 per cent. The state has already become the highest producer of honey and is aiming to replicate its success in pulse, fruits, vegetables and other allied sectors in the next three to four years, the department said. Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, during his recent lecture in Patna, had pointed out how farming, which once contributed 70 per cent to USs economy, found profits shrinking though its productivity increased. So much so that at one stage it became non-viable and the US had to shift from agriculture to industry to drive its economy. Stiglitz, who was impressed by farming undertaken in a village in Nalanda, issued a similar warning to Bihar. Until the chief minister is able to ensure a market and an adequate return for the farmers, his dream of an item from Bihar on every Indians menu may become a nightmare, said an agriculture expert."

The tomatoes were imported from Holland. The CEO said, ""If farmers here produce this quality (Dutch) of tomatoes and try to sell it at the roadside market, it is certain they won't make good money, as in India, 75% consumers still opt for unorganised retail sector.""According to Biyani, there exist three kinds of India in the country. The first which comprises of 12-14% of the total population picks up a product on the basis of its purchasing power. The second includes guards, salesman, drivers and likewise. And the third is those who are striving hard to fulfil their basic necessities.""The retail sector has only reached the first class till now,"" he said.

15,"How sweet, now turn potatoes into wine",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130121/jsp/odisha/story_16465274.jsp,2013-01-21,Telegraph,"Intoxicating veggie Bhubaneswar, Jan. 20: A four-member research team of Central Tuber Crops Research Institute has successfully prepared red wine from purple sweet potato. The research work has also been published by the International journal of Food Science and Technology. The research team used purple sweet potato for extraction of red wine because of the presence of Anthocyanin pigment, a red colour, in the potato that gives a natural red colour to the wine. This is same as the red wine prepared from grapes. The procedure to make the wine includes peeling and crushing of potatoes before turning them into pulp. Then, water, sugar and other chemical ingredients are added to the pulp and the mixture is allowed to ferment with wine yeast. The wine also contains 9.3 per cent alcohol. Grapes contain direct glucose and fructose, while potato contains starch. The starch is converted to sugar by using the enzyme Amylase, said Sandeep Panda, a member of the team and PhD scholar from Utkal University. The research team said this variety of wine could replace the traditional wine prepared from grapes as it is cost-effective and grapes are not widely available in Odisha. The price of a bottle of red wine starts from Rs 350. But the wine prepared from purple sweet potato costs only half as much, said Panda. Principal scientist of Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, also a member of the project, R.C Ray, said the wine could help the farmers associated cultivate purple sweet potatoes. Odisha is a major producer of sweet potato. So, wine can help many farmers, especially those from the tribal regions, said Ray. He also said that they were in constant touch with organisations, which can use the technology for bulk production of wine. The researchers have also prepared herbal wine from purple sweet potato. The process has also been published by the journal of food processing and preservation. The herbal wine had been prepared with 18 additional medicinal plant parts, including garlic, ginger, night jasmine and cardamom. The researchers claim that the wine can act as a remedy for common ailments such as cold, skin diseases and dysentery. While the manufacturing process of the herbal wine is same as that of red wine prepared from purple sweet potato, the procedure includes addition of medicinal plants before fermentation."

17,Asim warns of chit fund ‘crisis’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130125/jsp/bengal/story_16483375.jsp,2013-01-25,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Jan. 24: Former finance minister Asim Dasgupta today warned of an impending crisis in the state because of an unprecedented rise in mobilisation of deposits by chit funds, willy nilly holding the Trinamul government responsible for pushing small savers towards a bubble that may burst. The chit funds that are mobilising money now will start facing repayment obligation after a few years A crisis is awaiting as the model is unsustainable, Dasgupta told a news conference this afternoon. The growth of chit funds  sources said the number may not be less than 3,000  in the state has become a political hot potato for the Mamata Banerjee government as the Opposition has blamed the ruling party for the mushrooming of these entities, which promise high returns to depositors. Depositors are either promised high rates of interest  at times around 30 to 40 per cent a year  on their deposit or different varieties of assets like land or property at attractive places at a future date. Sources in the state finance department said the annual collections by the chit fund companies would not be less than Rs 15,000 crore. The deposit mobilisation under the small savings schemes has plummeted primarily because of the chit funds, a government source said. Dasgupta, however, did not hold the chit funds alone responsible for the dip in small savings collections. He criticised recent moves of the Centre, such as discontinuing the Kisan Vikas Patra, cutting back on commissions for agents and withdrawing tax exemption benefits from some schemes. But there is no doubt that chit fund companies are growing in the state, he added. Economists have always cautioned people to steer clear of these companies, which come under the purview of Sebi or RBI, as the returns promised by these entities are unreal. There have been several instances of these companies going bust or shutting shop after making repayments in the initial days to lure more depositors. In the last few years of the Left government, we, along with Sebi and RBI, had started investigations into the operations of these companies and got a lot of details about them. We want to know what the present government is doing about these companies, Dasgupta said. According to him, the Left government had drafted a bill in 2003 to crack down on the chit funds. The bill is yet to get presidential assent. Is the state government actively pursuing the matter with the Centre? Dasgupta asked. Both the Left and the Congress have been demanding that the government act against chit funds, many of which have diverse business interests such as in hospitality and the media. But the government is yet to take any concrete action. Attempts by the Left parties to move a motion on chit funds in the Assembly was turned down recently. Some senior ministers, including urban development minister Firhad Hakim, have often blamed the Left Front regime for the growth of chit funds. In the 1990s, we had taken action against several chit fund companies and that prompted others to shut shop . When these companies again sprang up from early 2000, we had tried to bring the legislation. Even though the legislation got stuck, we tried our best to crack down on these companies. Now, it is time for this government to act, Dasgupta said."

They were seeing for the first time farmers selling their produce directly to consumers in a space provided by the government.It is a nice concept was how the team members reacted after going around the uzhavar sandhai on Friday.Explaining the various features to the visiting officials, agriculture officer K. Arumugam, who is in-charge of the B. B. Kulam Sandhai, said that the State government provides space for the farmers to sell their produce and the prices are fixed by the department officials on a daily basis after arriving at a consensus with the authorities at the wholesale vegetable market so that it is mutually beneficial. The idea is that the farmers get the best price by avoiding middlemen and the end-users get farm fresh commodities at an affordable price. The government also gives free transport facility to the farmers to bring the produce. Recently, the government has also introduced electronic weights for use by the farmers in the sandhai.Kannan, a farmer, who sells brinjal, potatoes and drumsticks at the sandhai, told the visiting delegates that his daily sales accounts for nearly Rs. 1,500. My day starts at 7 a.m. in the sandhai and goes on till 1 p.m. On weekends, the sales touch Rs. 2,000 or even more, he noted. For others, who grow more than one vegetable, the sales tip Rs. 5,000 a day.On an average, around 125 to 130 farmers sell vegetables in the uzhavar sandhai daily, while it goes up to 140 on Saturdays and Sundays. The daily turnover stands at Rs. 10 lakh, Mr. Arumugam told the delegates.A senior official accompanying the delegates said that the Odisha government had plans to introduce a similar concept in the State."
19,State wakes up & plans to prod Delhi on chit bill,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130126/jsp/bengal/story_16487911.jsp,2013-01-26,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Jan. 25: The Trinamul Congress government has decided to write to the Centre requesting for speedy clearance of a bill the Left dispensation had passed in the Assembly to crack down on chit funds. The West Bengal Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Institutions Bill, passed unanimously on December 23, 2009, proposes a life term for convicts and has been awaiting presidential sanction since January 2010. Its been three years and the bill is yet to receive the Presidents assent. We feel theres a need to remind the Centre of it so that it becomes a law and its provisions can be used by the state government to curb the mushrooming of dubious chit funds, a senior official said this evening. According to him, the decision was taken about three weeks ago, after the government started feeling the pressure from the Opposition and the Centre to act on the issue. The move is significant as the growth of chit funds has become a political hot potato for the Mamata Banerjee government. The Opposition has blamed the ruling party for the mushrooming of these entities, which promise high returns on savings or land or property at a future date. Yesterday, former finance minister Asim Dasgupta had cautioned about an impending crisis in the state because of an unprecedented rise in mobilisation of deposits by chit funds. Dasgupta had asked the government whether it was actively pursuing the matter with the Centre. Attempts by the Left parties to move a motion on chit funds in the Assembly were turned down last month. The Centre, according to finance department officials, has been demanding an explanation from finance minister Amit Mitra and secretary H.K. Dwivedi on what that state has done regarding chit funds. Mitra, according to Writers sources, had to travel to Delhi on a number of occasions in the past couple of months to clarify the states position. Officials said a law on chit funds was much needed. Errant chit funds promising high rates of interest are under the Reserve Bank of Indias scanner, while those promising assets in return are under the Securities and Exchange Board of Indias surveillance. The Left Front government had set up an economic offences wing and co-ordinated with Sebi and RBI to take action against chit funds. The new government is yet to take any concrete step against such entities. Normally, the state government can act only on the basis of specific complaints. The Left government tried to enact the law to ensure comprehensive preventive action but the Trinamul government did not follow it up with the Centre in its first 19 months, an official said. The new law will give the state the power to act on its own, issuing a notification for initiation of action against a delinquent chit fund, attaching its property and bank accounts and urging a designated court to deal with the case. The court will have to complete the proceedings in a year. The provisions will allow the state to take preventive and pre-emptive measures, a finance department official said. He said that when the bill was passed, there were around 65 prominent chit funds in the state and now, the number had increased to 135. In addition to the 135, there are several thousand small entities operating across the state. Once the bill gets presidential assent, companies that are based elsewhere in the country can also be hauled up, the official added. Finance department estimates suggest that the annual collections by the chit fund companies would not be less than Rs 15,000 crore in Bengal. Under the supervision of finance secretary Dwivedi, the state has prepared a list of the 135 companies and is working at the district level on a bigger and exhaustive database. For now, the list of 135 will be shared with the RBI and Sebi. Once the database is ready, we will share it with the Centre as well, a Writers source said."

It is not just the common man who has been hit by the rise in the price of onion but also hoteliers who purchase the poor mans vegetable on a large scale.The Russell Market shop vendors attributed the rise in prices of onion, potato and tomato to the increase in transport costs following the hike in diesel price.The vegetables arriving from Maharashtra used to cost Rs 60,000 a load.

Referring to fluctuating vegetable prices, Aruna, a homemaker, said:  I have cut down on vegetables such as garlic and onion and started using other vegetables more. As a result, of late, my familys food habits have changed."

The price of onion, a must-have in most cuisines, has shot up by Rs. 10 a kilo in a month, selling in retail at an eye-watering Rs. 34 a kg.The poor mans condiment, which was being sold at just Rs. 20 to Rs. 22 a kg a month ago in Bangalore, is now hovering at Rs. 32 to Rs. 34, according to Nagaraj, a grocer on Ullal Main Road.Mr. Nagaraj said when he sourced his stock from the wholesale market last week, it was Rs. 28 a kg, compared to Rs. 16 a month ago.This increase in price has affected individual households and hotel owners as well since onion is an integral part of daily food.Raghavendra Karanth, who runs a hotel, said he has had to cut back on the use of onions in the dishes to ride the price rise. There is also talk of hotel owners preparing to increase prices. Shakuntala Shetty, a homemaker in Jayanagar 5th Block, said that her family requires at least five kg onion a month as she uses the aromatic bulb for every other dish. Its difficult to prepare food without onion and now I am making up using tomato and capsicum.Onion merchants, however, expect the price should come down in the coming days.S. Balakrishna, vice-president, Bangalore Potato and Onion Merchants Association, told The Hindu the wholesale price of fine quality onion in Bangalore market has dropped by about Rs. 2 over the weekend (from Rs. 24 to Rs. 22 a kg). Its effect should be visible in the retail market in about three days since retailers have to sell their existing stock.He, however, ruled out a repeat of 2008-09 when the price of onion touched a vertiginous Rs. 80 to Rs. 85 a kg. With the new crop in north Karnataka almost ready for harvest and produce from Maharashtra arriving in good quantity, the price is set to decrease, Mr. Balakrishna said. The demand for a ban on onion export too could exert pressure in price reduction in the local market, he felt.The Bangalore Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee receives an average of 10,000 quintals of onion every working day. But at least half the produce gets distributed to neighbouring districts and States."

To hide it and unhealthy pigmentation of these substandard potatoes, very fine clay called Ela Mitti' and most of the time even cheap synthetic colours are used. Even deep holes in these potatoes are filled with clay.Customers allege that in a kg of potato bought in the city, there remains around 150 grams of colour and clay. Unless the potatoes are cleaned properly, the clay and synthetic colour can prove to be harmful for consumers. Such substandard potato is usually sold at a low price. To have a check on price of onion, the traders were directed that the difference between retail price and wholesale sale price with addition of transportation cost should not be more than Rs. 2.Wholesalers and retailers were directed to have boards displaying wholesale and retail price of onion and potato along with ancillary costs.Sale of substandard potato is on the rise causing worry to customers"

The humble tuber has doubled in value since February 2012, beating all other asset classes by miles (see table).Fears of a crop loss due to the extreme weather conditions in potato-growing regions has led to rampant speculation in potato futures in the past one month.In January, the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) levied a 20 per cent special margin in addition to the existing 10 per cent margin payable on all buy-side potato future contracts following a spurt in the prices of the vegetable.Potato futures shot up by 13.30 to 844.90 per quintal on Friday as speculators created fresh positions even as potato arrivals from producing regions remained subdued. Futures prices have risen 20 per cent in the past four months.The cold wave sweeping northern India may have been bad news for the potato crop but it has benefited wheat farming.Wheat prices have shot up 27.6 per cent in the past one year due to overstocking by government agencies. Analysts believe the government will have to sell, possibly export, the old stock to be able to accommodate the bumper crop that is awaited this year.While the spurt in commodity prices has certainly made investors wealthy, the rise has also eaten into the wallets of consumers.Food, tobacco and beverages make up nearly half of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Non-Manual Employees (CPI-UNME).

And these have amassed lakhs and crores. These committees are headed by either a minister or an MLA (of Trinamool). These are collecting money from the locals. Is it not extortion?"" he said at a rally in the city on Sunday.He added: ""At the moment if anything happens, it is dubbed as concocted and false, the police will do what they understand of it. That is what happening now. Antisocials will have a free run. It's not that nothing had happened earlier. But never did antisocial activities reach such a height."" he said.If Trinamool leaders were under the impression that Bhattacharjee would be subdued after their threat of legal notice and personal attacks - first by Firhad Hakim and then by Kalyan Banerjee - they couldn't have been more wrong. Bhattacharjee in fact scaled up his attack against the Mamata Banerjee government questioning its double-speak on the price rise. ""Electricity prices are rising and the Centre has nothing to do with it. The state has increased the transport fares, but is it running well at all? After the fare hike, least they could have ensured is better services. The diesel price has been hiked and who gains the most from it? The state government. If they are so keen why don't they reduce the state tax component and give relief to people?"" he said. .""Prices have shot up beyond control. Nothing is cheaper now, not even vegetables. So how did they deal with it? Ministers were photographed going to the markets with vegetables - and in one case potato - in their hands. What did they think? Going to markets and holding vegetables will reduce prices? Did prices fall for a single day? No it hasn't. Instead it has only increased,"" he said.On asking where is Bengal headed, he alleged, ""Even the education sphere has lost its sheen. If education is hampered all the good done comes to a naught.""Assembly opposition leader Surjya Kanta Mishra took a dig at Mamata for the Mati Utsav. ""I have heard that they had to dig up a pond, water it with a deep tube well and put fishes in it. I believe Rs 14 crore was spent on it.

I do hope it publishes its achievements. It had done that on completing 100 days and then again after a year. But I wonder what will they claim now? For, the chief minister herself had said she had completed 90% of the work in the first year, so should we think they didn't work enough during the second year or overachieved."""

The potatoes have low-sugar or zero-sugar value and are ideal for making good quality chips.Encouraged by the response, the Madhya Pradesh government has drawn up plans to make a potato hub in the Mhow region. ""The Horticulture and Food Processing Department of the state plans to register potato growers and officials are holding talks with villagers in this regard,"" said an official of the department.Of all the places, Kodariya, a village on the outskirts of Mhow, comes alive with many makeshift factories, which surface during the months of February, March and April.These open-air workplaces are very simple yet they support a business that in this village alone is estimated to be to the tune of Rs 18 crore. Significantly, around 70% of potato produced in the Malwa region is used for making potato wafers.Rajasthan is the biggest consumer of dried potato chips, accounting for 40% of the total production, followed by Gujarat, Mumbai and even far-off cities like Guwahati and Chennai.This year, the potato prices are hovering between Rs 12 and Rs 15 per kilogram. Last year, potato growers in the Malwa region were hit by sluggish prices owing to a bumper harvest. The cold storage association of Madhya Pradesh had also raised the rents for storage, citing input price hike. Things, however, are much better this year with farmers being able to make small profit.The method of making chips is very basic. New potato with tender skin is put in a drum with abrasive inner lining on a rotating table. The bruised skin is washed away with water and the potatoes are put in another contraption fitted with different blades to slice the potatoes.The chips are boiled in water, drained and sun dried before being packed. For three months, it provides employment to some 10,000 to 12,000 people who work at the factories.Apart from micro industries, big players such as Pepsico, ITC, and Parle also purchase potatoes in bulk from the region."

It was 7.23 per cent in January, 2012. Food and primary articles have shown higher annual price rise, led by onion (111.52 per cent) and potato (79.07 per cent). Besides wheat, vegetables, rice and cereals too became dearer.Commenting on the inflation numbers, Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) Chairman C Rangarajan said it would further decline to 6.5 per cent by March end, but asked the government to release more food stock to ease price situation.""Retail inflation is still high. WPI inflation in primary and food articles are still at higher levels. Efforts should be made to release larger stocks of food articles in the market,"" Rangarajan said.Retail inflation stood at 10.79 per cent in January mainly on account of higher prices of vegetables, edible oil, cereals and protein-based items. As per official data, inflation in manufactured items category fell 4.81 per cent in January from a year earlier, compared with an annual rise 5.04 per cent in December.Inflation in food items and primary articles category was at 11.88 per cent and 10.31 per cent respectively in January. Fuel prices rose 7.06 per cent in January, compared to 9.38 per cent in December. A likely increase in prices of diesel and petrol will reflect in February inflation number, which will be available next month.Commenting on inflation, Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said: ""Inflation is still above the comfort level and it should come down further"".Easing of inflation would provide much needed space to the Reserve Bank to lower policy rates going ahead. The RBI had projected March end inflation to be 6.8 per cent.Although it is still above RBI's comfort zone of 5-6 per cent, the declining in the January inflation and subdued growth in industrial output could prompt a rate cut going forward.Industry chamber CII said there was a need to address the supply side bottlenecks to increase availability of food stocks.""The declining trajectory of both headline and core inflation has created sufficient room for RBI to cut its policy rates by 50 basis points in its review of monetary policy in March,"" CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee.The RBI is scheduled to come out with mid-quarter policy review on March 19.""The mild moderation in core inflation, combined with the weaker-than-expected industrial performance in December 2012, boosts the likelihood of monetary easing in mid-quarter policy review in March,"" ICRA Senior Economist Aditi Nayar said.The central bank had last month lowered interest rates by 0.25 per cent saying that with inflation showing signs of remaining range bound, it was now critical to arrest the loss of growth momentum.According to the advance estimates of Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), the GDP growth in the current fiscal is likely to be 5 per cent. However, the government expects it to be over 5.5 per cent. The economy grew by 6.2 per cent in 2011-12 fiscal."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Feb. 13: Two years ago, this couple spent Valentines Day at a police station, quarrelling and vowing never to see each others faces again. But this February 14, they are set to raise a toast to love, their three-month-old baby in tow. Former Ranji skipper Pravanjan Mallick and wife Cini Mohanty are excited about tomorrow and said they have planned a romantic candlelight dinner at a city hotel. The breach in our relationship has healed in the past year-and-a-half. This Valentines Day will be extra special for us now that we have been blessed with a baby, said Pravanjan, who retired from first class cricket in October 2010. The bond between the couple, who tied the knot in 2003 after a two-year courtship, is a far cry from the days when they were at each others throats daily. The first three years of our marriage were blissful but after that, things went downhill. We did not have personal differences as such but I had problems in adjustment. I have been raised in a nuclear family and Pravanjan has a joint family. After a point, I could not take it anymore and left his house, said Cini, tightly clasping her husbands hand. Pravanjan then filed for divorce in 2010 following which the duo underwent regular counselling sessions for possible reconciliation. But things did not work out the way they wanted. The memory of Valentines Day 2011 still rankles. On Pravanjans invitation, Cini had gone to meet him and the two were together in his car when he suddenly flew off the handle and slapped her. She thought that was the end of their marriage. She went straight to Mahila police station and lodged a complaint. Pravanjan, who followed her to the police station, was promptly taken into custody. Though she pleaded for his bail, she was firm on wanting a divorce. After months of separation, we began craving for each other again and realised each others worth. A patch up wasnt easy considering the amount of damage our relationship had suffered because of media glare. But it was Pravanjan who made the first move and suggested that we start afresh. We went on a second honeymoon to Goa, spent quality time together and things started improving, smiled Cini. A year later, the couple moved into a house of their own and last November, they were blessed with a baby girl, whom they have named Dhanishta. Things have positively changed after this little angel came into our life. We have become more responsible. Earlier, I knew nothing but cricket. Now, I know the price of potatoes and onions, grinned Pravanjan."

""It will not be hard to service the debt.""Buffett, 82, has been seeking deals after the cash pile at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire climbed to more than $45 billion. He has previously wagered on consumer products through equity investments in Coca-Cola and he helped finance Mars' purchase of chewing gum maker Wrigley.The condiment maker, led by CEO Bill Johnson since 1998, had gained 17% in the past 12 months as it boosted sales in developing economies. Heinz in November said fiscal secondquarter sales in emerging markets rose 13%, excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations and acquisitions or divestitures.Heinz elected billionaire Nelson Peltz to the board in 2006 following a six-month proxy fight. Peltz had been pushing the company to trim costs and sell assets to boost the ketchup maker's share price. 3G will oversee the operations of the business, Buffett told CNBC, praising the investment company's record with Burger King, which it acquired in 2010 and then took public last year. He said he expects Johnson to remain in charge and that 3G will have the final say.""Any partnership where I don't have to do the work is my kind of partnership,"" Buffett said.

The government must provide necessary infrastructure like traditional seeds, irrigation, fertilizers etc so that the farmers can get good produce and remunerative prices. This will encourage more people to take to farming. Above all, the government should deploy good agricultural officers who are willing to go to the fields and teach the farmers modern techniques.Awdhut Prabhudesai, doctor, ColombFirst and foremost, all land where traditional vegetables and fruits are grown should be identified, such as in Canacona where chillies are grown and in Agassaim where brinjals and sweet potatoes are grown. Incentives should be given by the government to the farmers to grow the traditional fruits and vegetables in such places. Cooperative societies to collect and market this local produce should be set up and special cold storages to preserve the output should also be provided. Government should also help in training skilled labour for agricultural operations. In this way locals will benefit as they will get some income and it will encourage people to take to farming.John Phillip Pereira, businessman, Nagoa-VernaWe have forgotten the old traditional methods of growing tasty and healthy fruits and vegetables because of our lethargy and allergy for hardwork and patience. We have to overcome this problem urgently to give a boost to traditional fruits and vegetables. Government should organize regular agricultural seminars to create awareness on medicinal properties of traditional fruits and vegetables and the agriculture department should take the lead in giving guidance to the people. One can convert garden and kitchen waste into rich manure to increase agricultural output.Ashok Dande, landscape artist, TaleigaoThe rate at which agricultural land is being absorbed for building constructions and converting our natural beauty into concrete jungles, very soon there will be no land left for cultivating traditional vegetables and fruits. We will have to find some new technology to grow plants on such concrete jungles.

Leading the price spiral were basic staples such as onions and potatoes which were up 111.52 per cent and 79.07 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis. Moreover, kitchen greens, protein-based items as well as wheat, rice and other cereals also turned dearer, which goes on to explain why retail inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) inched up further to 10.79 per cent during the month.Food inflation still highCommenting on the WPI numbers, Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) Chairman C. Rangarajan viewed that even though headline inflation would ease further to 6.5 per cent by the end of March, food inflation both at the consumer and wholesale levels were still high and called for release of more food stock. Retail inflation is still high. WPI inflation in primary and food articles is still at higher levels. Efforts should be made to release larger stocks of food articles in the market, he said.As per the WPI data, inflation in manufactured items category eased to 4.81 per cent in January from a year-ago period and was lower than the level of 5.04 per cent in December. On the contrary, inflation in food items and primary articles category during the month was at 11.88 per cent and 10.31 per cent, respectively.

High quality tomatoes are quoting Rs. 50 a crate (24 kg).Bumper crops in Andhra Pradesh is one of the reason for the crash in prices.Traders from Chinthamani and Kolar in Karnataka, and Madanapalli in Andhra Pradesh did not turn up to purchase tomato from here, as they could procure them at the same price there itself. This has resulted in farmers incurring heavy losses. Many dumped the produce on roadsides. Tomato, cabbage, and potatoes are produced in Hosur region and they enjoy a premium price in all markets.Tomato is cultivated in more than 3,000 hectares in and around Hosur, Denkanikottai, Anchetti, and Royakottai with an annual production of over 50,000 tonnes.Tomatoes from these places reach wholesale markets at Rayakottai, Krishnagiri, Shoolagiri, Palacode, and Hosur.

Doorvasar, a wholesale merchant at the Royakottai Tomato Market told The Hindu on Saturday that the varieties such as Red Ruby, Surabi, 618, 1196, and Bramma are cultivated in large quantity in this region.This time the farmers got a very high yield. The market receives 3,000 to 4,000 crates of tomatoes daily and are auctioned at 11 a.m. The lower prices were likely to prevail for another two months.

This realization is yet to dawn on the central government, which has surrendered to the situation,"" Swain said, demanding a discussion on the issue in the House.BJD members Amar Prasad Satpathy, Bishnu Das and Prabhat Biswal supported Swain's demand and criticized the Centre's policies. They said the bandh was 'unprecedented' as never before a two-day shutdown had been held, affecting normal life. The Congress MLAs, instead of expressing concern over the price rise and the bandh, were making mockery of those raising the issues, they said.Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh countered the BJD MLAs, saying the ruling party was raising the issue of price rise issue to divert attention from the complaints filed by the police about the BJD leadership's links with the Maoists. ""They should know that rise in petrol and diesel prices were governed by international market forces and the Centre cannot do much about it. Even then the UPA government was making efforts to curb the price increase,"" Singh said.The Congress leader noted that trade unions were observing bandh not only against price rise but also against the state government's 'indifferent' attitude towards certain labour issues.

Whoa!,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/What-breakfast-Whoa/articleshow/18650888.cms,2013-02-24,The Times Of India,"Breakfast, it is universally agreed, is the most important meal of the day. We eat breakfast after a lag of almost ten hours since dinner the previous night and it is important we have a sumptuous meal at the start of the day. A good breakfast inevitably makes you feel good first thing in the morning and without a proper breakfast I usually have ended up eating much more for lunch than I'd have liked.In the West, breakfast is standard. Cornflakes, fruits, yogurt, eggs to order, bacon, sausage, toast with butter or jam and tea or coffee. Most cafes in the world will serve this breakfast day in day out month after month. Occasionally a doughnut or a croissant may be introduced as variation. Having eaten this breakfast for months on end, in fact years while living abroad, it was only natural that I'd start craving for the variations I'd be given at home in Kolkata. Rather, the varieties that Kolkata offer at minimal cost makes it the best breakfast city in the world. From the well known breakfast at Flurys, a rare treat on a Sunday, to the street side telebhajar dokan in North Kolkata with its fresh early morning fare, the varieties in Kolkata are endless.A typical North Kolkata breakfast on a Sunday for example can very well consist of a hot singara and a couple of kachoris. A piping hot singara with tamarind chutney with a jilipi to round it off - things couldn't get any better. Having two kachoris and a singara on the way to the bazaar in the morning is a typical North Kolkata ritual that is still observed today. Every narrow by-lane in North Kolkata has a street side telebhajar dokan, all with their loyal band of customers. It is this chance to stop at the telebhajar dokan while going to the bazaar every morning that helps counter the monotony. Some of these street side stalls experiment with the morning fare and the phulkopir singara or the dal vada, made once in a while, are in high demand. Winter inevitably brings the natun aloor tarkari to go with the kachori and it is a challenge to stop at two kachoris during these months. Readers who are fans of the Bengali sleuth Byomkesh Bakshi will know what having a phulkopir singara with muri can do to liven up an off-colour morning.Watching the singara being made in the morning at one of the many street side stalls is sheer bliss. First the dough has to be made correctly to ensure the crust isn't hard. Then the singaras are given shape with the potato stuffing and then twenty or more singaras are released into the boiling hot oil. Again, traditional Kolkatans will tell you that the stuffing shouldn't be made with smashed potatoes. While commercial considerations force such shortcuts, real singaras are made with choto kore kata aloo and is a 19th century tradition. Just when the singaras are perfectly browned, not too much because there's always a chance they will get burnt, they are all scooped up to serve the many hungry customers waiting patiently for their turns.Nowhere else in the world do you get this variety. For example, in some North Kolkata households the day starts with phulko luchi and tarkari. And each of the luchis would have to be adequately fluffy - flat luchis mean the person making them has failed to deliver. Hot luchis just out of the frying pan with smoke coming out every time you pierce the crust and tarkari, spiced with dried red chillies and fresh coriander leaves means the day starts with a spark! And the luchis, which are made in real numbers, keep coming to ensure plates are never empty. Luchis also change colour on occasions. From the maidar luchi to attar luchi, certain varieties of luchi are made to suit certain types of tarkari. Finally, the tarkari too changes each morning. From simple aloor tarkari to aloo tomator tarkari to aloor beguner tarkari to chola diye kumror chakka to ghugni, breakfast is often the highlight of the day in most North Kolkata Bengali families.More than most things it is the local food that one misses when staying away from home. Things that we take for granted, a telebhaja for example has a ubiquitous presence in Kolkata, is one of the most missed food items when living away from the city. Packaged singaras sold in the supermarkets like Sainsburys hardly whet the appetite and people just tend to hog at the local delicacies when they make it back to the city again.It is time now for my piping hot morning singara.(The writer is a journalist and author)"
40,'What India needs is a credible Budget',http://www.deccanherald.com/content/314584/what-india-needs-credible-budget.html,2013-02-24,Deccan Herald,"'What India needs is a credible Budget'S V Krishnamachari, Feb 25, 2013, DHNS 20:38 ISTHemmed in by accusations of financial misdemeanour, relentless filibuster from the Opposition, flippant allies and worsening macro-economic environment, the Congress-led UPA, in its second stint, is least poised to eschew realpolitik for reforms. The upcoming string of Assembly elections, to be followed by general elections next May, leaves little legroom for further manoeuvring. Yet, the government can neither allow the situation to drift nor be complacent, as it did two years ago despite the signals, says Arvind Virmani, former chief economic advisor (2007-09) in the Union Finance Ministry and currently Non-Resident Fellow, Brookings Institution, in conversation withS V Krishnamachari of Deccan Herald. Edited excerpts:How does one explain Indias economic downtrend? Could no economist see it coming?In the 2008-09 economic survey, I had warned that there was a danger of complacency. Everybody  in politics, government and industry  was beginning to take growth for granted, that somehow we are on the 8 to 9 per cent growth path. The recovery (after the 6.7 per cent growth in 2008-09) to higher levels for two years was quick, so the impending slowdown was ignored, so to speak. But it caught up very quickly after that. We allowed ourselves to be misled by complacency.What are the implications now?Our failure to act then means that we have lost two years. Now the task is much more difficult and calls for drastic measures. There is a positive side to it, though. The political system has finally realised that if there is a sharp downturn like now, it is actually a political liability.What are the options available with the government now?Well, macro-management has to change.The commitment to hold fiscal deficit to 5.3 per cent of GDP this year and 4.8 per cent next year is a good start. Next, the government needs to come out with a credible Budget. What exactly do you mean by credible Budget?The Budget should lay out clearly the subsidy and expenditure projections.There would be a tendency to shave them when placed in a tight spot, as the government is now, and then add supplementaries through the year. But this time, it will be difficult for the finance minister (P Chidambaram) as there is a threat of rating (sovereign) downgrade to junk status. The issue is: can he convince his colleagues? The problem was not so serious two years ago, thats why they didnt do anything. But now it is too late.Would that suffice?Well, a planned cut in expenditure needs to be combined with a greater loosening of the monetary policy.Indias exports are on the decline and the external environment doesnt look like improving in the near future. This has resulted in record levels of trade deficit ($19 billion in January this year) and consequently increased dependence on dollar inflows. Is it sustainable?Many of the visible negative indicators can be linked to the problem of fiscal deficit. We have high current account deficit (CAD), which is kind of unprecedented and clearly not sustainable. So, there is a fundamental problem, unless CAD is brought to reasonable levels, India will continue to be increasingly at risk and vulnerable to fluctuation in capital flows.Concerns on inflation continue to persist, isnt it?Yes, inflation is high; part of that is due to supply-demand imbalance and the rest due to the fiscal stimulus that increased the demand for non-tradeables. If you increase the rate of money supply without doing anything on the fiscal deficit, larger part of it will translate into inflation.India Inc is staring at huge levels of debt. On the other hand, depositors are getting lesser returns, if inflation is factored in.If one looks at the spread of banks, both lending rates have gone up and borrowing rates have gone down. So there is an increase in spread in the banking system in the past two-three years. Result, there is a negative impact on both investments (finance costs going up) and financial savings (low returns). Also, this is where gold comes in.Why has that happened?Its all due to government action, some explicit and some, not-so-explicit.Explicit are those where there was emphasis on the funding part of infrastructure. Its a mistake that many economists - both inside and outside the government - made, they all thought of it as a funding problem. Actually, it is a policy issue. For instance, coal linkage. If you get the policy and regulatory structure right, you will get tonnes of funding. But all this was lost and banks are now saddled with huge non-performing assets.Is there more to it, the way banks function?Apart from risk, the other worrying aspect is inefficiency, of regulated competition. Just because there are separate managing directors for public sector banks, it does not take away from the fact that majority ownership lies with one owner  the government. My good friend Rakesh Mohan (former deputy governor, RBI) always used to say: These are separate, independent banks. But thats not so. They look for signals from the finance ministry; they act like one and dont compete. This needs to change. The fundamental competition will come only when the government starts reducing equity stake in public sector banks below 51 per cent, making them truly independent. A few licences to new players and the presence of existing private banks wont change the underlying nature of banking in India.Isnt that a hot potato for politicians?Of course, it is. Its a problem that wont be solved in the next two years. Definitely.Of late, there is a buzz on taxing the super-rich more. Whats your view?What worries me most is that in too many cases, we have gone away from policies that have actually worked in the last few years. The reforms that we undertook in direct taxes, customs duty, excise and so on. It was a clear approach  simplify rates, simplify the system, reduce exemptions and increase voluntary compliance.If it is question of only taxing the rich, its an example of lazy thinking. I am sorry to criticise the revenue department. I have dealt with them for 20 years; if you leave them alone, they always go back to the same old ways of thinking, which is short-term tax raising. This creates havoc. Its just not sustainable. We have done many tax reforms over the years, to lose all that will be a big shame.Will there be a cascading effect if the government cuts expenditure?I have always argued that this is a fallacy. Its a neo-Keynesian theory and applies to Europe. But given the situation that India is in now, a reduction in expenditure combined with a loosening of monetary policy will actually be expansionary in terms of growth. There is a strong case for it."
41,Budget 2013: FM curbs plan spend in FY13 to Rs 4.28 lakh crore,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/budget-2013/pre-budget/Budget-2013-FM-curbs-plan-spend-in-FY13-to-Rs-428-lakh-crore/articleshow/18672414.cms,2013-02-25,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: For P Chidambaram, this is turning out to be a season for haircuts. The minister has managed to restrict the total plan spending in 2012-13 to Rs 4.28 lakh crore, down by Rs 93,000 crore from the budgeted expense, making sure that the government is comfortably home on the fiscal deficit front.The finance minister has been working closely with Manmohan Singh on the budget process, exchanging daily notes, pouring over the numbers to meet the revised targets. There has been an across-the-board cut by as much as 30% in plan spending of ministries and departments.Ministries like rural development, human resources, road transport, atomic energy and shipping have had their budgets slashed. Defence spending has also faced the axe, even at the expense of irate ministers like defense minister AK Antony. It's another matter that ministries had spent only about 56.8% of the allocated plan expenditure until December on an average, making the case even stronger for Chidambaram.A finance ministry directive caps spending in the January-March quarter to 33% of the total funds allocated, thereby preventing any rushed expenditure at the end of the fiscal. Chidambaram's fiscal consolidation programme's underlying theme has been ""credibility and honesty"", a reason why he revised the fiscal deficit target for 2012-13 to 5.3% of the GDP from the budgeted 5.1%. The total expenditure in the current fiscal is pegged at Rs14.90 lakh crore that includes nonplan spending of Rs 9.6 lakh crore.It is only the plan spending that gives the government room for compression as non-plan allocation is for payment of salaries and pensions, interest and subsidies is fixed. The budget 2012-13 had bumped up the plan expenditure by 18% to Rs 5.21 lakh crore. A compression of Rs 93,000 crore in plan expenditure implies that the government's developmental and social sector spending in the current fiscal has remained flat, at almost the same level as Rs 4.26 lakh crore in 2011-2012.Overshooting of the subsidy bill seems doubtful this time around, as the government has taken some steps to curb subsidies like hikes in fuel prices including diesel, a political hot potato till recently. The other heads of the non-plan spending such as the interest component is only expected to be higher. The cut in the expenditure budget, nearly 1% of GDP in this case, as a means to restrict the fiscal deficit has drawn its share of criticism from economists and analysts, as it comes at the risk of not spending money on capital creation, a must in a slowing economy.""FM had committed and looks like he will deliver... one needs to be very careful about pressing the brakes too hard...But it augurs well going ahead as the RBI will also get room for easing... The government should now create opportunity for the private sector to invest and revive growth,"" said DK Joshi, chief economist, Crisil. The government has cancelled its last dated bond issuance of Rs 12,000 crore, in the first clear signal that it wants to restrict the fiscal deficit to the targeted 5.3% of GDP.But there was little option for the government, as any slippage on the fiscal deficit front could invite a downgrade in the rating from the credit rating agencies. The slowdown in the economy has also resulted in a milder uptake in revenue collections, leaving little room for the government but to slash expenditure.Cutting expenditure budgets and checking government expenses have been a practice with most finance ministers, but the sharp cut this year has been possible since the finance minister worked hard in monitoring every spend of over Rs 200 crore personally. While plan expenditure for 2011-12 was revised to Rs 4.26 lakh crore from the budgeted Rs 4.4 lakh crore, the total expenditure shot up due to higher subsidies outgo to Rs 13.18 lakh crore from Rs 12.8 lakh crore budgeted.""This is one revision in the budget estimates (budegted plan expenditure Rs 5.21 lakh crore) that both the PM and FM are happy about unlike most other estimates, be it growth or current account deficit,"" another official told ET. The PM is particularly pleased with Chidambaram as it would help his government steer the economy back on track, he said."
42,Deciding who gets to eat,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/deciding-who-gets-to-eat/article4453694.ece,2013-02-26,The Hindu,"International agencies are warning of high food prices on a global scale in 2013 if urgent action is not taken. But our government shows little concern. The Presidents address to Parliament had only a cursory mention of inflation. Inflation is easing gradually, but is still a problem, he said. Still a problem? Surely the suffering of people from the relentless price rise inflicted on them by the flawed policies of the United Progressive Alliance deserves more recognition and redress. Perversely, the government is intensifying the very policies which cause price rise.Even the World Bank, whose neoliberal policy impositions are responsible to a great extent for global food inflation, has warned that high and volatile food prices are becoming the new normal. The FAO warns that despite decline in international food prices in the latter quarter of 2012, they remain close to all time highs. Stocks of key cereals have tightened. Among the reasons are the diversion of land from food grains production, speculative trade, low public investment in agriculture and depleted stocks. This critique is as valid for India as it is for the more developed countries.Food vs. fuelWhile the severe drought in the United States, Russia, the Ukraine and elsewhere is also cited as a reason for a likely fall in the production of wheat and a consequent increase in food prices, the FAO has warned that the continuing diversion of land to produce crops for the bio-fuel industry in the U.S., Europe and the growing trend of companies to buy land in developing countries like Africa for growing such crops, will lead to increasing hunger worldwide. By subsidising corn production for bio-fuels, the U.S. pulls out corn from food supply, raising prices. Cars and fuel it would seem are more important than people and food.Food shortages are also ideal scenarios for rampant speculation. Speculation in futures trade in food commodities was one of the crucial causes for international prices skyrocketing in 2008. The impact was disastrous for import dependent countries. In the aftermath of the ruination of millions of families across the world, the G20 countries, including India, had resolved to take remedial measures. In 2010 in the U.S., the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act suggested a set of regulations to curb speculation. To implement the law, the Commodities Futures Trade Commission in the U.S. imposed position limits on the proportion of the market that could be held by any one institution so as to curb the capacity to manipulate prices. Even though the limit was as high as a quarter of the market, it was challenged in court by financial market associations.A U.S. district federal court recently ruled that no such limitations can be imposed, holding that the CFTC has been unable to prove any link between speculation in food commodities and high prices! The CFTC has decided to appeal against this and it will be interesting to see the arguments it puts forward to establish the linkages. Perhaps home-grown loyalists to the U.S. views can take a few lessons from even the limited interventions of the CFTC. But, in any case, the regulations have been put on hold. In the European Union, the regulatory regime which was to be implemented by the end of 2012 has also been postponed.The speculators, in the meanwhile, have been back in business. Barclays Bank has admitted that it made a profit of $548 million and Goldman Sachs made up to $400 million in 2012 from speculation in food including wheat and maize. Glencore, one of the biggest companies in the business, was pretty clear of its priorities. The U.S. drought is good for Glencore said its Trade Wing Chief, meaning thereby that its $2.5 billion pre-tax profit could be further augmented by speculation on the shortages created by the drought. The recent UNCTAD report linking speculative capital with the price rise in food stated that over $400 billion is traded in food commodities, that is 20-30 times the physical production of the actual commodity. The crux of the issue is that high speculation in futures markets pushes up spot prices of the commodity being traded. That is why there is a rising global demand for prohibition of futures trade in essential commodities.Is it any different in India? The government often uses high global prices of food to camouflage its own failure. In fact, the reasons for price rise in India are entirely domestic and self-inflicted.A comparison of the Consumer Price Index for BRICS countries shows that India has the dubious distinction of the highest year on year inflation at 11.17 per cent, with China at the lowest of 1.9 per cent, South Africa at 5.75 per cent, Brazil at 6.15 per cent and Russia at 6.54 per cent. Data provided by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry shows a rise in the wholesale price index of food between 2011-2012 and January 2012-2013 of 11.88 per cent. Some striking examples are the rise in the price of cereals by over 18 per cent, vegetables by 28.4 per cent, pulses by nearly 19 per cent and sugar by 13 per cent. These are the wholesale prices. The increase in retail prices would be even higher.Sugar decontrol is imminent, which will be followed by a further rise in sugar prices. The deregulation of petrol and now diesel prices has a cascading impact on increasing inflation, including in food. Petrol prices have been raised 19 times since 2009, registering an increase of 120 per cent. The price of diesel is up by 67 per cent.Land useMimicking the U.S., India too is ignoring the lessons of the global crisis. Large tracts of agricultural land are being handed over to the private corporate sector, including for real estate. This is in addition to the ongoing policy of incentivising production of export driven cash crops instead of food grains. The last Economic Survey itself reports this fall in gross area under food grains by roughly 5 million hectares if we compare the decade preceding the neoliberal reforms in the 1980s to the two post-reform decades of the 1990s and the 2000s.Self -reliance and self sufficiency in food grain production  which require an alternative policy framework  are now discarded policy pursuits for this government despite their crucial role in protecting Indian consumers from the volatility of international prices.Market manipulationIn India, futures trade in agricultural commodities includes around 25 sensitive food items like wheat, sugar, chana, desi urad, edible oil, mustard seeds, a variety of spices and even potatoes and onions. In the light of the warnings of global food shortages, it is essential for the government to delist food items from futures trade and also to resist the growing pressure to lift the current ban on rice futures. It should learn from the most recent and scandalous example of the highly speculative trade in guar (the gum of which is used as a thickening agent in some foods and also as a sealant for shale gas). In the year ending October 2012, the price had shot up 1000 times yielding profits worth Rs. 1,290 crore to identified companies indulging in speculation. But producers of guar , mainly farmers from Rajasthan, received no benefits as they had already sold their crop. Although the trade has since been suspended, prices are still volatile. Such blatant manipulation of the market invites no punishment in liberalised India.Unlike some other developing countries, India has sufficient stocks, over 6.62 crore tonnes of food grains as on February 1, 2013, three times the norm set for this quarter which is 2 crore tonnes. Given the anticipated shortage in world markets, big companies, foreign and domestic, have started putting pressure on the government to liquidate the stocks by allowing liberal exports. The value of exports of food grains in 2012 was $20 billion or over 1.8 lakh crore rupees. While wheat was exported at global prices of between Rs. 1,800 to 2,000 a quintal, the support price the Indian farmer received was at least one third less at Rs.1,285. The export of rice also was at prices far higher than the MSP. Thus the government helped traders and exporters make profits while denying farmers a fair price.The liquidation of stocks for exports which help traders not farmers is taking place at a time when India is home to a quarter of all malnourished people in the world. The stocks should and must be used to ensure an amount of food grains not less then 35 kg per family at subsidised rates through a universal public distribution systemIt is equally necessary in view of the anticipated global shortage of food grains to use the stocks judiciously as a buffer against hoarding and black marketing. Reckless exports of food grains are not in Indias interests.(Brinda Karat is with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and a former Member of Parliament)By allowing futures trade in food and diversion of farm land for commercial purposes, the UPA government isfuelling the price rise"
43,KMSS helps Barpeta farmers sell produce in Guwahati,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/KMSS-helps-Barpeta-farmers-sell-produce-in-Guwahati/articleshow/18682361.cms,2013-02-26,The Times Of India,"GUWAHATI: Bringing a respite to city residents whose household budgets have gone out of hand due to spiralling essentials' prices, peasant body Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) from Monday started facilitated the sale of vegetables in the city at cheaper than current rates.KMSS has taken the initiative to assist the farmers of lower Assam's Barpeta district who were struggling to sell their produce. To the farmers' benefit, the KMSS has taken the initiative to bring the farmers from Barpeta with their produce to Guwahati in trucks, covering a distance of 100km, without involving the illegal syndicates run by local mafia. Consumers, needless to say, are elated with the move.On the first day, the Barpeta farmers sold their vegetables at Zoo Road Tiniali and Chandmari area in the city. The vegetable stock brought by the farmers got sold out within hours of reaching Guwahati on Monday morning.The Barpeta farmers sold vegetables at almost at half the prices they are sold at in city markets. For instance, they were charging just Rs five per kg for cabbage, Rs six each for cauliflower and tomato, Rs eight for brinjal, Rs seven for potato and Rs 10 for squash.""The vegetables coming directly from Barpeta are much fresher than what we usually get here. At the same time, these veggies are much cheaper. We hope the KMSS will help the Barpeta farmers set up shop at more places in the city,"" said Krishna Talukdar of Chandmari area.Lack of transport facilities is the biggest hurdle for Barpeta farmers in coming to Guwahati to sell their produce. They allege that illegal syndicates along the highways charge huge sums from trucks loaded with vegetables.However, the KMSS challenged the illegal syndicates and brought the vegetable trucks from Barpeta on Monday without paying a single penny to the latter.""Around 6.5 tonnes of green vegetables were brought for sale in Guwahati directly from Barpeta district by the farmers. All this while, these farmers were throwing away their vegetables due to lack of buyers in their home district, but now they have an option. The buyers of Guwahati are also very happy since they were buying vegetables at exorbitant prices in the city until now because of the involvement of middlemen,"" said KMSS leader Amar Bezbaruah."
44,Scientist hails tuber as crop of the future ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130228/jsp/northeast/story_16612459.jsp,2013-02-28,Telegraph,"Visitors at the exhibition on Wednesday. Telegraph picture Jorhat, Feb. 27: The coordinator of the All-India Coordinated Research Project at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, James George, today extolled tuber crops as crops of the future. The scientist made a case for growing colocasia (kosu), kath alu, cassava, tapioca and varieties of yam in Assam because of their medicinal properties and changing climate of the region. Addressing a gathering at Horticultural Experimental Station on the Assam Agricultural University (AAU) campus here today, George said increasing temperature and drought-like conditions which have started prevailing in the region could make tuber crops the best thing to be grown as they give a very good yield in temperature as high as 50 degrees Celsius. Kerala traditionally grows this crop as food crop but Tamil Nadu now has more areas under tuber crops, especially, tapioca as these are grown industrially and is converted into starch which is used in paper, gun and other industries. Maharashtra is now trying to jump onto the bandwagon and Assam should not lag behind, he said. A mobile starch-making unit costs hardly Rs 1 lakh. George said in Kerala after processing these were converted into sago, papad and even chips which were giving a stiff competition to popular potato chips companies. A company which produced chips and distributed these in three districts of the state alone made a profit of Rs 50 to Rs 60 lakh. Children just loved these chips but because of poor publicity this has not caught on, he said. Citing example of places in Bihar like Samastipur and Muzaffarpur, he said farmers there were netting between Rs 1.5 and Rs 2 lakh per hectare and many had given up other cultivation in favour of tuber crops. In another two or three decades if the temperature goes on increasing in this region and rainfall decreases resulting in ground water not being recharged say by 2050, then rice, cereals and pulses will not be able to grow and these tuber crops will sustain the future generations, he said. In Chinas Yunnan province and some other parts a species of yam is grown for their medicinal properties and are consumed as traditional medicine to cure stomach ailments and piles, he said. The vice-chancellor of AAU, K.M. Bujarbaruah, said besides tuber crops, the university was working on many other horticultural crops which would yield more and grow round the year. Some of these will be demonstrated to farmers in a few months time. A tomato plant which produces round the year and can grow up to 30 feet and yield 12kg to 15kg of tomato in a month, automatic machines which will wash and grade potatoes, growing of 1.5 lakh good quality saplings of different vegetables for distribution among farmers every month, growing crops on wasteland and soil-less farming are some of the things which we will show to the farmers, Bujarbaruah said."
45,Cash fails to plug rice loopholes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130303/jsp/bengal/story_16627208.jsp,2013-03-03,Telegraph,"Mamata Banerjee at the Town Hall programme on Saturday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta Calcutta, March 2: Mamata Banerjee today distributed cheques totalling Rs 45 lakh to clear the dues of 169 farmers who had sold paddy to the government last year but the move ahead of the panchayat polls failed to ease concerns about the deficiencies in the procurement system. The farmers  all from Burdwans Manteswar  had sold paddy worth Rs 91 lakh to a local co-operative society, which failed to pay the farmers as the rice mill it had selected defaulted on payments. With the rural polls a couple of months away, the government did not want to sit on the dues. The 169 farmers, who had launched an agitation a few days ago, were ferried to Calcuttas Town Hall, where the chief minister herself handed over the cheques to them. The farmers were paid 50 per cent of their dues three months ago. But the funds for the rest could not be arranged. The chief minister realised that non-payment would send a wrong signal ahead of the rural polls. Thats why the money was released from the chief ministers relief fund, said a senior official of the food and supplies department. Last year, the government had run up Rs 17 crore in paddy dues, of which Rs 16 crore has been cleared, an official said. More than 300 farmers, mainly from Burdwan and Bankura, are yet to get payment for paddy they sold last year. The chief ministers attempt to woo the farmers from Burdwan, the rice bowl of Bengal, did not cut much ice with them as many questioned the efficiency of the procurement machinery. The discontent has surfaced at a time the cash-strapped state government has defaulted on paying its share of premium for a potato crop insurance, adding to the woes of farmers grappling with blight that has infected the vegetable in large parts of West Midnapore and Burdwan. Asim Samanta, one of the 169 farmers from Manteswar who received a cheque of Rs 68,000 today, said: I am relieved that I have got my dues. But I have decided that I wont sell my produce to state agencies again. I had sold 1,269kg of paddy to the state last year but I received the money this year. Farmer Seikh Jahangir, who received a cheque of Rs 97,290, said he had already sold this years produce to local traders at a rate lower than the minimum support price as I did not want to wait for payments again. I have sold about 1,300kg of paddy to local traders at Rs 1,150 a quintal. I know that had I sold my produce to the state, I could have got Rs 1,250 a quintal. But I cant wait endlessly for payments. I need money immediately, Jahangir said. The government procures paddy directly from farmers to eradicate middlemen, who often dont pay farmers the minimum support price. Farmers in large parts of the state are in trouble as the government has so far failed to start the procurement process properly this year because of paucity of funds. According to food and supplies department officials, the state could procure only 3.5 lakh tonnes of paddy directly from farmers till February 21 against the target of 21 lakh tonnes by September. The major portion of the procurement target had to be met by February to encourage farmers to reinvest in the boro season (January to end-February). But that did not happen, an official said. We have already started receiving complaints of distress sale by farmers because of lack of confidence in the states procurement machinery, the official added. The officials said the procurement process was yet to gain momentum because of the governments failure to arrange for the required amount to start the process properly. So far, Benfed has started procurement with only Rs 48 crore while the ECSC has been allotted Rs 92 crore. Confed has started the process with only Rs 5 crore, a senior food department official said. A rough estimate of the department states that the agencies need Rs 1,000 crore for the procurement process. The state government had earlier planned to take a loan of Rs 300 crore from Nabard and another Rs 600 crore from the West Bengal Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation (WBIDFC) to make the procurement process smooth before the rural polls. But the plan was faulty. The state co-operative bank did not get the funds from Nabard. The state was not even aware that the WBIDFC cannot give loans to procure paddy, the official said. Food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mallick, however, said procurement had been good till now. Things will get better because the food department will give Rs 123 crore to the ECSC soon."

He alleged that the Trinamool Congress government had failed to pay its share of the premium for the rabi season, which will in effect deny the insurance cover to the farmers.Mr. Ghosh said the Agriculture Insurance Company of India had issued a circular on February 11 stating that the West Bengal government had not yet issued the complete notification and guidelines for the Modified National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (MNAIS) for the rabi season in the Bardhaman, Hooghly and Paschim Medinipur districts.In the circular, the company states that in the absence of the guidelines it is not authorised to accept premiums in respect to the potato crop in the three districts.Mr. Ghosh also urged the State Government to simplify the process of payments for the paddy procured by the State.The Trinamool Congress leadership has alleged that leaders of peasant organisations affiliated to the Left Front, including Mr. Ghosh, accepted kickbacks on the sale of paddy.Mr. Ghosh replied, Let them provide the evidence. If it can be proven, I am ready to face whatever punishment they have to offer.Leaders of four Left-leaning peasant organisations held a meeting during the day, where it was decided that a campaign will be launched in the rural areas of the State demanding food security, measures to control price rise and creation of employment opportunities."

A prolonged winter and scientific guidance has helped them reap the rich harvest this year.One such farmer P J Chaudhary of Dangiya village is expecting an output of more than 27 tonnes per acre this year. He is looking forward to a gross income of Rs 2.45 crores this season.The new variety of potato was introduced for the first time in the region in 2010. Although some agriculture experts were skeptical about its success in the region, some of the farmers went ahead with its sowing.""For the last two years, we have been reaping rich dividends from this new variety. The potato gets its name from its red outer skin. It fetches a price of Rs 12 per kg in the market while traditional ones are sold at Rs 9 per kg. The prime purchasers are potato chips and wafer producing companies,"" Chaudhary said. Farmers producing the crop say transportation of their harvest is no problem as multinational chains come at their doorstep with their own transportation infrastructure. At least 2,700 sacks of 50kg each are being packed by over 270 labourers every day.Director of research at Sardarkrushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University R L Patel said, ""Chaudhary has come out as a role model as far as production of red potatoes is concerned. We found that that not only do these potatoes have less water content, which is ideal for wafers, but they are also low in sugar content."" The entire red potato cultivation is carried out through sprinkle irrigation system in the region.There are around 50 farmers like Chaudhary who have taken the red potato route to prosperity"

Core inflation was 4.12 per cent in January and 4.24 per cent in December. A slowing core inflation, however, was seen by analysts as a sign of weak economic momentum.Inflation in food articles, which has over 14 per cent share in the WPI basket, though witnessed a decline at 11.38 per cent, it still remained on a higher side. Inflation in the food articles category was at 11.88 per cent in January.

The moderation in core inflation below the 5% mark in February boosted prospects for an interest rate cut. Experts said that RBI is expected to ease its tight policy to boost growth and sentiment. Growth is estimated to slow to a decade's low of 5% in 2012-13 but the finance ministry expects it to be closer to 6% and then recover from next year.""WPI-based inflation rose to 6.84% in February 2013 after falling to a three-year low of 6.62% in the previous month,"" ratings agency Crisil said in a note. ""However, core inflation  an indicator of demand side pressures on prices  fell below the 4% mark for the first time in the past 35 months, strengthening the case for a repo rate cut by the RBI on March 19,"" the agency said.The February data showed that price pressures remained in cereals which rose an annual 19% while pulses shot up 15%. Eggs, meat and fish prices soared 12.85% year-on-year compared to the 10.81% increase in the previous month.Vegetable prices moderated, rising 12.11% in February compared to the previous month's increase of 28.45%.

In February 2012 it was 7.56 per cent.Inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) had declined to a three-year low of 6.62 per cent in January.In the case of manufactured goods, inflation has moderated to 4.51 per cent in February as compared to 5.82 per cent in the same month in the previous fiscal, making a case for easing of the monetary policy by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its mid-quarter review on March 19.Food and primary articles have shown higher annual price rise of 11.38 per cent and 9.70 per cent, respectively, led by expensive onion (154.33 per cent) and potato (45.99 per cent). Besides, wheat, vegetables, rice and cereals became dearer.Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council Chairman C. Rangarajan said the RBI would take into account the decline in inflation in the case of non-food article group in its review.Clearly the decline in manufacturing inflation is the critical number that monetary authorities look at. Therefore, there is comfort in that direction, he added.Fifth monthRetail inflation moved up for the fifth consecutive month to 10.91 per cent in February, remaining in the double-digit terrain for the third month in a row, on account of higher prices of vegetables, edible oil, cereals and protein-based items.As per official data, rate of price rise in the case of LPG cylinder during the month was 26.21 per cent as against 4.28 per cent in the previous month while in case of petrol it was 6.25 per cent as compared to 3.77 per cent in January.Girija Shivakumar adds:Reacting to the inflation figures, India Inc is pushing for a cut in repo rate to revive sluggish gross domestic product (GDP) growth that hit a decades low of 4.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2012-13.Reversal of trendIncidentally, this increase in the WPI-based inflation has reversed its four months of declining trend. The gap between WPI and CPI (Consumer Price Index) has been widening mainly on account of food prices and remains a cause for worry. The CPI inflation was 10.91 per cent in February against 9.14 per cent a year-ago.Naina Lal Kidwai, President, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) proposed the removal of bottlenecks to ease supply of food and goods (this is) vital to tame inflation to control spiralling food prices.This gives room to the Reserve Bank of India to bring down interest rates and complement the intention of the Union Budget to enhance investments. This will help uplift sentiment of India Inc. The green shoots are certainly on the horizon and a concerted push in investment can help bring India back on the growth trajectory, she added.While fiscal consolidation steps taken by the government are likely to encourage growth enhancing monetary measure, India Inc. is keen to address the structural changes that are required, including deregulation of diesel prices."

Simply put, the Union government subsidises food for a large portion of its 120 crore population that eats into its finances and inflates budget deficit. The countrys budget gap stands at 5.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) this fiscal ending March 31, slightly lower than the 5.3 per cent projected earlier by the finance ministry.Other rating agencies such as Fitch and Standard and Poor's have downgraded their outlook on India to ""negative"" from ""stable"", Moody's Investors Service has assigned a ""stable"" outlook. Data issued last week showed food inflation remained over 11 per cent for the second straight month in February as prices of protein-rich foods such as eggs, fish and meat as well as those of vegetables including onions and potatoes rose sharply.The Wholesale Price Index for February showed that food prices increased by 11.4 per cent year-on-year, raising overall inflation for the month to 6.8 per cent, despite a deceleration in core inflation to 3.8 per cent.Moody's pointed out that India's current pace of food inflation is faster than the global average. ""Moreover, although food inflation is not desirable anywhere, it has particularly credit negative implications for India because of its economic structure and policy framework,"" it added.Food inflation ""hurts consumption, government finances, the balance of payments and monetary policy flexibility,"" Moody's said adding, ""..as the Indian government subsidises food for a large portion of the population, increases in food prices inflate government expenditure... and the budget deficit, which is already high relative to comparable emerging markets.""As per the credit ratings agency, food demand is unlikely to fall and food supply is difficult to raise. Food accounts for more than half of average household spending in India, of which rural households spend 57 per cent and urban homes 44 per cent on food. Among the country's poorest rural households, that ratio rises to 65 per cent, Moody's said."

Manju, MLA, at the inauguration of a cricket tourney sponsored by him inArkalgud recently.In Hassan, a political hot spot, nothing is apolitical. Even a cricket match or a theatre performance can turn out to be a campaign tool.Many aspiring candidates are making efforts to attract young voters by sponsoring cricket tourneys and theatre shows before the model code of conduct for the Assembly elections kicks in.The code of conduct comes into force only after the Election Commission announces the election schedule.In the last one month, three cricket tourneys were held in Basavapatna in Arkalgud taluk which saw participation by teams from different villages. Each of these tourneys was sponsored by probable candidates for the Assembly elections. More tourneys would have been conducted by this time if there were no exams, said S. Babu, a resident of Basavapatna.Many villages in the district have a tradition of inviting theatre troupes to stage dramas twice a year. In the run-up to the elections, however, there has been an increase in the number of such shows as there are more willing sponsors.In Bilaguli village in Arkalgud taluk alone, three plays were staged in the recent weeks: Shani Mahatme, Chandasurana Vadhe and Kurukshetra . Similarly, in Ragi Maruru village too three plays were staged, each sponsored by a probable candidate.Every village is divided into many groups, each favouring a different leader/party. When one group stages a show, rival groups also become active and collect funds from their leader to stage another show. The sponsor will be the chief guest for the programme.This trend of cricket tourneys and drama shows is also visible in Arkalgud as the fight for this segment turned interesting after retired IAS officer S. Puttaswamy and founder of Potato Club in the town Yoga Ramesh expressed their interest to contest.Arkalgud MLA A. Manju recently sponsored a dirt track race and a cricket tourney. Mr. Ramesh has long been preparing the ground through various activities under the banner of the Potato Club. He has distributed lakhs of saplings in the constituency through his club. He has constituted groups of youths in many villages to look after the saplings and has been extending them financial support.Many candidates have also been distributing calendars carrying their biodata among voters. Lakhs of calendars have already been distributed.Recently, Janata Dal (Secular) Legislature Party leader H.D. Revanna, who also heads Hassan Milk Producers Union which has jurisdiction over Hassan district and parts of Chikmagalur and Kodagu districts, announced a Rs. 2-hike in the milk procurement price for a litre with effect from March 15. His announcement is being viewed as one aimed at luring milk producers, who constitute a large voting mass in Hassan district.In Hassan, aspiring candidates are sponsoring cricket tourneys, theatre performances"

""The farmers are not getting the proper purchase price share by selling potatoes in the markets. The state will give a support price of Rs 27 crore to buy one lakh metric tonnes of potatoes from the farmers to increase their purchase price share,"" said Rabindranath Koley of the traders' forum, also a task force member.Koley said that the chief minister has also given her nod to export of potatoes from the stateto be exported. ""The government will give permission to export potatoes outside the state.Tamilnadu and Sri Lanka have shown interest in buying potatoes from Bengal. For this, rakes will be arranged,"" Koley said, adding that the chief minister has also instructed to start the 95 kishan bazaars as soon as possible.Last year, when potato prices started rising in the retail markets, chief minister had warned traders not to sell potatoes outside the state till the state's own demands are met. The state government had also decided to start seizing potato sacks stored in the cold storages for a long time unless the cold storage owners do not remove them immediatelyOfficials said that on an average about 1 crore metric tonnes of potatoes are being produced in the state each year and the requirement is about 60 lakh metric tonnes.Koley also said that the traders' forum has placed a proposal for installation of deep tubewells in all the major market places like Burrabazar, Posta, Tiljala and Rajabazar, so that water could be easily accessed during any incident of fire. ""All the major markets in the city are being surveyed by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The CM has asked the municipal commissioner to look into the matter and 10 deep tubewells will be installed from the MP LAD funds.

The MLA expressed concern that the widening of the road between Agasaim and Goa Velha would cause the destruction of productive fields where the famous Agasaim brinjals, sweet potatoes and other vegetables are grown. He also said that the widening would cause the demolition of many houses along the roadside. He pleaded that the government build a flyover instead of widening the road.Dhavalikar responded that the government wants to take up the widening of the road in view of the proposed new bridge over River Zuari.But, he said, since the highway project involves the Union ministry of road transport and highways, the state government has written to the Centre about the project and has even obtained one NOC in this regard.The Centre has advised the state government however to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) on the project. The state government would start this exercise within a month.Dhavalikar said that the government has already acquired much of the area in terms of fields, most of which are lying fallow.Prohibitive costs are involved and the cost of widening the road from Agasaim to Goa Velha is around 27 crore, while widening it from Goa Velha to Bambolim will cost around 50 crore. Dhavalikar said the cost of building a flyover works out to about 27 lakh per square metre.The government will therefore study the feasibility of which is better and proceed accordingly. The position will be clearer in about six months, Dhavalikar said."
56,City chain to expand global food-print ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130320/jsp/calcutta/story_16691553.jsp,2013-03-20,Telegraph,"Whats the latest from Anjan Chatterjees kitchen? A recipe to take Oh! Calcuttas Shorshe Bata Maach to the heart of London and Mainland Chinas Corn & Potato Tsing Hai Style to Dubai malls. While the Bengali arm of Chatterjees Speciality Restaurants, Oh! Calcutta, will open branches in London and Singapore, its flagship brand Mainland China and Global Grill (formerly Flame & Grill) will lead a pack of seven restaurants to the Persian Gulf. Were in the process of taking Oh! Calcutta to international destinations through a joint venture. Were already in Dhaka and will open in Singapore and in the heart of London within the next six months as we think that the brand has great potential. No offence, but Indian food should not be confined to the predictable Tandoori Chicken and Dal Makhni. Theres no reason why a Shorshe Bata Maachh or a Kankra Chingri Bhapa should not be the most exotic thing on the palate of the international community, said managing director Anjan Chatterjee. He added that a bongosantan (son of Bengal) designer and a personal friend would be designing all the international outlets, but did not spill the name. The food czar will dip his chopsticks in the Gulf with Mainland China and add to the variety on the platter of Global Grill, which is now India-centric with its kebabs. There will be Kali Dal with bits of butter, and also Khao Suey, a Thai green curry, and mezze platter, because palates are changing, explained Chatterjee. The first two outlets in Dubai will open in malls  one in Burjuman and the other most probably in Dubai Mall. We want to do it in malls because for six months its very hot there. Closer home, the thrust is on making the companys outdoor catering wing Mobifeast (formerly Speciality Outdoors) a Rs 100-crore business. Mobifeast, which has its central processing unit at Sankrail near Howrah, will soon go national. We were focussed on restauranting but now full attention will be given to outdoor catering because even for star hotels, banqueting is the biggest possible revenue earner. Corporates never compromise; volume drives everything there. Its a bottomless pit, said Chatterjee. Of course, unlike star prices, here the price band is between Rs 800 and (if you throw in items like jumbo prawns and hilsa) Rs 2,000. Calcutta is supposed to be one of the best markets for outdoor catering because people not only like to spend money but also like to experiment. Food theatres, with live stations, are very popular, said chef Rajesh Dubey, who is leading this vertical. The companys inorganic growth, includes the QSR or quick service restaurant format, serving pizza or burger. For this, the group is in active discussions with international chains. It could be a contractual franchisee agreement like McDonalds or Dominos or Pizza Hut through which we operate and expand. Its one of the fastest growing markets and theres no reason why we shouldnt be doing one, said Chatterjee. Calcutta will also get something new from the big brand umbrella to bit into. After its Pune debut in February, all-day casual dining Mediterranean format, Mezzuna, will open in a mall in the city in the next three-four months. Targeted at young India, it will offer wholesome breakfasts for Rs 250-Rs 300 and will be led by chef Somnath Bhattacharya, who helped set up the Indigo chain. The ambition, says Chatterjee, is to become a Rs 500-crore company by 2014-15."

But papers apparently did not reach Speakertable on Thursday.MamataBanerjeeBimanBanerjee'sOnly a day ago, Mamata Banerjee had tweeted that she would support the Congress-led UPA government's stand on the Sri Lankan Tamil issue that has put the central government on the edge.Thanks to the missing papers, the assembly will debate an adjournment motion moved by Leader of Opposition Surjya Kanta Mishra on Friday - but not by Congress.The party will instead be allowed to read out its motion, seeking the government's intervention to curb rising prices of paddy, jute and potato in Bengal.Congress legislative party leader Md Sohrab denied that Mamata's ""support"" for the Centre on the Lankan Tamil issue was any way linked to the ""missing"" motion.""It is wrong to club the two issues together. We are against Trinamool in the state. They are against us in the Centre. Yes, we wanted to submit our own motion to the Speaker. However, it did not materialize. But we insisted that our motion is at least heard. That has been allowed. We will speak on law and order, the governor's address in addition to the motion. It is wrong to say we are going soft on the government,"" Sohrab said.Party MLAs, however, had a different take. A senior Congress MLA said, ""A notice is given by an MLA seeking an adjournment motion an hour before the debate. In the all-party meet preceding the budget session, it was known that the government will allow a discussion on one adjournment motion. We knew we'd be submitting one. Since the Left was seeking one on deterioration of law and order, we decided to choose farmers' problems.""On Thursday, the Speaker informed them that he was yet to receive the Congress motion, he added. ""So, whose fault is it, if it wasn't deliberate?"" he asked.Sohrab blamed ""some technical glitches"". ""Our intent, however, remains the same and it's apparent from the fact that we did manage to get our motion be read out,"" he said.Former parliamentary affairs minister Prabodh Sinha, a senior Left MLA, said, ""The Left Front motion was decided and conveyed long back. We submitted our motion formally on Thursday and it was allowed. It's the first time that this state government has agreed to discuss any contentious issue."""

From having grown up watching first-day- first-shows of Rajinikanth movies to swearing by traditional Tamil meals served on a plantain leaf,Balaji has always worn his citys pride on his sleeve. And for the first three editions of the Indian Premier League,Balaji donned the Super Kings canary jersey too with great passion.Then came the 2011 IPL auction,engineering a major shake-up in the line-ups of the various franchises. And as the gavel came down on Balajis name,with the buying price reading $500,000,he was suddenly no longer a part of his beloved Chennai outfit. Now he was a Knight Rider. While the opportunity to represent the most glamorous of franchises was indeed alluring,the thought of shifting base to alien environs of Kolkata was a daunting one,even if only for two months. Balaji had after all grown up listening to horror tales about the eastern metropolitans traffic,the suffocating crowds,and of course the limited,if not negligible,options for South Indian food.During his first season with KKR in 2011,Balajis diffidence ensured he spent his non match-days within his hotel room. The following season,though,things changed completely. By now,he had warmed up to Kolkatas fervent yet earnest fans. The trams no longer seemed outlandish and the nights were spent relishing the many cuisines that Park Streets got to offer. Hes also become a football fan these days. Most importantly,Balaji had discovered mishti doi among other Bengali sweets.I know I have to look after my diet. But I sneak in a couple at times. They are too tempting, he says. While Kolkata had found a way through to Balajis heart via his sweet-tooth,others in the KKR camp have warmed up to their adopted home in their own way.Rajat Bhatia for one prefers to take time away from the glitz and glamour,preferring to tap into his spiritual side by visiting the Dakshineswar Temple or taking a dip in the Ganges. For their former assistant coach,Vijay Dahiya,however,the deep-rooted culture and tradition of the city and the courteousness  women in general being referred to as didi  that struck a chord with the Delhi man.The IPL has been credited for turning the cricket world into a much smaller sphere by bringing people and cultures together,sharing dressing-rooms and ideas. Some even say that its enhanced the camaraderie between players,turning once foes into fast friends. Prior to the IPL,embracing the culture and heritage of India was an exercise practiced mainly by overseas cricketers,an idea conceived by former Australian captain Steve Waugh.Out of their comfort zoneWith nine franchises spread around different corners of the country,however,a number of local players,like Balaji and Bhatia,too find themselves dislodged from their comfort zones. And as they set about settling into their second homes,they inadvertently end up embarking on their own discovery of India.Fast bowler Siddarth Trivedi had been to Jaipur once on a family vacation in his school days. Being a history buff,he was fascinated by forts and the many epic war stories that are symbolic of Rajasthan. Little did he know then that he would get a chance to soak in the sights and relics that he had heard about all through his life.When the Royals first approached me,I was just over the moon considering that it was a double treat. This place has a tremendous history and folklore, says Trivedi,the only uncapped Indian player to have been a part of the same franchise since IPLs inception.Among the many places of historical interest that hes visited in and around Jaipur,he counts the Amer Fort as his favourite. It was here,explains Trivedi,that the Royals set upon their quest in the first season to upset the apple-cart despite their rag-tag billing.We had come here as a team and were deeply inspired after hearing stories about how Amer had remained an invincible citadel during its time. It is here that Shane Warne said that Jaipur will be our fortress, recalls Trivedi. True to Warnes word,the Royals did not lose a single match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium during their title winning campaign.With glamorous distractions at their behest,it can get difficult for these men to venture out of the lavish cocoon. While most rate a trip to a mall or a multiplex as their preferred getaways,Rajasthans Stuart Binny opts for adventure. He never misses an opportunity to jump into a jeep and go explore sanctuaries in the tiger-reserve state. Ive been to Ranthambore thrice already during my stint with the Royals, wildlife enthusiast Binny says.For Umesh Yadav,the four-year relationship with Delhi and the Daredevils has been a fruitful one. Its seen him rise from obscurity to international recognition now. But the tearaway still remains a small-town boy,as paranoid about the city traffic as he was when he first landed here. I still get overawed by the massive buildings,the fancy cars and the fact that you have to make all your plans based on the traffic, says Yadav.LIFE IN A METROWhat helped ease his initial trepidations,he insists was the adoration he received from the people of Delhi. The loyal support that he receives despite hailing from Nagpur. As Raghu Iyer,Rajasthan Royals CEO explains,its the bond that the outstation players can form with the people of their adopted city that makes all the difference in their quest to assimilate with the place.Rahul Dravid has such a deep affiliation with Bangalore. But once the people of Jaipur accepted him as their own,it was natural that he would reciprocate. In fact,at a literary festival last week,one fan asked everyone on the dais a question except Rahul,claiming that our skipper was a Jaipuri anyway and could be approached any other time, says Iyer.The greatest example of this public acceptance in the IPL is how the Chennai Super Kings take proprietorship of Mahendra Singh Dhoni,to the extent that he was even seen imitating Rajinikanth in an advertisement or two. That is the most important connection. It helps you settle easier. The fans in Chennai dont just want you to win,they want you to entertain them both on and off the field, says Wriddhiman Saha,Dhonis back-up keeper with India and CSK.Unique fan-followingBut fans are not the same everywhere,claims pacer Praveen Kumar,who spent his first three IPL years in Bangalore before being bought by Kings XI Punjab in 2011. In contrast to Bangalore,the Mohali supporters are far more forgiving. You get more privacy here. Its mainly a family crowd that turns up. Even if you lose theyll never get abusive. Youll rather hear them saying,Shaam ko lassi-wassi pine,agla match ache se khelenge, says Kumar. In Punjab,I have hardly ever posed with just one person for a photograph. Its always a whole family.How much ever the long association with a franchise gets these players in-sync with the heartbeat of their respective second homes,access to food of their choice is not always guaranteed.Considering a sportsmans diet is rather regimented,do these players ever get to indulge in the local delicacies? Yes,insists Trivedi. Theres a traditional eating place called Choki Dhani,where you get a variety of Rajasthani dishes. Its a big hit with the overseas players, he says. And what would be his personal favourite? Laal Maas (a spicy meat dish) and Crispy Bhindi,which by the way are always on the menu on match-days,courtesy me.Bengali cuisine,for many,is an acquired taste. Balaji and his taste-buds agree. I have actually begun relating some dishes with the food I am used to back home. I love the Radha Pallavi (puris with potato curry) and the Macher Paturi (fish in mustard sauce), he says. Incidentally,for Saha,it is the other way around. The Bengal player playing for Chennai is now big on the masala dosa.With IPL 6 just two weeks away,its Shondesh time for Balaji again. And as they head toward their adopted homes,they can at least be rest assured that they are longer strangers in their own land.The out-of- townersAsk the man on Chennais street and he will tell you that the Almoda-born Ranchi-raised Indian cricket captain is very much a local hero. Ditto is the connection between Bangalore and Virat Kohli. So what makes Dhoni the new Thalaivar and why is Kohli often referred to as Namma Virat? Their loyalty to the respective citys IPL franchise. The Sunday Express takes a look at those who have spent at least two seasons in a city they wouldnt have otherwise called home.ALL FIVE SEASONS:MS Dhoni (Chennai),Suresh Raina (Chennai),Virat Kohli (Bangalore),Harbhajan Singh (Mumbai),Piyush Chawla (Punjab),Ramesh Powar (Punjab),Siddarth Trivedi (Jaipur),Iqbal Abdulla (Kolkata)FOUR SEASONS:Shadab Jakati (Chennai,2009-2012),Amit Singh (Jaipur,2009-2012)THREE SEASONS:Umesh Yadav (Delhi 2010-2012),Abu Nechim (Mumbai 2010-2012),Ambati Rayudu (Mumbai 2010-2012)TWO SEASONS:Manpreet Gony (Hyderabad) Wriddhiman Saha (Chennai)Anand Rajan (Hyderabad) Shikhar Dhawan (Hyderabad)Amit Mishra (Hyderabad) Varun Aaron (Delhi) Ajit Agarkar (Delhi) Shahbaz Nadeem (Delhi) Naman Ojha (Delhi) Irfan Pathan (Delhi) Venugopal Rao (Delhi) Bhargav Bhatt (Punjab) Siddharth Chitnis (Punjab) Praveen Kumar (Punjab) Paul Valthaty (Punjab) Laxmipathy Balaji (Kolkata) Rajat Bhatia (Kolkata) Manvinder Bisla (Kolkata) Gautam Gambhir (Kolkata) Yusuf Pathan (Kolkata) Munaf Patel (Mumbai) Stuart Binny (Jaipur) Ankeet Chavan (Jaipur) Rahul Dravid (Jaipur) Ajinkya Rahane (Jaipur) Arun Karthik (Bangalore) Cheteshwar Pujara (Bangalore) Saurabh Tiwary (Bangalore)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

With Holi around the corner, stores have reported an unprecedented rise in demand for eco-friendly and organic colours this year. Stores selling them have stepped up their game by putting up several stalls across the city while some others have included these skin-friendly colours in their inventory.""We have sold off almost our entire stock even as a few days are left for the festival,"" said Abhinav Gangumalla, chief executive officer of Hyderabad Goes Green, which supplies a range of eco-friendly products. ""Compared to last year, the demand has doubled. Many people placed bulk orders, with daily requests going from around 100 to more than 200 now. So far, at least 300 kilograms of organic colour have been sold and based on the number of enquiries, we are expecting at least 500 walk-ins on the eve of Holi,"" he added. Unable to manage the spike in demand this year, the firm set up five stalls in various locations to cater to customers, an official said.The switch to natural colours has also compelled other stores to stock up on them. DCube Designs, a city store, was not selling organic colours last year but they included it in their stocks when many people asked for it. Stores like Daaram too reported an increase in demand, with daily sales going up from five packs (a set of five colours) to 10 and bulk orders going up from three packs to six.For people like Bina Mehta, a dance instructor in the city, the better availability is a boon. ""I had to make natural colours at home earlier but now it is easily available. I am glad people are becoming more aware of the hazards of using ordinary colours which are laced with chemicals that are harmful to the environment and health,"" she said.Organic colours, which usually cost up to Rs 200, are made from natural ingredients like flowers and vegetables, say experts. For example, red and orange are made by mixing turmeric, vermillion and potatoes in varying proportions. Pink is made from rose powder and beetroot while green is made out of turmeric and indigo.Artificial colours, which are made from chemicals, pose a serious threat to soil and ground water, as well as skin and eyes, say city doctors. Every year, we get at least 10 cases of skin eruptions after Holi, said Dr Atul Rai, physician at Apollo Hospital in Jubilee Hills, who added that if the colours enter the eye or are ingested, it could lead to loss of sight or poisoning.Dr Y V Rao, a cosmetic surgeon in the city, further warned that prolonged exposure could result in serious ailments or even cancer. ""Organic colours should be promoted well and people should realize that anything natural would cause lesser harm to the body,"" he said.- Apply coconut oil on skin before playing Holi- In case of exposure to artificial colours, wash the area immediately- In case of irritation or rash, wash area thoroughly and apply calamine lotion- Consult a doctor immediately if artificial colour is ingested or goes into the eye"
61,Water scarcity compels shift in crop pattern,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/322846/water-scarcity-compels-shift-crop.html,2013-03-30,Deccan Herald,"Water scarcity compels shift in crop patternK Narasimhamurthy Kolar , Mar 31, 2013 DH News Service 2:15 ISTIncessant decline in groundwater levels in the district has forced authorities to advise farmers thrifty use of water. This, in turn, has led farmers to opt for a change in farm produce.The number of borewells going dry is increasing by the day, while those that still give water show little signs of surviving for long.As a result, many agriculturists who grow horticulture crops are leaving their land barren, unattended to.A few others, in contrast, have preferred to move from growing crops like tomato and potato to cultivating pumpkin, watermelon and pomegranate, which require much lesser water supply. Many farmers in Bangarpet and Malur taluks have already succeeded in this novel venture, and are beaming, proud to show such crops they have managed to grow.Change in produceI had grown pumpkin three years ago. Then, I grew tomato and potato once. Now, with such little water for the fields, I cannot grow either crop. As a result, I returned to growing pumpkin, as it takes far lesser water, said Hanumegowda, a farmer from Mangasandra in Kolar taluk.Speaking to the Deccan Herald correspondent and explaining the steps taken by him, Hanumegowda said, Every row of the tomato and potato crop needs ample watering. Also, the expenditure is high for the crops. About one acre of these two crops requires an investment of Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. In contrast, I need spend only about Rs 10,000 for the pumpkin crop.He added that the farmer can also save on transport if the crop is pumpkin. The vendors themselves come to our farms to pick up the loads of vegetables, he said, adding, The rate for one tonne of pumpkin is about Rs 8,000.ExpertspeakH Manjunath, assistant director of the Horticulture Department explained that another difference between growing pumpkin and growing tomato was the space taken up by the crops.The tomato rows are at a distance of about three feet. The saplings too are planted one-and-a-half to two feet away from each other. Pumpkin is grown in creepers and needs a distance of about three-and-a-half feet between the saplings, he said.The number of gourds is far lesser than the number of tomatoes per sapling, which is another reason for the lower level of water requirement, added Manjunath.GrantsThe assistant director, who concurred that many farmers in the district were moving towards crops that consumed lesser water, said the Department was already informed that the farmers growing pomegranate required financial assistance.There are many farmers in Manighatta in Kolar taluk as well as Tekal, Masti and Kenchapura in Malur taluk who are growing pomegranate. The produce too is expected to be pretty high this time, he said.In the backdrop of the fall in groundwater level in the borewells all over Kolar district, the farmers in the district are shifting from conventional crops to commercial crops. This is definitely a welcome change, Manjunath opined, adding, We just hope this will inspire more farmers to take up such options, as it will benefit not just them, but also the district as the pressure on the water supply via borewells will reduce considerably. Agricultural activity, however, will only continue as normal, unaffected."
62,"As banks in Cyprus falter, other tax havens step in",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/323154/as-banks-cyprus-falter-tax.html,2013-04-01,Deccan Herald,"As banks in Cyprus falter, other tax havens step inLIMASSOL (Cyprus), Apr 2, 2013, The New York Times : 22:09 ISTBloodied by a harsh bailout deal that drives a stake through the heart of this Mediterranean countrys oversize financial industry, Cyprus now faces a further blow to its role as an offshore tax haven: the vultures from competing territories are circling.With a flood of e-mails and phone calls in recent days to lawyers and accountants here who make a living from helping wealthy Russians and others avoid taxes, competitors in alternative financial centers across Europe and beyond are promoting their own skills at keeping money hidden and safe.We are aware of the economic problems facing Cyprus at the moment, read one such message from a law firm in Malta, also a euro zone member. We would like to propose an avenue of action for your consideration: offering corporate relocation to Malta, continued the business pitch, trumpeting Maltas low taxes and flexible yet robust regime for financial services.Similar unsolicited offers have originated in well-known havens like Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands, as well as in a host of other locations, including Dubai and Singapore. Even the northern part of Cyprus, controlled by Turkish Cypriots, has joined the feeding frenzy, promoting its own banks as a stable alternative to those run by Greek Cypriots in the crisis-racked southern part of the divided island. Particularly successful at luring Russians, Cyprus has built up a large infrastructure of lawyers, accountants and other professionals schooled in the arts of tax avoidance. Its corporate registry now has 3,20,000 registered companies, a staggering number for a country with only 8,60,000 people. Most are shells set up for foreign companies and wealthy individuals seeking to avoid taxes.We have been thrown to the wolves, and now the wolves have responded, said Nicholas Papadopoulos, head of the financial and budgetary affairs committee in Parliament. Bitterly critical of last weeks bailout deal  which is forcing Cyprus to shrink its banking and financial industry drastically and stick the largest bank depositors with much of the bill  Papadopoulos said the European Union was punishing a whole country just to hit Russians. Even if new controls in Cyprus make it impossible to move much capital elsewhere for the moment, rival havens are nonetheless intent on luring foreign-owned businesses that have been incorporated in Cyprus and might be happy to relocate.Mounting a counteroffensive is the Cyprus Fiduciary Association, an industry lobbying group. The banking sector is finished, but the service industry can survive, said the groups secretary, Andreas Marangos, a Limassol lawyer. Russians who now use Cyprus will open bank accounts elsewhere but might stick around for other offshore services, he said. The rush by rival havens could pose economic troubles as Cyprus struggles to keep afloat a financial industry that employs tens of thousands of people. Cypriot unemployment, already at 15 per cent, is expected to soar as the finance sector and the overall economy contract, aggravating a crisis that the bailout was intended to solve.Along with shipping, the financial industry is especially crucial here in Limassol, a port city popular with wealthy Russians looking for sun and a safe place to put their money.Cyprus, although only a relatively small player in a global network of low-tax financial centers, has made serving tax-averse foreigners a central pillar of its economy. A small sunny island whose main economic engine used to be potato farming, Cyprus shifted to a finance-centered model after Turkish troops took control of the northern part of the island in 1974.While Cyprus and its rivals dislike being described as tax havens and prefer to be known as offshore financial centers, those now picking at Cyprus carcass trumpet their ability to keep money beyond the reach of tax authorities. A Swiss company, the Gonthier Group, last week sent e-mails to Cyprus firms working with foreigners, suggesting they offer their clients a Swiss alternative, namely an investment vehicle which is extremely low-profile, not classified as a bank account or trust and thus very much under the radar of national fiscal authorities.Tilly Schneeberger Gonthier, a principal of the Montreux-based company, said on Sunday by telephone that her pitch was absolutely not an invitation to evade taxes, but merely an offer of a secure alternative to Cyprus-based investment vehicles. She denied wanting to hurt the Cypriot financial services industry.The New York TimesWe are trying to help them, Gonthier said. They have a lot of unhappy clients.She said that nobody in Cyprus had yet taken up her offer, but added: This doesnt happen very fast. It takes time.Papadopoulos, the parliamentary finance committee head, said he did not begrudge competitors in other locations trying to lure away clients rattled by his own countrys troubles. This is a zero-sum game, he said.Echoing a widespread view here, he complained that Cyprus had been unfairly singled out as a haven for shady money by the European Union even as others, including fellow members of the 27-nation bloc, provide much the same services.We have made mistakes, but the whole point of seeking help from the European Union was to get fair treatment, he said, referring to Cypruss request for a 10 billion euro lifeline from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund.A central demand of a bailout package announced early last Monday in Brussels, the headquarters of the unions bureaucratic apparatus, is that Cyprus dismantle its finance-dominated economic model.Cypriot banks gorged for years on deposits from overseas, especially Russia, and spewed out loans at such a rate that the banking sector ended up dwarfing the rest of the economy. Its total assets  now mostly loans of uncertain worth  grew to be eight times larger than the whole countrys economic output.But this imbalance is no worse than that in Malta, where the banking sector is also about eight times gross domestic product. And it is far less severe than in Luxembourg, where banking assets are more than 22 times GDP. Both Malta and Luxembourg, each a member of the European Union, last week loudly insisted they were very different from Cyprus  while their own financial service providers rushed to court Cypruss clients.How much success those countries have had at getting Russians and others to decamp is still unclear, although many lawyers here acknowledge that they have already helped a number of foreign clients open new bank accounts outside Cyprus. The countrys own banks, closed for nearly two weeks to prevent depositors from withdrawing all their cash, reopened last week but are now caught up in a web of capital controls that make most normal transactions all but impossible."
63,What the polls may bring,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130401/jsp/opinion/story_16716381.jsp,2013-04-01,Telegraph,"A Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance might win the elections in 2014 or earlier. What will the new governments policies be? The BJP has, over the 10 years in opposition to the United Progressive Alliance, taken many positions against its policies. Many of these may not easily be reversed when the BJP is in power. Earlier, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was able to smooth over such inconsistencies. He did this to the great benefit of India, memorably on two major policies. He followed whole-heartedly the economic reforms track of the P.V. Narasimha Rao government. He extended the hand of friendship and peace to Pakistan in spite of its aggressive talk and actions. But Vajpayee is not available and no one of his shrewdness, few words, stature and statecraft is around. Narendra Modi, Yashwant Sinha, Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj et al are lesser figures, with neither the same stature nor the articulation and clear objectives that put development and peace at the top. Among the BJPs old allies, perhaps Nitish Kumar might develop into a Vajapayee. But the BJP will not accept him, given the hostility between him and Modi. The BJP has been very aggressive in its rhetoric in responding to Pakistani actions and what it calls the timid responses of the UPA government. We must expect a more abrasive and aggressive stance in relation to Pakistan. Cross-border skirmishes will increase. The BJP will desperately look for muted military responses. Covert Indian operations might increase significantly within Pakistan. On the backburner will go a more relaxed visa regime, greater people-to-people contacts, more tourism and so on. Trade and investment are unlikely to grow. This is a pity since it could make for cheaper goods into Pakistan from India, greater access to natural resources from Baluchistan and other provinces and a share in the Iran gas pipeline. These non-events will hurt our economy. Bangladesh has already become a tale of missed opportunities, thanks to the obduracy of Mamata Banerjee and the extremism of Begum Khaleda Zia. A secure border with Bangladesh could control the huge migration into India. It would open the river route to the Northeast and enable its development, especially in getting natural resources out at low cost, and also energy. The BJP will be unable to pursue these initiatives, especially if Begum Zia and her supporters come to power later this year. This is a pity, since it would have added to our resources, brought costs down and helped develop the Northeast. Sri Lanka is one country regarding which the BJP has realized the inconsistency of fighting for Sri Lankan Tamils while wanting to safeguard our interests in Kashmir and elsewhere. Hopefully, it has grasped Vajpayees understanding of the encircling India strategy of China. The UPAs need for Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam support makes it sympathetic to DMK demands for mercy to Rajiv Gandhis assassins and for support to foreign nationals, which is how Tamils in Sri Lanka must be regarded. Vajpayee would not have allowed policies for the fractious relations with Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Maldives. The benefits of good relations with our South Asian neighbours lie in improved trade and investment. The BJP can stimulate this if it is able to cover its hostility to Muslims and Muslim countries in our region. The BJP in office was as ineffective as the UPA in gathering, analysing, sharing and acting quickly upon intelligence in dealing with terrorism  from Maoists, militants in Jammu and Kasmir and the Northeast. The BJP is more likely to impose restrictions on our Muslim population. This will disturb law and order, the economy, and equality of treatment to all citizens. The resulting pall of fear in Muslim localities is detrimental to internal peace and stability. Gujarat under Modi has shown that the Muslim bloodletting of 2002 cowed Muslim resistance to a Hindu-majority inclined government. It led to the absence of such law and order problems but no massive upsurge in Muslim wellbeing. This result could spread over the rest of India under a new BJP government. Vajpayees graciousness in dealing with the Gandhi family will be history. The BJP will now pursue its crimes. The various scams in telecommunications, coal, arms purchases and so on will be vigorously prosecuted. Unlike earlier governments, which had interminable commissions of inquiry, it may go to the courts. Todays high-profile ministers, Congress partymen and bureaucrats will have to defend themselves. Some dirty linen will fall out and hurt the Congress further, even if few cases are proven. This judicial hunt could lead to bureaucratic paralysis. The answer has been staring at us for decades  speedy administrative reforms. Detailed blueprints exist in the many reports of the administrative reforms commissions, especially those headed by Morarji Desai and Veerappa Moily. We must have bureaucratic accountability, speedy justice and administrative procedural reforms. The BJP has no ideological bias; unlike the Congress, whose close links to the bureaucracy prevented such reforms. Given the BJPs parliamentary behaviour in the last few years, the Congress will ensure similar turbulence. Little fresh legislation will be passed. Better led state-governments will initiate their own reforms. The states are at the heart of the poor implementation and theft of public funds. New national leaderships will emerge from this. In economic policies Vajpayee wisely continued Narasimha Raos liberalization (tax reforms and reductions, delicensing and so on). He added the stimulus of large infrastructure expenditures. A BJP-led government will build on public private partnerships pioneered by the UPA. Vajpayees innovative social welfare schemes, like mass education, went mad under the UPA, with huge corruption and fiscal deficits. The BJP might learn from this. The BJP in power did little to stimulate foreign direct investment. Nor did it try to change foreign institutional investment in equity into direct investment in new manufacturing. It did not close the loopholes of investments routed (free of capital gains tax) through Mauritius and other small countries, nor the invidious participatory notes. Both have become instruments for money laundering and volatility in the stock markets and exchange rates. Given the vested interests of politicians and the bureaucracy, this preference for FIIs may continue. Perhaps, however, the BJP has less to lose than the Congress and its friendly bureaucrats who amassed vast wealth overseas by these routes. If the BJP clamps down, volatility in markets and exchange rates will ease. This will stimulate both domestic and foreign investment. The BJP in Opposition was vociferously against FDI in retail and some other sectors. In office, it has to encourage and ease foreign fund inflows that are stable and not volatile, and in all sectors. But the partys attitudes for the last decade have to be reversed. A reversal is possible. After all, the BJP in earlier years was against foreign investment (yes to computer chips, no to potato chips) but relaxed on this when in the National Democratic Alliance. It will, when in power, see the need for it. The BJP will embark on a massive programme of privatization to release the resources locked into the public sector. It will also stimulate the economy as these dormant enterprises get fresh life and entrepreneurship from private ownership. As coal, oil and gas, power, steel, aluminum, tourism, perhaps even railways and airlines, become privatized we can expect a significant boost to the economy. These resources released from public enterprises must go into social expenditures on health, education, skills development, livelihoods enhancement, and not, as the Congress does, to bridge deficits. These social investments and infrastructure investments will stimulate the economy. The BJP in power might have brittle relations with neighbours. But it could, in economic policies, make India more responsive to enterprise and less so to bureaucratic procedures.

During financial year 2011-12, prices of some essentials rose by 16% to 142.86%.The report states that potato and onion prices changed by 142.86% and 119.05 % respectively during the period. ""During the year, a provision of Rs 2.50 crore was kept for market intervention to check the rising prices of essential commodities. However, it was observed that the entire amount remained unutilized at the end of the year,"" it notes.The department did not attempt to stop hoarding by dealers with raids and inspections, the report says, adding it was supposed to carry out at least 4,996 regular inspections but the enforcement branch conducted only 95 in the entire year.""Moreover the department failed to produce a single inspection report in support of the inspections claimed to have been conducted by it. Similar observation was made in the previous report with recommendation to conduct raids. Non-conducting of monthly inspections shows inaction on the part of department,"" the report says.The CAG also takes note of the inadequate complaints redress mechanism with there being no consolidated data to assess the number of complaints received at each level. It has slammed the department for lapses in identification of beneficiaries under various schemes of public distribution system.""The total number of cards increased from 17.6 lakh in April 2011 to 17.8 lakh in March 2012.

With children at home, we can't compromise on vegetables. So we have reduced the quantity. I supplement the nutrition levels with fruits,'' she said.Says Keerthi Akshay, an employee with a private company and who lives in Yadavgiri: With increased prices, I feel it is better to have a kitchen garden. As of now, reducing the quantity is the only alternative.''Vegetable prices have skyrocketed: Beans which used to cost Rs 40 per kg are now Rs 50 in Devaraja Market, Rs 55 in Big Bazaar and Rs 47 in Hopcoms. Carrots which used to be available at Rs 30 per kg till a couple of weeks ago, now range between Rs 40 and Rs 47. Similarly, ladies finger which used to cost around Rs 30/kg now ranges between Rs 35 and Rs 47 in various markets and supermarkets. Barring tomato which is available at around Rs 10 per kg, the price of most vegetables has gone up. However, there is not much fluctuation in the price of potato or onion.The prices have gone up due to low yield, thanks to acute shortage of groundwater level and severe power shortage in villages, said MS Raju, assistant director of horticulture.Vegetables are largely grown in Varuna hobli, Megalapura, Keelanapura, Dootagrama and Kesare in Mysore taluk, Hampapura in HD Kote taluk, KR Nagar taluk and in Hebbal. More farmers have started growing short-term crops like tomato, beans, cabbage, radish and beetroot in the region.Raju told TOI: ""Price depends on climatic conditions. With no rainfall in the city, the prices have soared. But this is the best price for farmers. The price encourages them to grow more vegetables.""Apart from people, the rise in vegetable prices in the district has affected vegetable sellers at Devaraja Market. Supply at the market has not decreased. Wholesale traders are selling beans, carrot and ladies finger at Rs 40/kg and above.Siddiqui, a vegetable vendor at Devaraja market, said: ""People purchase vegetables in small quantity when prices increase. Prices are expected to remain the same till monsoon.""Increase in vegetable prices is forcing people to cut down on quantity or not buy the more expensive ones like carrot or beans. This may lead to loss in nutrients in the body which are very essential in summer. Loss of nutrition due to sweat is common during summer. Vitamin C is more in vegetables like carrot and beans.

Going by this figure, almost two lakh babies every year are born with CHD, of whom 75% die before their first birthday. The rate of deaths is high as the disease is not diagnosed on time. If diagnosed on time, most of these children can be saved, said experts during a two-day continuing medical education (CME) on ""Recent Advances in Cardiac Surgery"", organised by the department of cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, King George's Medical University (KGMU) on Friday.Though the doctors could not provide an estimate of number of children suffering from CHD in UP, they said that the new advanced methods are a boon for treating CHD affected babies. President, Indian Association of Cardiothoracic Surgeons (IACTS), Prof Bhabatosh Biswas said, ""With advanced methods, CHD is now curable.''According to doctors, CHD is a defect in the structure of heart and vessels at birth. The symptoms of CHD are respiratory problems, babies turning blue and heart murmur (sound produced by heart due to blood flow). Doctors said that not only genetical factors result in CHD but uncontrolled level of sugar in diabetic mothers, illness of mothers or any infection caused during pregnancy can also lead to CHD in neonatals. Doctors advised that children suffering from CHD should eat more of fish, unpolished rice and cut down the intake of potato and sweets.On the occasion, experts also spoke about cadaver heart transplant and artificial heart transplant. Dr Balakrishnan from Chennai said, ""Through operation, an artificial heart is implanted in the body. The wire cables of artificial heart are connected to the battery. The wire cables are hidden inside the clothes of patient and batteries are kept inside a small bag which the patient has to carry every time with him or her.'' Heart implantation is presently restricted to metros in India but would soon begin in other cities."

On Saturday, farmers at a Dhupguri market threw away 12 quintals of tomatoes after wholesalers offered them 25 paisa a kilo.""It costs Rs 1,200 to cultivate tomato on one bigha land and the yield is 600kg at the most. The production cost for every kilo is Rs 20,"" said Bikas Roy, a farmer.""The easiest way for farmers is to avail loans from money lenders. Cooperative banks have also been slow in disbursing loans to them,"" said Kuldip Maity, MD and CEO of Village Financial Services, a microfinance institution.His statement tallies with that of agriculture secretary Subrata Biswas, who said: ""There has been a credit squeeze in the banking system in the recent past. We have seen a drop in timely credit disbursal for farmers. But there has neither been any drop in productivity nor in demand for credit.""Moneylenders and microfinance institutions are filling the huge gap in demand for credit and disbursals, said Madan Ghosh, president of West Bengal Pradeshik Krishak Sabha. ""Many farmers are not interested in bank loans as crop insurance is mandatory if they avail institutional credit,"" he added. ""Had there been a compensation for crop insurance premiums, farmers would have been more interested.""The squeeze in institutional credit along with the problem of over production and market availability has put the farmers in a trap that is tightening its grip. In a limited market, brokers are turning out to be tormentors instead of facilitators, say experts. Fifty syndicates control the auction of perishable commodities in North Bengal, leaving farmers no say in determining prices.""Last year when we were selling tomatoes for one rupee a kilo, they were retailing at Rs 12. Middlemen were making all the money. This year, it's worse. It wouldn't have been so if there were more cold storages and packaging facilities,"" said Md Asraful, a farmer.Brokers, however, pass the blame on farmers. ""We do not control the market. Demand rises and falls with price. Farmers increase production to make more profit. Naturally, the price will come down,"" said Ashok Sarkar, a broker with RKS syndicate."

74, Crackdown on potato investment scheme ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130411/jsp/business/story_16772368.jsp,2013-04-11,Telegraph,"Calcutta, April 10: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today ordered Bengal-based agri-marketing firm Sumangal Industries not to raise money from the public by issuing bonds based on the purchase of potatoes. The market regulator has asked the firm to reply within 15 days and barred it from diverting or alienating any assets or funds till the issue of further orders. The city-based firm is engaged in the business of buying and storing potatoes with the money raised through the issue of bonds and then selling them at a higher price later. Sumangal Industries has to be prevented from carrying on further with its activity related to the collective investment scheme without obtaining due registration from Sebi in accordance with law, Sebi said in an order. The company has been directed not to launch any other collective investment scheme without Sebis approval. Under the Flexi Potato Purchase Scheme, investors are assured guaranteed return of 20-100 per cent within 15 months from the purchase date. The minimum investment is Rs 5,000. The regulator observed that the company had been issuing bonds with a buyback offer promising returns of 15.6 per cent per annum. The scheme appears to satisfy all the attributes of a collective investment scheme as defined under Section 11AA (2) (i) to (iv) of the Sebi Act. 1992, Sebi said in its order. It is also noted that the company merely has a trade licence from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to supply food items, vegetables, spices and beverages, the order said. Sumangal officials were not available for comment. In October, Sebi had informed the company that no entity could carry on, sponsor or launch a collective investment scheme without obtaining a certificate from it. It had asked the company to submit certain documents to obtain the registration certificate. Sumangal had said it had a licence to trade in potatoes and was dealing in agricultural and non-agricultural products both within and outside India. The company had denied operating a collective investment scheme and said the question of obtaining a certificate from Sebi did not arise."

With monotonic regularity,companies offer people the chance to invest in goats,pigs,emu and teak wood and now potatoes,offering absurd levels of returns for their efforts.On Wednesday,Sebi stopped a bid by a West Bengal company,Sumangal Industries,to float an unregistered and dubious potato bond scheme that promised returns ranging from 20 to 100 per cent.Its modus operandi: funds collected from public will be used to buy potatoes from the market on behalf of the investors when the price is low and preserve them in cold storage and later on sell them when the market price rises. It claimed a guarantee of 20 per cent to 100 per cent profit recoverable in a cycle of 15 months.In December,Sebi had asked MPS Greenery Developers,again from Bengal to close its scheme and refund Rs 1,520 crore to the investors within a month. MPS planned to mobilise Rs 30,000 crore from the public a re-run of the unravelling Sahara bonds offer.Earlier last year,it was the arrest of Susi Emu Farm chairman MS Guru in Tamil Nadu whose assurance ofa monthly income of more than Rs 6,000 per investors,made news.The payments had dried up and police came calling instead as fresh investors became rare and so the cash with the promoters to pay off the older fellows vanished.The reason why the schemes still sprout is the absence of clarity on who will police them.The financial sector regulators or Parliament have not drawn up solutions. The latter is worried about encroachments on state powers,so it is most commendable that UK Sinhas team has taken it upon themselves to bring faith in the regulators and belief in a regulated financial sector.George is a senior editor based in Mumbai.george.mathew@expressindia.comFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

79,Those were the days,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Those-were-the-days/articleshow/19607322.cms,2013-04-18,The Times Of India,"Potato crisps in glittering packets are a delight to crunch on and labelled red apples are good for a munch, but our elders may have been luckier in savouring healthier wild berries off the bushes. They neither needed any processing nor packaging.The fruity delicacies, ranging from the kandam and ansalim to churnam and konneram, can still be plucked in some pockets directly and relished for their wholesome content and generally sweet taste.A wide variety from the fruit basket helped our elders use the resource sustainably for their consumption. But though Goa is a biodiversity hotspot, the traditional knowledge is sadly fading.Changing tastes and lifestyles in a highly urbanized setting, investment trends and market demands have taken a heavy toll of our cultural ethos. ""It would be interesting to find out what our elders were eating three generations back, apart from the commonest fruits like bananas, and before the introduction of apples and oranges,"" says M K Janarthanam, head of the botany department at the Goa University.Exploring the forests and patches of green areas for organic food was once a joyful experience for local populations with a few pastimes and occupations. ""As young children, we waited for the exciting summer months and roamed the fields, jungles, sloppy hills, narrow rivulets and rocky cliffs. We used these as adventure spots and frequent hunting grounds of wild fruits and berries,"" says Jayarama Bhat, a botanistAvailability of multifarious forms of entertainment has also dimmed our instinct for outdoor adventure. ""Basically, we have lost our capabilities as hunters in finding our food (fruits). What we want now are readymade things available in the market,"" Janarthanam says.The present generation is aware of kiwis, cherries, strawberries and other exotic fruits, though these are not cultivated here, but many are not exposed to the local fruit heritage. The exploration and adventure taught several skills to the youth. ""ln a way, it was a great learning of not only about fruits but also as an art of tree-climbing, rock-cliff climbing, swimming and other activities,"" reminisces Bhat.The consumption of fruits, as also vegetables, is finally dictated by the market and huge investment. Says Janarthanam, ""Ultimately, it is true that marketing and big money determines what you are supposed to eat.""In the bargain, this factor determines what should be available in the market. ""Our local heritage (fruits) have lost out in the process,"" says Janarthanam. The sale of local fruits by the roadside under dusty conditions may be a deterrent for passers by to purchase.Growing wild on the hillside or small or big patches of forested areas near urban or rural places, these local fruits are purely organic and need neither pesticides nor fertilizers. The joy and fun lie in exploring, sourcing and eating these freely available fruits.But some of the plant species are slowly disappearing from the hill sides and plateaus. ""I haven't seen much of red kuntata (Eugenia caryophyllea) or belsam as it's called in Konkani these days,"" says Bhat. The bushy plants later grow to small-sized trees and produce red-coloured fruits.The spread of the suffocating eupatorium species of weed, locally known as ranmari, has also checked the growth of other plants.The sight of colourful wild berries in green foliage not only delighted and energized locals but also sustained the feed for several bird species. ""They play an important role in frugivorous birds,"" says Janarthanam. The ripening of chun'nam at the Goa University has turned the campus into fruit fest venue for birds.The important non-timber forest produce in the form of fruits helps locals in areas near forests and thickets avail their nutrients. Villagers from nearby areas harvest the wild berries on Bambolim plateau and sell them in nearby markets.Areas in the suburbs of Panaji, such as Socorro, Pilerne and Salvador do Mundo, once had plenty of wild fruits and berries, but rapid urbanization has shrunk the cover of fruit trees. The Verna bypass is one such spot where locals help continue the tradition of sourcing and selling the produce.""They collect the fruits before the sun rises and reach the bypass by 8am,"" says horticulturist, Daniel D'Souza. The produce fetches better value as prices have jumped up. ""A parcel is sold for 20 now as compared to 5 a few years back,"" he adds.The issue of this dying heritage and knowledge worries environmentalists. Identifying the gaps in inventorizing the state's biodiversity, a steering committee of experts had stated, ""Except for higher plants, mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, crabs, bivalves and gastropods, there is no good inventory on other taxonomic groups. Even basic data, such as their name and their presence in Goa, is not available.""The steering panel which had been formed under national biodiversity strategy and action plan (NBSAP) had suggested documentation and dissemination of details about traditional practices and knowledge with a focus on their economic and conservation value. But the government is yet to act on it."

A prolonged dry spell has hit the cultivation and the prices are far higher than what they normally are in April, say vendors.The increase is in the range of 20 per cent to 30 per cent. The price of green peas, beans and ginger has crossed Rs. 100 a kg.The sudden increase in price of beans and ginger has surprised us. While beans is being sold around Rs. 120 a kg, the price of ginger is around Rs. 100, Gowri R., a retail vegetable vendor in Thippasandra, said.Though the price of green peas had crossed Rs. 100 a kg a couple of years ago, it was for the first time that the price of beans and ginger had gone above Rs. 100. Ginger was being sold at Rs. 40 a kg last year. The prices started increasing last week because of short supply. However, this is not preventing customers from buying vegetables, she said, adding that they could go up further.On Wednesday, the price of carrot was Rs. 60 a kg, up from Rs. 40 last week. Similarly, the price of potato has gone up from Rs. 20 a kg to Rs. 30, and that of tomato went up from Rs. 15 to Rs. 20. The price of cucumber has doubled in one week to Rs. 30 a kg and you need to shell out Rs. 15 for a bunch of coriander leaves.However, the price of onion has remained at Rs. 20 a kg. Incidentally, onion cost Rs. 50 a kilo last year when exports triggered a price rise in domestic market.According to A.M. Mustaq, a vegetable vendor at Russell Market, the lack of availability of water following scanty rainfall had affected vegetable cultivation. Even the quality of vegetables such as cauliflower, cucumber and tomato was not good, he added.The price rise has left Mohan Murthy, a daily wage labourer, in a helpless situation. Half of what I earn a day is being spent on groceries. My wife cannot take up a job as she is not well. I have three children.

83,The CAD bogeyman,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/328719/cad-bogeyman.html,2013-04-26,Deccan Herald,"Bharat Jhunjhunwala 23:48 ISTSarkari economists could be rejoicing over rising CAD, going by their enthusiasm to boost it through higher foreign investments.The buzz among sarkari economists these days is that India's current account deficit (CAD) is getting dangerous. Our exports are less, imports more and the gap is widening. We need to attract more foreign investments to bridge the gap. It is forgotten though that more foreign investments necessarily mean an increase in CAD.The straightforward way to dealing with increasing CAD would be to devalue the rupee -- which would make our exports competitive and imports expensive. Increase in CAD means that demand for dollars for imports will outstrip supply of dollars from exports.The high demand for dollars would translate into an increase in price of the dollar, and corresponding decline in price of the rupee. This, in turn, would lead to an increase in exports. A balance between imports and exports would be re-established at a new level. For example, high demand for potatoes in the wholesale market leads to increase in price and balance is soon re-established between arrivals and sales. The shortage is wiped out. The same should happen in the forex market and CAD should be wiped out in normal course of business.So, why pray, should rising CAD worry us? The market will ensure that CAD is wiped out. We must be worried because the matter is intertwined with foreign investments and liquidity in our money market.Dollars come into our forex market not only from exports but also from foreign investments. It is not necessary for shortfall in export earnings to be met by increase in exports. It can also be met from increased inflows of foreign investments. The simple formula is Exports + Foreign Investments = Imports.The above formula can be rewritten as Imports  Exports = CAD = Foreign Investments. This means that CAD is inevitable as long as we have foreign investment inflows.To go back to the potato example, it is not necessary that daily receipts of potatoes from the farmers be equal to daily sale. Stocks held in cold storage can also be sold. In that case, the deficit between daily receipts and sale will be equal to the withdrawals from cold storage. It will not be possible to wipe out shortage in daily supplies as long as sales from cold storage take place. Similarly, CAD arises only when inflows of Foreign Investments edge out export earnings.We must understand the mainstream concern about increasing CAD against this background. If increasing CAD really worries us, we should look at curtailing foreign investment flows. A reduced inflow of dollars will lead to the rupee declining against the dollar. That will translate into higher exports and wipe out the CAD.The interesting part is that our sarkari economists also want to maintain high inflow levels of foreign investments. This is contradictory for, as shown above, CAD = Foreign Investments. Increase in Foreign Investments has to necessarily lead to an increase in CAD. We cannot have the cake and eat it too.The Sarkari wayIt appears that sarkari economists are only shedding crocodile tears on increasing CAD. The truth appears to be quite different. They are actually happy with inflow of foreign investments and rising CAD. And, their concerns are primarily about hiding the impact of rising CAD on the domestic economy, exporters in particular. The consequence of a rising CAD in the normal course of business is that the rupee will devalue. That would boost our exports. So far, so good. However, the real problem is that a devaluation of the rupee will scare away foreign investors.The sarkari economists do not want this to happen because inflows of foreign investments increase liquidity in the money markets, making it possible for the government to borrow larger amounts at low interest rates. Note that the government has recently increased the ceiling on government bonds purchased by foreign investors.The sarkari economists main concern is to garner monies for supporting corruption and buying votes. They are following Charvakas philosophy: Take a loan and make merry. The ability of the government to take loans at low interest rates is dependent on inflows of foreign investments; hence.they are loath to let the rupee devaluate. And, CAD has to necessarily be large if rupee is to be maintained at a artificially high level. Thats why they are happy with the increase in CAD. But they do not want the public to fathom this intention because that will lead to a hue and cry from exporters. Hence, they shed crocodile tears that they are worried about CAD.Analyst assessments, including my own, is that the correct value of the rupee today will be about Rs 70 to a dollar considering the differential rate of inflation in the USA and India. Sarkari economists are trying to keep the rupee artificially high so that foreign investors are not scared away.What should be done? The solution is to increase investments in infrastructure and research. Assuming we receive $10 billion in foreign investments, let the government make a matching investment in infrastructure with imported capital goods. That will leave the balance between our exports and imports unchanged. The capital receipts from foreign investments can be used to finance capital expenditures in infrastructure without incurring further debt. Are the sarkari economists listening?"
84,Wealth tax had forced farmer to sell land,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/Wealth-tax-had-forced-farmer-to-sell-land/articleshow/19793701.cms,2013-04-30,The Times Of India,"JALANDHAR: Imposition of wealth tax had forced a leading potato seed grower, who also pioneered the concept of seed certification in the region, to sell off his land in Jalandhar. This was because the tax was more than his income and he purchased land in rural Haryana to prevent further draining of his financial sources.Harvinder Singh, whose late father Tara Singh was a leading grower of potato seeds and a pioneer in potato seed certification, said before selling the land in 2008, they had paid Rs 20 lakh as wealth tax for the six acre land in Basti Peer Baad area. Their 'TS' brand potato seeds are known across the country.He revealed that in 2002, the I-T officials asked his father to pay wealth tax and they assessed it from 1999. ""We fought legally but the income tax tribunal, high court and then Supreme Court held that I-T officials were correct in literal interpretation of the Wealth Tax Act On Urban Land. Till 2008, we paid around Rs 20 lakh for nine years while for the same period, return from the farm land was around Rs 18 lakh,"" said Harvinder.""While purchasing the land near Gurgaon in Haryana, we took care that it should not be within 8km of the municipal limits so that we would not come under the purview of wealth tax,"" Harvinder pointed out.At present, the collector rate (the minimum rate fixed by DC to register the sale deed) in Basti Peer Baad is Rs 1.80 crore and minimum annual wealth tax, after taking exemption of Rs 30 lakh into consideration, would compute to Rs 1.50 lakh per acre which is much above the return in agriculture."
85,Sack Attorney General now and Law Minister next week if indicted….but please don’t mix issues,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-real-truth/sack-attorney-general-now-and-law-minister-next-week-if-indicted-but-please-don-t-mix-issues/,2013-05-01,The Times Of India,"The Supreme Courts caustic comments against the Government call for some serious action. What the court has clearly established is that there was perjury committed. On the face of it, the perjury was committed by the ASG Harin Raval, and he has already quit. But what the ASG has said is equally important. Going by his letter (which the SC may want to check), the AG is guilty of perjury as well. If thats established, he should quit or be sacked as well. However, lets not mix issues here. There is no comment on Ashwani Kumar directly. Nor on the policy of administered allocations. Nor on any cases of corruption. The BJP is exulting as if the order was about all this!As usual, the hullaballoo in the media today about the SCs comments is misplaced. The SC has not indicted Ashwani Kumar. It has actually indicted the CBI for following the instructions of imagined, unauthorized bosses. Clearly after the Vineet Narain judgement delivered by the SC 15 years back, the CBI should have known that if at all (and really there was no reason here), it could have shared the report with its boss, the DoPT. But under no circumstances could it have done so with the Minister of Law. The CBI is clearly on thin ice here. The slap on its wrists could turn into a full blown demand for the resignation of the CBI Director as well, if the SC opines that he knowingly failed to fulfil this obligation. For now, thats not the case, but I am sure more will emerge on this front in the days to come.Like mentioned earlier, Ashwani Kumar has so far not been directly brought into the line of the SCs fire. He was clearly out of line, but his defence can be that even if he was, the CBI could have resisted sharing the report. After all, nothing can stop anyone from making an illegal demand, but that by itself cannot be construed as being a crime.However, things could change dramatically next week when the CBI Director responds on what specific changes were made by Ashwani Kumar and the two bureaucrats from the PMO and the coal ministry. If there has been a material change in the CBIs report, then all hell will break loose and Ashwani Kumar will have to rightfully go. But if the changes were minor ones, the developments will depend on what the SC feels about them. If it remains caustic, Ashwani Kumar will have to go. But if its lenient, then Ashwani Kumar may well get away with a light slap on his wrists.The media hullaballoo is also wrong for one other reason. The SC has not ruled on the scam itself. There is not even a comment on that, leave alone an indictment. No one is guilty of anything yet. Its still a political issue, with the jury out on whether the Congress was right in continuing with the policy of administered allocations. Honestly, thats not even for the SC to judge. Thats a policy matter which Parliamentarians should decide on. And they hav already decided  in a political way! The Kalyan Banerjee (TMC) headed committee has blamed everyone from 1993 onwards, including the BJP when it ruled for six years! TMC being more left that the Left itself, the report is not surprising, considering the period of the report overlaps with the period of economic reforms initiated in 1991. The TMC cannot stand reforms!Even in the 2G case, the SC eventually had to overturn the order of its 2-judge bench that all natural resources should only be auctioned. If the government had appealed the cancelation of the 2G licenses, it is possible the SC would have overturned that too, but the government chose not to, maybe inspired by the opportunity to milk the telecom industry and balance its fiscally distraught balance sheet (and we blame the Government for not being hungry for revenues????!). The SC has only argued against lack of transparency in issuance of 2G licenses, and such issues. In the coal case also, it is not for the SC to decide whether administered allocations are better or auctions.Likewise, it is no business of the CAG to decide whether administered allocations are better or auctions. The CAG is a much discredited agency thanks to its freaky understanding of economics!It is the CBI that has to investigate cases of corruption. So far, both the BJP and the Congress stand accused in the 11 FIRs filed by the CBI. Makes me wonder what Ashwani Kumar was up to. Was he trying to protect more Congress names from popping up? Was he trying to deflect blame from the PM who ran the coal policy for many years? Or was he trying to get the CBI to include more BJP names in its reports? After all, the 11th FIR was against a company that got its mines after a recommendation from Raman Singh, the BJP CM of Chhatisgarh. Well know the facts soon!But politically, the coal scam has become a hot potato again. The BJP has seized it as a handy excuse (excuse, since it would have blocked Parliament in any case) to stop legislative work, hurting national interests but helping its political cause. The Congress has again been put on the backfoot and denied the glory that continuously dropping inflation, interest rates and petrol prices could otherwise have shone on it. Its a cat and mouse game. Someday the BJP gets the upper hand; someday the Congress. But for gods sake, dont mistake this to be the denouement of any criminal case. Thats still years away. And the truth is still not out.The real truth is that the PM must do what hes promised. Take action after reading the SCs comments. For now, the AG must go. Maybe next week, depending on what the SC says, the CBI Director and the Law Minister may have to go as well. The PM should worry more about his legislative agenda  and stay focused on that. We the people in the meantime should be careful not to mix issues."
86,No need for speed,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/no-need-for-speed/,2013-05-02,Indian Express,"Algorithmic trading hits yet another bumpThe Twitter feed of the Associated Press was hacked last week and a false post about Barack Obama being injured pulled down the Dow,momentarily shaving $136 billion off the market. The power of social media,it was reported,had extended beyond politics to influence markets. This appeared to be a reasonable conclusion because the incident occurred after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had allowed companies to share market-relevant announcements over Twitter and Facebook on April 2. But consider the time-frame of the incident: four minutes from slide to recovery. No human can evaluate a breaking story that fast and initiate or cancel trades accordingly. What the incident actually revealed was the rise of the machines on the trading floor.Algorithm-based high-frequency trading is not the same as playing old-world stock exchanges. Exclusively electronic and focused on speed,it gains leverage by cutting out the human factor from decision-making. It is driven by algorithms which use the vast volumes of data that modern trading operations generate and evaluate it in ways and at speeds that humans cannot. Computers may relinquish and regain positions several times per second,creating hot potato volumes in trading. The mechanics are poorly understood since algo traders are generally tight-lipped about technicals,but it produces glitches that unambiguously suggest that the markets are no longer for mere mortals,only for specialists who can access heavy-duty computing and bulk data.The Twitter post was the second big glitch. The first warning was the flash crash of May 6,2010,when aggressive selling by algo traders,in response to a big sale by a mutual fund,had tipped over a market worried about the Greek debt crisis. The day before,there had been protests in the Acropolis in Athens and gold had hit a record high. Trading machines had reacted to uncertainty conservatively,dropping their positions and exiting the market. They are programmed to have better sense than some human traders,but the exit of machines in a flock had exacerbated the negative human sentiment prevailing in markets that day. But again,the crisis had developed and passed in minutes,while regulators spent almost five months pondering the forensics.Regulators have been concerned about microsecond trading since last August,when a glitch caused $440 million losses to Knight Capital. In February,the US SEC had prescribed regular checkups for exchanges and trading platforms to see that they maintained technical standards and redundancy mechanisms. The agency will also trawl market data to anticipate flash crashes,or at least produce better forensic reports.But this is merely symptomatic treatment that avoids fundamental questions. This week,a parallel forum is raising them  the currency markets. EBS (Electronic Broking Services),one of the worlds biggest currency trading platforms,is telling its clients that speed doesnt matter. The preferred platform for trades involving the dollar,the Euro,the yen and the Swiss franc,it had moved early to facilitate high-frequency trading. But now,it has observed that first-come-first-served trading disproportionately advantages firms that invest in faster computers and thicker data pipes,encouraging a digital arms race. In fact,firms that are physically located closer to markets also have a slight edge in the transmission time of orders. Since competition in trading should be generated by strategy rather than speed,EBS wants to process orders not serially but in batches that are shuffled like a deck of cards. A lottery every millisecond is not the most elegant solution,but at least it would end the monomaniacal pursuit of speed.Flash crashes are made possible by high-frequency trading,but social media do have an impact. However,the use of Twitter in taking market decisions is not new. Markets have always been mindful of the news,which is why pink papers have political correspondents. Now,when even journalists are reading Twitter feeds instead of the wires,it is not exactly radical for market players to follow suit. It is the fastest news channel ever. It is self-correcting like regular news,offering all versions of a story,but it is prey to the common internet flaw of bubbling  you live in a sensory bubble where you are more likely to see posts that confirm your beliefs rather than contrary opinion.The coverage of the manhunt for the Boston marathon bombers,which was crowdsourced using social media,suggests that reporters understand the phenomenon. Reddit was quick to blame a missing Indian who,inconveniently enough,was later found to be dead; formal media was careful to air only attributable opinions. But perhaps traders arent as hard-nosed as reporters. Last August,a fake Twitter post attributed to Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev had alleged that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad had been killed or injured,and the prices of crude were immediately affected. Perhaps traders need to teach their algorithms to be wary about Twitter truths.pratik.kanjilal@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
87,Home budgets hit as vegetable prices soar with rising mercury,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/Home-budgets-hit-as-vegetable-prices-soar-with-rising-mercury/articleshow/19904189.cms,2013-05-06,The Times Of India,"KANPUR: The first week of May ended with a temperature of 43 degree Celsius on Sunday, around 1.2 degree higher than that of Saturday. The people remained indoors till sunset. Hot conditions would continue to prevail.Day temperature continues to go up across the region with mercury touching 43 degrees Celsius mark at many places. This is also the highest maximum temperature recorded so far this summer.The minimum temperature also rise to 20.3 degrees. The humidity in morning was 35% which reduced to 19% in afternoon. According to meteorologists of Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology, possibility of respite in near future is bleak.The bad news is that the mercury is unlikely to come down. It will remain high for about two to three days, as the cooling effect of the winds is missing. But the nights will provide some relief as the sky is clear. There is no moisture and no cloud cover.Meanwhile, the prices of several types of vegetables have skyrocketed with the advent of summer. This has created a serious problem for the people. Prices of potato and onion have increased in both retail and whole sale market and vegetables are now stretching the budgets of average households.The potatoes available for around Rs 10 for 1.5 kg are now being sold between Rs 12 and Rs 15 per kg. The price of onion, which was at Rs 16 rupees per kg sometime back, is at Rs 20 at present.Similar is the scene with seasonal vegetable as well. Bitter guard is being sold in the market at Rs 30 to 35 per kg while the ladyfinger is at Rs 25 per kg.""Normally, in summer we have snake guard, bottle guard and ladyfinger in abundance. However, the production has not been as high this season because of excessive rainfall in winters. Supply has been about 30% short and this has led to hike in prices,"" said a wholesaler at Chakarpur Mandi.Vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, carrot and tomato are also costly. Vegetables like pumpkin and drumsticks are also soaring due to less production.According to the vegetable wholesalers at Awas Vikas Mandi, the supply of potato and onion has not been affected. They are getting about 22 truckloads of potato and onion now, against the 25 earlier. However, most of these vegetables are being bought by cold storage owners and very little goes into the retail market, hence inflating the prices for commoners. Another wholesaler said: ""Prices of vegetables will continue to be on the higher side for another month.""This winter, around 160 mm of rainfall was received. It was five times higher the average rainfall is of 30 mm. The heavy rainfall has destroyed the vegetable crops in the region. The rest of the crop was disturbed due to fluctuating temperatures in the past month.A housewife in Kidwai Nagar said: ""I have started using pulses for evening meals."" 'Chhole, rajma and soya chunks are the alternatives due to soaring vegetable prices. The worse hit are the people who have weddings at their homes.""The menu of my daughter's wedding comprises vegetable pasta and vegetable fillers. The soaring prices of vegetables had increased my budget,"" said Mayank, a local resident."

The aam admi is feeling the pinch as the cost of vegetables has gone up immensely compared to last month. The most shocking change in price is that of French beans which has doubled in less than a month.What was once 40 could now cost you up to 80 per kg. ""Many customers keep pestering us about the sudden rise in prices. It is not in our hands because this inevitable rise is due to the summer season,"" says Adil Shaikh, a vendor from SGPDA market in Margao.Vegetables like ginger and cucumber have also risen radically this summer. Ginger has also doubled from 70 to 120 per kg, while the price of cucumber has increased from 24 to 40 per kg.""The price rise is crossing my daily budget and this affects the monthly expenditure. We have to resort to buying cheaper varieties of vegetables,"" said Josephine D'Souza from Panaji.The prices of cauliflower and garlic have risen by 15 and 10, respectively. So much so, the humble green chilly is also dearer by 8 from the previous price of 32 per kg. The cost of carrots and brinjals has increased by about 6 per kg, while the price of coriander has gone up by 5 per bundle.The common problem farmers face during summer is the shortage of water which affects crop growth. ""This price hike happens almost every year during April and May as it is the driest period of the year. So there is a usual fluctuation in prices, but it comes back to normal by June-July,"" said Heerabai, a vendor at the Panaji market.The costs of other vegetables like tomatoes, onions, potatoes and cabbage which are used on a regular basis have increased by around 3-4 per kg. There is also a demand for local vegetables like tambdi bhaji, lady finger, etc. as they are easier on the pocket."
89,"Stop selling substandard potatoes, traders told",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/stop-selling-substandard-potatoes-traders-told/article4697939.ece,2013-05-09,The Hindu,"Administration has ordered traders to completely stop the sale of substandard potatoes coloured up by synthetic colours and clay in the city within one week.Berhampur Sub-Collector Bijay Kumar Das has called up the potato traders of the city for a meeting regarding allegations that traders have again started selling sub-standard potatoes in the city market despite earlier directive by the administration against it. The meeting was also attended by officials of the Civil Supplies Department.Speaking to The Hindu , the Sub-Collector said the potato traders were warned of administrative action if they did not stop selling substandard potatoes.A special squad will be formed to check the sale of substandard potatoes. President of Ganjam Chamber of Commerce will be a member of the squad as representative of the traders, the Sub-Collector said.It may be noted that since more than a decade potato traders were supplying only substandard potatoes in the city market. Irony was that customers of the city had no scope to complain due to unavailability of good quality potatoes in Berhampur market to compare.The traders used to sell the substandard potatoes at the price of better quality potatoes sold at other places in the State. The substandard potatoes procured at low price are mostly low quality or slightly rotten potatoes.To hide the deformities, holes and unhealthy pigmentation of these substandard potatoes very fine clay called Ela Mitti and most of the time even cheap synthetic colours are used. The deep holes in the potatoes are filled up with clay.Colour and clayAccording to customers, one kg of such potatoes contain around 150 grams of colour and clay. Unless the potatoes are cleaned properly, this clay and synthetic colour can prove to be harmful for consumers.Addressing to the complains of consumer former, the administration on February 7 passed an order to potato traders to exhaust their stock of substandard potatoes by February 15 and procure only good quality potatoes after that.After this order, substandard potatoes had vanished from Berhampur market for around two months.

Traders have further jacked up prices for retail consumers as they are able to earn profits quickly with the bulk sale of vegetables for marriage parties. Tomatoes which were available for Rs.20 per kg are now priced at Rs.40. Cost of brinjal has also been doubled within two weeks.With the shortfall of crop in Gara, Srikakulam and other mandals, brinjals are being sold at Rs.40 per kg and lady fingers are available at Rs.35 per kilo.Carrots per kilo cost has gone up to Rs.50 from Rs.40. Onions are now available at Rs.18 per kg and potatoes are priced at Rs.16. The prices of other types of vegetables have also skyrocketed with the advent of summer.Traders say that the prices of potatoes and onions are likely to go up further in the retail market with the shortfall of their production in Maharashtra, West Bengal and other States. Vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, carrot and tomato come in huge quantities from various mandals of Srikakulam district.. However, against the average daily supply of 25 truckloads, supply has now come down to 15 truckloads a day.Compared to vegetables, fruits are available at reasonable prices. A kilo mangoes are priced at Rs.30 and sapotas are available at Rs.25 in Potti Sriramulu Market.The government should intervene immediately to stabilise prices of vegetables.

In fact, vendors say that if the districts do not get a good rainfall in the coming days, the prices may shoot up further and some vegetables may even become scarce.Usually, prices of vegetables go up during the marriage seasons in Madurai and the southern districts. Even though there is an increase, it is somewhere around Rs 10 or slightly higher than its normal pricing. However, on Sunday, the prices were even higher than that of the previous weeks, as the Central Market, one of the biggest markets in the district was closed for its monthly day off. For example, one of the most commonly used vegetable - tomatoes - were priced at about Rs 50 a kg in the city, with a quarter kg costing even more.Meenakshi, a construction worker said that she had planned to cook tomato rice for her four children as her eldest daughter, who had completed her nursing training was going to Trichy on Monday. ""But the shopkeeper told me that it was Rs 58 a kg, so I bought 500g of chicken instead,"" she said.Ginger, which could be bought for Rs 2 for a tiny piece was sold only by the weighing scale on Sunday for Rs 20 per 100g. Potatoes also went up to Rs 40 per kg and the same amount of carrots and beans cost Rs 80 each. Butterbeans and green peas were sold at Rs 120 a kg in the retail market.Only, ladies fingers, brinjal, cabbage, Bombay onions and drumsticks hovered in the affordable range between Rs 20 to 30. However, shallots (small onions) retailed at Rs 60, while green chillies were sold at Rs 55 per kg. Curry leaves and coriander, which usually come as freebies in the retail vegetable market shot up to Rs 200 a kg, forcing the vendors to stay away from them. ""I stopped buying these two items because customers refuse to pay for them and demand that they be given freely,"" said Mohamed, a vegetable vendor in Anna Nagar.Selvaraj, a wholesale merchant said that the prices are unlikely to dip in the near future unless it rains. ""It has to rain really well, so that the prices come down in about three months. Otherwise, even tomatoes may become rare, as some of them we sold today (Sunday) were thrown away as waste, two months ago,"" he said.Meanwhile, Shankar, a marketing executive said that he found the vegetarian meals in restaurants much cheaper than cooking at home. ""I took my family of four to a restaurant and we had vegetarian lunch at Rs 60 a meal, which worked out cheaper than buying vegetables,"" he said."

Inflation in this category was at 8.73% in March.The easing in food inflation was helped by a sharp drop in prices of vegetables. Inflation in vegetables stood at (-)9.05% in April, against (-)0.95% in the previous month.The inflation in fruits declined to 0.71% during the month as compared to 4.71% in March.

Compared to last month, the prices of all vegetables has doubled in Madikeri, affecting those belonging to middle and lower middle class.A look at the price of some of the main vegetables like beans (Rs 80 - Rs 100), tomato (Rs 40 - Rs 55), beetroot (Rs 40-45), capsicum (Rs 40-45), potato (Rs 24-30), will cause shock wave to the buyers.Cause and effectThe reason for the hike in the vegetable price is said to be lack of vegetable cultivation in Kodagu district.Though the district has fertile soil that suits vegetable cultivation, farmers are showing less interest in vegetable cultivation as they prefer coffee plantation or fruits cultivation.The demand for vegetables is met by importing them from Hassan, Mysore and Bangalore. The green leaves used for cooking are supplied from nearby Piriyapattana. Vegetable vendors fix the price by calculating the transportation charge labourers wage, rate given to the growers and their own profit. This calculation has automatically led to the increased price of vegetables.Lack of supplyThe lack of supply of vegetables to the city market too is another factor adding to the misery. Shortage of water and electricity problem in vegetable growing districts like Belgaum, Tumkur, Kolar, Mysore and Bangalore has led to the less production of vegetables.Though a large number of population is dependent on vegetables for cooking owing to its nutritious and medicinal values, the rise in price has made the people to think twice before purchasing vegetables.Observing the current trend, vegetable vendor Abdul Saleem told Deccan Herald that the vegetables price will be under control as soon as the monsoon begins.

The stock of vegetables inmain markets - Gandhi market andmarket - dwindled sharply on Wednesday, as the trucks engaged in supplying vegetables to Goa fromfailed to enter the state in response to the strike call by the transporters' unions to protest against the entry tax on vehicles imposed by the state government.MapusaVascoPondaBicholimMargao'sSGPDABelgaumSources said only those vehicles transporting goods to the vegetable outlets of the state's horticulture department carried out the business as usual. But, the vegetables went off the shelves within minutes, as even other retailers preferred to buy their requirements from the horticulture stalls. Sources said that even hoteliers purchased their stock of vegetables from the horticulture outlets on Wednesday, forcing the common man to make do without his staple dish of a vegetable from his frugal meal.Consequently, the price of vegetables saw a steep hike in the markets. Rajendra Azgaonkar, a leader of the Gandhi market traders association, confirmed that vegetables were sold at much higher rates in the market. ""Not a single truck carrying vegetables arrived in Margao today,"" he said.In Mapusa market although there is a shortage of most vegetables, the supply of potatoes and onions has not been affected. The scarcity of vegetables is due to the transporters strike.Since potatoes and onions are not highly perishable there was enough stock available in the market till Wednesday. Sources informed that the prices of these two vegetables has also not gone up and remains the same at 20 and 25 respectively. Sources also informed that if the supply is not restored within two days there will be a shortage of these two vegetables also.There was some respite to the consumers as locally grown vegetables like lady fingers, raddish, brinjals were available in the market but in very limited quantity.""Chillies which were available at 30 per kg are now sold for 50 per kg. So far there has been no much impact on restaurants, however if the supply is not resumed soon, the restaurant and tea shops are also likely to be affected,"" said Dhakuli Shirodkar a restaurant owner from Mapusa.Vegetable trucks have not reached the Vasco markets for the last two days. Prashant Naik, a vegetable vendor said, ""The trucks had last come on Monday, but somehow we have managed to keep prices the same.""Though no vegetables came to the market for the last two days, the vendors didn't close down their shops. With very little stock of vegetable and much of it not very fresh, the business was kept running. Another vendor said, ""only the rate of beans have gone up to 120 per kg which are otherwise 60 per kg.""Sulakshni Chalwadi, a vendor said, ""They informed us that the truck will come on Thursday, but if it doesn't come the market will be completely empty. Yet we have not faced the shortage. But as this is a wedding season our business can be affected as we have received orders for supply in advance.""The Ponda vegetable market wore a deserted look on Wednesday as no vegetable truck had entered the market. But, the vegetable supplies were normal at the Goa Bagayatdar Sahakari Kharedi Vikri Society (Bagayatdar society) and horticulture kiosks.Such a situation was noticed in Ponda in February 2011.Shankar Naik, chairman of Budhwarpeth Vyapari Sanghatana (Budhwarpeth traders' association), revealed that the vegetable agents at Belgaum had informed them that they would supply vegetables only if the truckers agreed to travel to Goa.""On Wednesday no truck arrived with vegetables in Ponda market. The vegetable suppliers were ready to supply, but the truckers were not ready to transport them to Goa. This has led to artificial scarcity of vegetables in Ponda market,"" Naik said.Naik also informed that two retailers managed to bring the vegetables from Belgaum personally.Narendra Sawaikar, chairman of Bagayatdar society, said that they had a regular supply and their society would not face any problem even if they would not get stocks for a week. The society supplies all essential commodities at competitive prices through their outlets across the state.""We had our supply as usual and our customers did not face any scarcity of vegetables. Besides this, we will not bend to such tactics and if such a condition arises, we are ready to make alternative arrangements,"" Sawaikar said.Admitting that he had his usual supply of vegetables, William Aguiar, a horticulture kiosk operator at Khadapabandh-Ponda, said that he had to limit the sale to a kg of vegetables per person as he had less stocks and more customers on Wednesday.""I had stocks as per our daily need. But most of the customers had approached me as there was no vegetable shop open in Budhwarpeth (Old Bazaar) in Ponda. So I sold only a kg to each customer,"" Aguiar said.The transporters strike has severely affected the Bicholim market as there was scarcity of vegetables in the market. The scarcity of vegetables in the market has led to the rise in prices of vegetables. Wednesday being the market day at Bicholim, people from rural areas like Ona-Maulingem, Kudchirem, Mulgao, Nanora, Kasarpal, Pilgao, Mayem, Sarvan-karapur and surrounding areas come to Bicholim for purchase of essential commodities. But, due to scarcity of vegetables the villagers from faraway places had to go home empty handed. Only items like potatoes, tomatoes, onions and very few vegetables were available in the market that too in smaller quantities. Green vegetables were not available at all. ""The strike of transporters has severely affected our day-to-day living as we cannot afford to purchase the vegetables at higher rates in these days of inflation,"" said Revati Gaonkar from Kudchirem Bicholim who comes to Bicholim market once in a week to make purchases.One of the vegetable vendors Mehboob Shah said, ""Though the new stock of vegetables is not available, we have not increased the prices of the existing vegetables as we feel that poor people should not become the target of the transporters strike.""One more villager from Bicholim and a teacher by profession Deelip Dhargalkar has requested the state government to come out with an amicable settlement to the problem. He has also requested the transporters to co-operate with the government in this matter.It is also understood that caterers in Bicholim were badly affected as they faced great difficulties to fulfill orders of the people.It is also understood that the wholesale vegetable vendors in Belgaum raised objections to load the vegetables in the trucks which were supposed to transport the same to Goa due to which the vegetables could not reach Goa. It is also understood that some of the retail businessmen managed to bring the vegetables to Bicholim with the help of ST buses."

Also, the demand for vegetables has gone up because of wedding season and other functions in view of auspicious days. The prices will start dropping once the rains arrive, he said. The vegetables have become unaffordable for lower middle class and poor. We do see this trend during summer, but this time they are unusually high in Mangalore, said a home maker.Mango in demandAs temperature soars, demand for fruits such as orange, watermelon and banana has increased.

Similarly, apple (Rs 150 to 200), pomegranate (Rs 100- Rs 120), seedless grape (Rs 60), black grape (Rs 40), watermelon (Rs 16-18), melon (Rs 24), pineapple (Rs 24-30), sapota or Chikku (Rs 35), Jamun (Rs 300- 320).

101,Beyond the reach of conventional wisdom,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130531/jsp/opinion/story_16945632.jsp,2013-05-31,Telegraph,"Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography, Volume One: Not for Turning By Charles Moore, Allen Lane, 30 Few British prime ministers have proved as enduringly fascinating as Margaret Thatcher. Adored by the right, she is equally intriguing to the left who, over the years, have continued to demonize her as the anti-Christ. The extraordinary emotion that she still provokes, twenty three years after she left office, is testament both to the significance of her premiership and the power of her personality. This presents a problem for the historian or biographer who has to separate fact from fiction and search for objectivity in a quagmire of subjective judgments. As Lady Thatchers official biographer, Charles Moore has had unique access to a wealth of previously unseen material. As well as numerous interviews with his subject, her family, friends and colleagues, many of which are illuminating, he has also had access to Lady Thatchers personal papers, including a revelatory correspondence with her previously enigmatic sister, Muriel. The result is a three-dimensional and nuanced portrait of Margaret Thatcher, which is unlikely to be bettered. We hear about her social unease and loneliness at Oxford; her love of clothes, London and dancing. We see kindness to friends and even a rare instance of the young Margaret making fun of herself  particularly surprising as it is about her weight. We also, and for the first time, learn about the boyfriends who preceded Denis as well as her less than star-struck first impression of her future husband: not a very attractive character  very reserved but quite nice. The more dominant features of her character, obvious from a young age, are also fleshed out, often with fresh anecdotes. Her ambition, literal-mindedness, prudence, hard work and, above all, staggering determination leap out of almost every page. The story of Margaret Robertss journey from humble origins in provincial Grantham to Downing Street is well known but it still has the ability to astound. The fact that she was able to propel herself from a small Lincolnshire town (in what Shirley Williams called the potato fields of the country) all the way to Oxford, at a time when very few women went to university, was in itself a considerable achievement and a supreme instance of her ambition and determination. When Margaret informed her headmistress, Miss Gillies, that she wanted to go to Oxford she was told that she couldnt because she didnt have Latin. The seventeen-year-old Margaret replied, Ill get it, and took herself off to the Latin master of the local boys school for lessons. Her ability to overcome supposed brick walls like this was to become the hallmark not only of her life but also her premiership. When she was told repeatedly during the 1970s and early 1980s that the power of the unions could never be broken and that all governments had to seek dtente, she refused to believe it. Nor was the re-taking of the Falkland Islands, as many asserted, a military impossibility  although this did stretch the art of the possible to extremely dangerous limits. What her life up to 1979 taught her was that conventional wisdom, or the norm, did not apply to her. Women from lower-middle class backgrounds didnt usually go to Oxford. They didnt pass their bar exams the same year they gave birth to twins. They didnt challenge (twice) one of the safest Labour seats in the country and (twice) significantly reduce the majority. Finally, and most extraordinarily, they didnt win the leadership of the oldest and most electorally successful democratic political party in the world. Moore charts the rise of Margaret Thatcher with great detail, pointing out nascent examples of early Thatcherite thought: Are YOU, she wrote in a newspaper article during the 1950 general election campaign, going to let this proud island race, who at one time would never accept charity, drift from crisis to crisis...? Or do you believe in sound finance...? He is also extremely good at analysing his subjects mind and thought process: Strictly speaking, Mrs Thatcher was ill equipped for intellectual battle. Despite the brisk efficiency for which she was renowned, she did not have an intellectually orderly mind; nor did she have an original one. Rather than developing ideas of her own, she was a sort of stage-door Johnny for the ideas of others. The central idea, propagated by Keith Joseph and Milton Friedman (amongst others), which Mrs Thatcher seized on once in power was that inflation rather than unemployment was the chief economic dragon which had to be slain  one of the problems with this, of course, is that unemployment is a social as well as an economic problem. She also believed, or was led to believe by economists who were then in vogue, that inflation could be controlled by controlling the money supply. Unfortunately the latter turned out not to be true while the policies pursued in pursuit of the former led to by far the worst recession since the Second World War. Moores belief that the Thatcher governments economic policy was fundamentally right results in the only unhistorical passages in the book. Convinced, like Mrs Thatcher and Geoffrey Howe, that there was no alternative, he is scornful of those within the cabinet who quite legitimately opposed the economic policies which the government was pursuing. He writes of the economic ignorance of the wets (which is simply not true) as compared with the intellectually impressive dries, and he papers over the contradictions of monetarism  such as the fact that inflation doubled during the first year of the Thatcher government despite the punitive measures, creating vast unemployment, which were meant to cut it. As John Campbell has written, by all the normal measures of economic management the Governments [early] performance was dismal but the facts which support this view, along with the costs of recession, are omitted or brushed aside in Moores account. What is not omitted is a fascinating chapter on Mrs Thatchers sometimes difficult relationship with Ronald Reagan (theres nothing there she told Lord Carrington, tapping her head, after a meeting with Reagan) and two excellent chapters on the Falklands. As Moore admits, the Thatcher government and Mrs Thatcher herself were in large part responsible for the Falklands crisis, having failed to make Argentina aware of their determination to protect the islands and, on the contrary, withdrew Britains only naval presence (a fatal casualty of defence cuts) from the South Atlantic. But once the Falklands were invaded, Moore makes it clear that it was only her resilience and courage that allowed the armed forces to bring them back under British control. Although she pragmatically explored the various potential settlement options brought to her by the US Secretary of State, Al Haig, she refused to reward Argentine aggression and tenaciously defended British honour and the rights of the islanders. This is democracy and our island she firmly told President Reagan in a telephone call, I didnt lose some of my finest ships and some of my finest lives to leave quietly under a ceasefire. Moore ends his first volume with British victory in the Falklands. Margaret Thatcher, whose political fortunes were transformed by the war, went on to fight many other battles both at home and diplomatically. She would provoke great opposition and again taste unpopularity. But at the moment when this volume ends she could feel justly proud of having achieved the almost impossible and in destroying what had been the most ubiquitous example of conventional wisdom  British decline. Moore speculates that victory in the Falklands may have been the happiest moment of her life. It was certainly her finest hour."

These chicken traders say they have brisk business till then. Most of their late night buyers are menial labourers who return back to their villages on the outskirts of the city after finishing their work in the city. They buy chicken meat in small that ranges from a few hundred grams to half a kg. As per the shopkeepers their night time business increases when vegetable prices soar high like what has happened now. Most menial labourers prefer to take home small amount of chicken that they cook with potatoes to have a satisfying meal. It costs them less than having a dish made of vegetables. Added to it, as per them, one can have a good meal of rice and chicken curry. But for a meal consisting of curry made of vegetables we may need to have dal which would add up to the expenses, a menial labourer who buys chicken meat most of the nights said. A few decades back chicken was upmarket nonvegetarian delicacy savoured by the moneyed class.

103,Welcome relief: Nine vegetables now for 99,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/Welcome-relief-Nine-vegetables-now-for-99/articleshow/20469503.cms,2013-06-07,The Times Of India,"VISAKHAPATNAM: There is good news for Vizagites burdened by soaring vegetable prices as a couple of rythu bazaars in the city will offer a package of nine vegetables for Rs 99 from today.The package, which will include 1 kg each of onion, potatoes and tomatoes and 250 gm of green chillies, would have cost at least Rs 200 in the open market, where 1 kg of tomatoes costs Rs 60 and 1 kg of onion comes for Rs 25.The packet would also include bottle gourd and leafy vegetables. There would also be half a kg each of three other vegetables from ladies finger, brinjal, carrots, pointed gourds, ivy gourds, beans, ridge gourd depending on their availability at the rythu bazaar.The initiative by the rythu bazaars is to be launched at 8.30 am at MVP Colony.Initially, the Rs 99 vegetable package will be sold at the rythu bazaars at MVP Colony and Seethamadhara and will spread to other areas depending on the success of the initiative.Rythu bazaar assistant director (marketing) B Ravi Kumar said that the pacakage would mandatorily have onion, tomatoes, green chillies and potatoes.The cost of these four mandatory vegetables alone would be nearly Rs 105, and the other vegetables would take the cost of the package past Rs 200 as carrots cost Rs 40 per kg, brinjals are at Rs 40 and ridge gourds are selling at Rs 60 per kg.Kumar said that the initiative had proved to be a major success in Hyderabad, following which the rythu bazaars have decided to introduce the concept in the Port City. The initiative aims to provide succor to people from low-income groups following the steep hike in prices of vegetables witnessed during the last three weeks.MVP rythu bazaar estate officer G Prasad said that the vegetables are being procured at wholesale rates and the benefits of this are being transferred to the people. The number of packages will be increased depending on the response. Initially, they expect to keep around 200 to 250 vegetable packages for sale at the rythu bazaars.Sources said that sale of 200 to 250 packages at rythu bazaars is expected to be completed within 10 minutes in view of the present rates.""It's really good that they have finally started the initiative. However, they should have actually started it some time ago in the summer itself. Now, with rains expected to lash various parts pretty soon, I think the prices will automatically come down,"" said a resident of Seethammadhara, Ramakrishna Rao.A resident of KRM Colony, N V Naidu, said that it should be implemented at regular intervals whenever prices hit the roof. ""The rythu bazaars should also extend this scheme to other areas. Implementing such schemes only in two areas means thousands of others are left out,"" he said. He said that the government should have intervened earlier to provide better relief to the people."

However,there is no impact on household budgets as retail prices surprisingly shot up by about 45%.The current price for 1 kg tomatoes in the wholesale market is about Rs 10,33% lesser than last week. However,in the retail market,the price for 1kg tomatoes was Rs 50 a kilogram,an increase of 43% from last week.We are expecting wholesale prices to be stable for the next fortnight after the drop this week, Deepak D Tekchandani,member of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Board told The Indian Express.In the APMC wholesale market,prices of basic vegetables like onion dipped by 35%. The price of green chilies also went down by 29%. Price of cabbage remained same in the wholesale market over the last week while prices in the retail market rose by 50%.Also,huge differences are observed in the wholesale and retail prices of vegetables.The difference in the wholesale and retail prices of tomatoes was 400% and 380% for green chilies. However it was much lower for potatoes and onions at 67% and 54% respectively. Prices for cauliflower and cabbage also showed a difference of over 300%.Omprakash Tekchandani,a vendor at the Jamalpur APMC Market,explained,Apart from profit margins and transportation costs,the difference in prices is largely due to existence of semi-wholesalers in the system. When the produce goes to the final retailer,it would have already reached a higher price as the semi-wholesaler adds his profit. The final retail prices go up to 300% of the base wholesale price in some cases.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The situation was similar at Seethammadhara Rythu Bazaar, where too the packages were sold in less than an hour.However, some of the people who purchased the packet said that the quality of two or three vegetables was not good. Potatoes were spoilt and green chillies were less than the promised amount, they alleged. ""The onions, tomatoes and carrots were really good. However, the potatoes were damaged and the quantity of green chillies seemed to be much less than it should have been,"" said Venkata Rao of MVP Colony.The gourd distributed was also not of good quality, said K R Srinivas of Maddilapalem. However, he added, ""You can't expect more than that for Rs 99."" Another couple present at the venue didn't seem interested in standing in queue for the Rs 99 vegetable package. If some of the products are being given for less than market price the quality would definitely be sub-standard, they felt.""We will have no choice of selection as all the contents are pre-packed. It is better to purchase from individual traders and be content with the purchase, rather than complain about it later,"" they said.The vegetable packages will continue to be available at the two Rythu Bazaars for the next two weeks, said Rythu Bazaar officials. Depending on the availability of the vegetables, a decision will be taken on extending the scheme to other Rythu Bazaars."

Attributing the price rise to the successive monsoon failure in the state, wholesalers say that the price of most vegetables has gone up by 50 percent. ""This is the first time in recent years prices of all vegetables have skyrocketed,"" said SF Akbar Althaf, president of Kovai Anaithu Mavatta MGR Motha Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.It is not uncommon for the price of few vegetables to incur a steep rise due to factors such as production loss, floods and other natural disasters, he said. What is alarming is the increase in prices of most vegetables. Except for a few country vegetables (naattu kaikari) like okra, gourds and pumpkin, most vegetables are transported to Coimbatore from various locations. A kilogram of tomato priced between Rs.30 and Rs 40 in the wholesale market is sold by retailers for as high as Rs 60. ""In the wholesale market, carrot is priced at Rs 24 per kg and chillies at Rs 29 per kg,"" said Mujibur Rahman, a wholesaler at ASP Vegetables.It may be noted that in the retail market, carrots are priced at Rs 42 per kg, ginger at Rs 170, chillies at Rs 32 and beetroot at Rs 38. Retailers say that the prices of country vegetables have also increased but compared to the so called English vegetables the prices are low. Areas in Coimbatore region known for their tomato and okra produce such as Nachipalayam, Alandurai and Udumalpet have recorded reduced productivity contributing to the price rise. ""Vegetables such as carrots, cabbage, cauliflower and potato are transported to Coimbatore from places like Ooty and Munnar,"" said S J Kathiresan, a retailer.With the onset of southwest monsoon in Kerala, arrival of English vegetables is expected to increase in the next two months. ""This could stabilise the price but there is no immediate reprieve,"" said Akbar Althaf.Apart from households that bear the brunt of the steep price rise, restaurants and mess facilities too are affected. ""Usually, we provide four vegetable dishes with the meal that is priced at Rs.70 but due to skyrocketing prices we have to cut one or two vegetable dishes every other day,"" said a city restaurant owner. According to him, they had just increased the price of a meal a month ago and thus cannot revise the price again. ""If we increase the price again we will lose customers and so we have to adopt such cost-cutting measures,"" he added."

113,Import lobby threatens every petroleum minister: Moily,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Import-lobby-threatens-every-petroleum-minister-Moily/articleshow/20598990.cms,2013-06-15,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Oil minister M Veerappa Moily stepped into a full scale controversy with his claim that every petroleum minister is ""threatened"" by import lobbies being challenged by Opposition leaders as a ""concoction"" who also demanded that the lobbyists be named.The statement, coming in the wake of Moily's efforts to raise the cost of domestic gas, was disputed by at least a couple of former oil ministers who said state firms are largely responsible for imports. ""How can PSUs threaten the minister?"" asked a former oil minister.Others pointed out that private petrochemical companies like Reliance and Essar also import crude oil for their own refineries. It is mystifying as which lobbies Moily is referring to when speaking in the context of his ministry's bid to revise gas prices.The ministry's proposal to revise gas prices was recently referred back to it by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) with the direction that the opinion of the finance ministry and the Planning Commission be sought on some aspects of pricing.Gas pricing has been a hot potato with the government locked in an acrimonious dispute with Reliance industries Ltd (RIL) over the group's demand for a hike in the price of gas from KG fields even as production has fallen.Former oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyer said, ""No threats. Just some hints ... (it) is par for the course (for any oil minister)"" suggesting that he did not quite see ""import lobbies"" in the villainous light that Moily does.Moily's remark, made at an 'open house' for reporters, drew a sharper reaction from CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta who has been attacking the government on gas price revision. He said Moily's statement is ""false"", and claimed gas price revision ""was a gigantic scam in the making"" while demanding the petroleum minister identify the lobbies.BJP's Ram Naik, who is the only oil minister to have completed an uninterrupted five-year term, denied coming across such pressure during his tenure in the NDA government.""A rider who complains about the horse is not a good rider. Moily should be honest and transparent. He should identify the lobbies and persons attached with them. I have never come across anything like this in my tenure. Mr Moily is merely raising a bogey to hide his weakness. He is the fourth oil minister in UPA. All this is happening due to UPA government's lack of a proper petroleum policy,"" Naik told ToI.Moily told the media that ""I am telling you with all sense of responsibility (that) we are floating in oil and gas in this country. And we don't explore it. We put every obstruction not to do it. There are bureaucratic obstructions and delays.""He added, ""And also there are other lobbies. They don't want us to stop imports. There are some lobbies who are working on that. Every minister is threatened many a times. Every minister who occupies this position is threatened.""Moily had stirred a hornets nest in an exclusive interview to ToI on Wednesday, saying import lobbies were opposing efforts to improve investment climate by revising gas pricing policy in tune with market realities, while balancing national priorities. He did not identify or name any person.On Friday, the oil minister raised the pitch further but still declined to identify anyone. He, however, declared he will not be cowed down. ""I am not helpless. Any timid minister will not go forward... I have come here to strive hard for the sake of the country, to work for the country. If anybody thinks that decision making process in the oil sector will be prevented they are totally wrong,"" he added.India's crude import bill stands at $160 billion. This is expected to rise further as the rupee weakens, domestic production declines but demand growth trots along at a healthy pace of 6% or so.""This (increase in oil imports) will work to the detriment of the country. We are challenged by the vagaries of international price... For the last four-five years, investor sentiments are not that high... We have to give right price, otherwise nobody will come. One (deep sea) well may sometime cost in millions of dollars,"" Moily said.Moily said he has proposed to the Cabinet's economic affairs panel that domestic gas prices be raised from $4.2 per unit to $6.7, or about 60%. ""After having dismantled many of the obstacles, it is in the national interest to go for aggressive exploration. Investors should also come. They should be attracted it is not done now,"" Moily said.""We had suggested USD 6.7. It is for CCEA to reduce it or increase. I am not playing for any lobby. I am playing for national lobby. I will ignore lobby. Anybody has useful suggestion, they can give it to me. The history will speak about it. It is for you to judge,"" he added."

""Prices are expected to rise in the short term as there have been crop damages due to the sudden rains,"" said Pradipta Sahoo, head of horticulture at Mother Dairy, a co-operative retailer.Heavy rains in the past 24 hours across the Delhi-NCR region have led to slow arrival of vegetables from nearby villages and also from Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, said Rajinder Sharma, chairman of Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee, the largest wholesale market for vegetables and fruit in Asia. ""Vendors have been quick to cite this as reason to raise prices temporarily.""Traders said it was a temporary phase when farmers were unable to harvest the produce and bring it to mandis. ""Good road infrastructure across the region has, however, ensured daily arrival of 700-800 trucks (each carrying 15-20 tonne) at Azadpur,"" said Sharma. Of this, mangoes accounted for more than a quarter.On Monday, the price of potato at Azadpur mandi ranged between 6.50 a kg and 12 per kg, onion 7.50-14 per kg and tomato 10-15 a kg. ""At the mandis, vegetable prices may increase by 50 paise to 2 a kg, but at the retail level sellers increase prices by up to four times, hurting consumers,"" said Surinder Kohli, a leading vegetable trader from Azadpur. He said only a slight increase of 1-2 a kg has taken place in the prices of vegetables such as ladyfinger ( 16), bitter gourd ( 8) and bottle gourd ( 7).States want Centre to Assess DamageAs per the India Meteorological Department, the Delhi-NCR region has received 91.2 mm rainfall so far, which is 332% above normal for the month of June. In the past 24 hours alone, the region has received 58.50 mm of rains. ""There is no need to worry about the excessive rains. In the next 24 hours, we will see the withdrawal of rains from the north-west region,"" said DP Yadav, the head of National Weather Forecasting Centre at IMD-New Delhi.The combined effect of western disturbances and a low pressure zone across Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh till Chhattisgarh resulted in heavy-to-very heavy rainfall over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, northern Haryana and Chandigarh. Yadav said weather conditions across north India would improve over the next 24 hours."
115,If only farmers knew better,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/If-only-farmers-knew-better/articleshow/20656781.cms,2013-06-19,The Times Of India,"Courtesy rising health concerns among consumers, the spurt in demand for organic food in the state has been meteoric over the last couple of years. But with the farmers not too eager to cope with the change, the supply chain has remained shaky as ever. Low yield and lack of knowledge have apparently kept the farmers away from organic farming, experts say. shirk""Other than the tea estates, there is hardly any organic farm in the eastern region. The concept is yet to take off here. But of late, we have witnessed an increasing demand for organic food at retail stores,"" says Vikas Chadha, chief consultant of Satavic Farms. Chadha's firm trains and provides consultancy in organic farming. ReluctantWith proper monitoring and marketing, organic farming is not only financially viable but a profit-making venture as well. Natureway Agro Products, one of the suppliers to Spencer's, has its own farm where food is grown under strict supervision. ""Growing organic stuff is difficult when it comes to maintaining the conditions laid out by the certification agencies. It takes time initially but things fall in place gradually,"" feels Haimanti Dhir, owner of Natureway.""For example, when we are using cow dung to prepare compost, we have to ensure that the cow was fed with organic food. Otherwise its refuse might contain chemicals,"" she adds. In order to insulate organic farms from being contaminated by harmful chemicals used in the neighbouring farms, long plants are used to screen them off.For a few early birds in Bengal, a foray into organic food has not been a good business proposition. Samadhan Agro, for example, had launched a range of organic food a few years back and had to wind up the operation soon. ""Apart from rice, there wasn't any demand for other products. We couldn't run it then as it was becoming economically unviable,"" said Mrinmay Pramanik, managing director of Samadhan Agro.""Lack of genuine interest among the farmers is one of the reasons why organic farming has not taken off in the eastern region. They found it unviable. Lack of market and awareness, poor networking and support from the government are the other weak points. States like Sikkim that support this form of agriculture has flourished in organic farming. We have large farmer groups working in south India as well,"" Chadha says.Akansha's farm in Falta started growing organic vegetable around two years back and retailing farm produce barely a year ago. ""By now we have around 750 clients who procure directly from us. Vegetable bags reach their doorsteps every morning,"" said Akansha owner RK Bhandari.The entire process of organic farming starts from preparing compost. The process of composting requires making a heap of wetted organic matter (cow dung normally along with other elements like molasses and hyacinth) that is broken down into humus over a period of weeks. Apart from nourishing the plants, compost adds vital humus or humic acid to soil and also acts as a natural pesticide.Bhandari thinks unlike the common myth, prices of organic food can be brought down significantly with economies of scale. ""We sell organic potato and carrot at Rs 22.50 per kg, papaya at Rs 30 per kg and lal sag at Rs 15 per kg. Sweet corn is priced at Rs 80 per kg. The price difference ranges between 20% and 25% at the most,"" he said."

The army is working under testing times to the best of its abilities,"" an army official told IANS.Officials of the highly revered Kedarnath temple say the place where it is located has been devastated, and that there was only death and ruins.B.D. Singh, chief executive officer of the Badrinath-Kedarnath Temple Committee, said the chances of reviving the pilgrimage to these places in the next few years was slim.""What we are seeing is very painful and unbelievable, we don't expect the Char Dham Yatra to resume in the next three years,"" Singh said.More than four days after the cloudburst and incessant rains led to misery, the thousands caught up at various places were faced with lack of potable water, food and power.Many of those who have returned safely told IANS that the stranded do not have enough food and prices of even potato chips and mineral water had shot up in the wake of shortages.""There is an acute shortage of drinking water, medicines and food. One can't imagine what the situation is like,"" said a pilgrim from Basti in Uttar Pradesh who was rescued by a private chopper.To bring back his family of five, he said, he had to cough up Rs.11 lakh on touch down at Dehradun.""People are fleecing others, without showing compassion,"" he complained. The food packets being dropped by choppers were dropping in the rivers, he said.Authorities said 20,000 food packets were dropped by choppers Thursday. Some 500 cars stuck between Guptkashi and Ghansali in Uttarakhand had also been taken out.A temporary helipad has been built in Gaurikund. An aerial survey of Badrinath and Ghangharia was completed Thursday.While the Uttarakhand government did not release any fresh estimate of the dead, Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna admitted that the the death toll would be ""much higher"".Some officials fear thousands may be dead after being washed away in the strong currents of rain swollen rivers or after coming under the debris of collapsed buildings.According to informed sources, the disaster management department has said that 510 big and small roads have been damaged, some completely rippedapart."
117,Medicines that monitor you,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/medicines-that-monitor-you/article4848517.ece,2013-06-20,The Hindu,"They look like normal pills, oblong and a little smaller than a daily vitamin. But if your physician writes a prescription for these pills in the not-too-distant future, you might hear a new twist on an old clich: Take two of these ingestible computers, and they will email me in the morning.As society struggles with the privacy implications of wearable computers like Google Glass, scientists, researchers and some startups are already preparing the next, even more intrusive wave of computing: ingestible computers and minuscule sensors stuffed inside pills.Although these tiny devices are not yet mainstream, some people on the cutting edge are already swallowing them to monitor a range of health data and wirelessly share this information with a doctor. And there are prototypes of tiny, ingestible devices that can do things like automatically open car doors or fill in passwords.For people in extreme professions, like space travel, various versions of these pills have been used for some time. However, in the near future, your family physician  at least if he is technologically savvy  could also have them in his medicinal tool kit.Inside these pills are tiny sensors and transmitters. You swallow them with water, or milk if youd prefer. After that, the devices make their way to the stomach and stay intact as they travel through the intestinal tract.Health vs. deathYou will  voluntarily, I might add  take a pill, which you think of as a pill but is in fact a microscopic robot, which will monitor your systems and wirelessly transmit what is happening, Eric E. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, said last fall at a company conference. If it makes the difference between health and death, youre going to want this thing.One of the pills, made by Proteus Digital Health, a small company in Redwood City, California, does not need a battery. Instead, the body is the power source. Just as a potato can power a light bulb, Proteus has added magnesium and copper on each side of its tiny sensor, which generates just enough electricity from stomach acids.As a Proteus pill hits the bottom of the stomach, it sends information to a cellphone app through a patch worn on the body. The tiny computer can track medication-taking behaviours  did Grandma take her pills today, and what time?  and monitor how a patients body is responding to medicine. It also detects the persons movements and rest patterns.Executives at the company, which recently raised $62.5 million from investors, say they believe that these pills will help patients with physical and neurological problems. People with heart failure-related difficulties could monitor blood flow and body temperature; those with central nervous system issues, including schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease, could take the pills to monitor vital signs in real time. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Proteus pill last year.A pill called the CorTemp Ingestible Core Body Temperature Sensor, made by HQ Inc. in Palmetto, Florida, has a built-in battery and wirelessly transmits real-time body temperature as it travels through a person.Firefighters, football players, soldiers and astronauts have used the device so their employers can monitor them and ensure they do not overheat in high temperatures. CorTemp began in 2006 as a research collaboration from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Lee Carbonelli, HQs marketing director, said the company hoped, in the next year, to have a consumer version that would wirelessly communicate to a smartphone app.Future generations of these pills could even be convenience tools.Last month, Regina Dugan, senior vice president for Motorola Mobilitys advanced technology and projects group, showed off an example, along with wearable radio frequency identification tattoos that attach to the skin like a sticker, at the D: All Things Digital technology conference.Once that pill is in your body, you could pick up your smartphone and not have to type in a password. Instead, you are the password. Sit in the car and it will start. Touch the handle to your home door and it will automatically unlock. Essentially, your entire body becomes your authentication token, Ms. Dugan said.Privacy implicationsBut if people are worried about the privacy implications of wearable computing devices, just wait until they try to wrap their heads around ingestible computing.This is yet another one of these technologies where there are wonderful options and terrible options, simultaneously, said John Perry Barlow, a founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocacy group. The wonderful is that there are a great number of things you want to know about yourself on a continual basis, especially if youre diabetic or suffer from another disease. The terrible is that health insurance companies could know about the inner workings of your body.And the implications of a tiny computer inside your body being hacked? Lets say they are troubling.There is, of course, one last question for this little pill. After it has done its job, flowing down around the stomach and through the intestinal tract, what happens next?It passes naturally thought the body in about 24 hours, Mr. Carbonelli said, but since each pill costs $46, some people choose to recover and recycle it.

These outlets are located in the city and the suburbs and will sell 31 varieties of vegetable starting from Rs. 1.50 for a piece of lemon to Rs.140 for a kg of ginger.Vegetables such as tomato, onion, potato and beans have become very costly, following a fall in production and arrivals from neighbouring States.An official release said vegetables would be purchased directly from farmers and cooperative society purchase centres and brought to Chennai. As farmers are paid for the procured vegetables on a daily basis through the respective cooperative societies, the system eliminates middlemen.The vegetables procured from various markets will be preserved in a cold storage facility at Kamadhenu Cooperative Supermarket at Teynampet here before being sent to consumer outlets.We have been buying ginger in smaller quantities as it is priced at Rs.175 a kg in the open market. We stopped buying costly vegetables, fearing that it may eat into our monthly budget. But, today, I was able to buy a sizeable quantity of vegetables for Rs.100 at this outlet, said K. Kamala of Triplicane.While households have been postponing their purchases, caterers are left with little choice as cutting down on vegetables would affect their business severely. We have to buy all types of vegetables, irrespective of the daily market price or we may lose our customers, said the manager of a fast food outlet in Vadapalani.The spiralling prices have affected the vegetable vendors margin. Nowadays, people are buying less to offset the impact of prices. We hope the prices will come down soon after arrivals go up, said a vendor at the Koyambedu market."

SrinathResidents cutting across the social and economic spectrum flocked to the farm-fresh consumer outlets in the citys suburbs on Thursday, soon after their inauguration earlier in the day.Chief Minister Jayalalithaa launched 31 Pannai Pasumai Nugarvor Kootturavu Kadai through video-conferencing from the Secretariat. Four of the outlets, which will sell 31 varieties of vegetables, are in the citys immediate southern suburbs  Madipakkam, Rajakilpakkam, East Tambaram and Pozhichalur  and one is in Porur in the west.The huge difference in the prices of locally-available vegetables at the new outlets compared to those in other markets was evident. The prices of onion, tomato and potato are far lower than those quoted in supermarkets run by giant firms, and lower than even those in an Uzhavar Sandhai and other important markets such as Tambaram.On Thursday, the prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes per kg at an airconditioned supermarket in Tambaram was Rs. 29, Rs. 49 and Rs. 41 respectively, while the rates for the same vegetables at the consumer outlets were Rs. 20, Rs. 30 and Rs. 20 respectively.A bunch of coriander that costs between Rs. 8 and Rs. 12 elsewhere is available here for just Rs. 6. The biggest bargains are beans and carrots as their prices are lesser by more than 50 per cent compared to the rates at markets and air-conditioned stores, said K. Sarojini, a homemaker of Rajakilpakkam.R. Venkatraman, a pensioner, welcomed the launch of the new outlets, stating it was long overdue. He said the agriculture department was earlier running a similar store attached to the fair price shop of the Kancheepuram district consumer cooperative welfare society, but it had been shut down.Middlemen and leading chains seem to be a law unto themselves. They lure customers through offers and once the bond is established, they resort to unjust pricing, said M.B. Sundaram, another pensioner.Residents, while welcoming the electronic billing method, said the government should ensure retailers do not buy vegetables in bulk from the outlets and resell them. Officials said they had instructed staff at the outlets to be wary of merchants and not sell vegetables in bulk.They said the department of cooperation, food and consumer protection procured the vegetables directly from farmers in places such as Oddanchathiram and Dharmapuri and brought them to the outlets. Despite the transportation costs involved, they were able to maintain prices lower than those anywhere else due to the elimination of middlemen.At the end of the day, visitors to the outlets had to go back empty-handed as all the vegetables were sold out. The outlets had sold 13,000 kg of different varieties of vegetables for Rs. 3 lakh, a margin of Rs. 25,000 over the procurement price. Buyers on Thursday got a small piece of ginger (the costliest item in the outlets) free of cost.Following the huge response, officials have now decided to operate the outlets from 7.30 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.Four of the outlets are in the citys immediate southern suburbs and one is in Porur in the west"
121,Restaurant review: Sigree Global Grill (Multi-cuisine buffets),http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tastingtimes/restaurant-review-sigree-global-grill-multi-cuisine-buffets/,2013-06-21,The Times Of India,"If this accompanying photo had a sound track, youd hear Angelo Colasso belting out What a wonderful world. If it had a video attached to it, youd see the grill courses of the multi-cuisine buffet sizzling on the table (what you see in the photograph are only the starters). And all this in Powai (which I love), to music (which I also love) and that too a buffet experience (which I normally dislike immensely), but this one was a super surprise.DCORI zoomed up to the first floor and into a large, handsome, brightly lit restaurant Sigree Global Grill. It was packed and steadily getting more so. An open kitchen, a long buffet area, a bar and a delightful buzz. Bright tiles and space for a grill (fired by charcoal) on each table too. And then, of course, there was music filling the air.FOODOnly buffets for lunch and dinner, each with a staggering choice. The starters are served on the table, beginning with the choice of breads and dips and starters (okayish) and then wow! Taking off garmagaram with grills, plump prawns, bbq chicken, and Teriyaki chicken wings. Even the veggie options of the softest of paneer and cilantro mustard broccoli delighted. There was consistently good food, from the Mediterranean fish to the Harissa grilled chicken and the flavoursome murg dhaniya salan with biryani. The potato crusted shepherd pie, fragrant Thai curry, were happy surprises. Live pasta counter too. Check out the special pricing offers on alcohol and beverages.MINUS POINTSMy expectations for the Chinese courses were very high, since Sigree Global Grill is the new offering of Anjan Chatterjees Mainland China (Andheri and Sakinaka branches are my favourites) group. Unfortunately, the lemongrass seafood dumpling and the veg basil dim sum were not on par with the Mainland China ones, though the chicken suimai made up for it. While the taste of the unique blackbean topping on the pizza was good, its crust was too thick. Doughy quesadilla, gloopy risotto, overcooked pindi channa and stringy roast chicken, desserts disappointed, except for the ice creams with the medley of dessert sauces, the rest were gelatinous. Though the nolen gur with sego was a refreshing surprise. No beef or pork served here.MY POINTAs a rule, I hate buffets, but heres a brand new buffet restaurant that is the exception that proves the rule. It not only uses quality ingredients but also cooks up many afresh (superb grills) and it has plenty for veggies. Its mouthful of a name Sigree Global Grill does not even begin to cover the staggering variety of grills, bakes, steamed, pan-fried, deep fried and more. The price per head per meal inclusive of taxes, lunch (Monday to Thursday Rs 550, Friday to Sun Rs 725) and dinner (Mon to Thursday Rs 745, Friday to Sunday Rs 845.) No wonder it was packed when I swooped in for an early weekday dinner.

Luckily,the alcohol in Bar.King Street is cheap and the air conditioning effective,otherwise this review wouldnt have passed muster with the morality of anthropomorphic animals.Up a stairwell decorated with wallpapered tired old street signs,from Downing to Canal Road is the restaurant. A dimly lit space with a long bar and even more wallpaperdepicting streets from around the world. By now it is evident to even the most obtuse observers that street food from around the world is the restaurant barscentral motif.The wait staff is skeletal,comprising,for the duration of our afternoon visit,one server and one assistant manager,judging from her lack of uniform. The reasons for this could either be because the restaurants terrace floor is under renovation or because the staff is just so efficient. After having waited 17 minutes (yes,we timed them) to be noticed and then being offered the menu (after remarking well probably be served tomorrow in strident tones),we decide its definitely not the latter reason.The alcohol is extremely inexpensive,with a pint of Carlsberg setting you back 97 bucks,a pittance when compared to the prices of other dining establishments. Other alcohol is similarly priced. Think Mybar with better ambience,but distressingly similar music (comprising Pitbull and his other pop cohorts,played at a volume that would deafen the average infant).Perhaps its culinary cowardice,but about 90 per cent of the non-vegetarian menu is chicken. The vegetarian options are similarly fowl,with paneer and potato (the other chicken as it were) ruling the roost. Resigned to our fates,we order the Tequila Chicken Tikka (how can one not) and Chicken Adobo with sweet Soya (er,they mean soy surely?). For our mains,we luckily espy a Mutton Seekh Wrap in a section marked Wrapped Up.The tikka clearly believes greatly in the power of suggestion,as we cannot discern even a trace of tequila,or any other alcohol,making it a low-spirited dish to say the least. Perhaps the chefs forgot that alcohol dissipates when exposed to hot things like,say,fire. The Adobo,on the other hand,delivers what it promises,with enough soy(a) to stock a Chinese kitchen for a month. And then theres the wrap,with an astounding lack of wrap,merely comprising seekhs kebabs.

Chidambaram had stated that CTT  on the lines of the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) in the capital market  would be levied on non-farm items to be paid by the seller only in futures trading.At 0.01 per cent of the transaction value, the levy would work out to Rs.10 on a deal worth Rs.1 lakh.The implementation of CTT, however, got delayed owing to detailed consultations between the Ministry and various stakeholders on the list of non-farm commodities to be brought under the levy.National levelOut of the 22 commodity bourses in the country, only six of them operate at the national level. In 2012-13, the combined turnover of these exchanges stood at Rs.170,46,840 crore, six per cent lower as compared to the previous fiscal. Also, of the total turnover, while over 80 per cent comes from non-agricultural commodities, the turnover from futures trade accounts for about 15 per cent of the total trade in commodity segment.Processed farm items such as sugarwill also come under CTTImplementation of CTT was delayeddue to detailed consultation"

These outlets are located in the city and the suburbs and will sell 31 varieties of vegetable starting from Rs. 1.50 for a piece of lemon to Rs.140 for a kg of ginger.Vegetables such as tomato, onion, potato and beans have become very costly, following a fall in production and arrivals from neighbouring States.An official release said vegetables would be purchased directly from farmers and cooperative society purchase centres and brought to Chennai. As farmers are paid for the procured vegetables on a daily basis through the respective cooperative societies, the system eliminates middlemen.The vegetables procured from various markets will be preserved in a cold storage facility at Kamadhenu Cooperative Supermarket at Teynampet here before being sent to consumer outlets.We have been buying ginger in smaller quantities as it is priced at Rs.175 a kg in the open market. We stopped buying costly vegetables, fearing that it may eat into our monthly budget. But, today, I was able to buy a sizeable quantity of vegetables for Rs.100 at this outlet, said K. Kamala of Triplicane.While households have been postponing their purchases, caterers are left with little choice as cutting down on vegetables would affect their business severely. We have to buy all types of vegetables, irrespective of the daily market price or we may lose our customers, said the manager of a fast food outlet in Vadapalani.The spiralling prices have affected the vegetable vendors margin. Nowadays, people are buying less to offset the impact of prices. We hope the prices will come down soon after arrivals go up, said a vendor at the Koyambedu market here."

126,Costly veggies give denizens sleepless nights,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/Costly-veggies-give-denizens-sleepless-nights/articleshow/20756558.cms,2013-06-25,The Times Of India,"ALLAHABAD: The soaring price of vegetables is giving sleepless nights to denizens. In stark contrast to the past, vegetables, including potato and onion, are becoming dearer during monsoon this year.Pulses like arhar and moong are already skyrocketing along with other items like sugar, oil etc. The rise in vegetable price has come as a double-shocker for the denizens. Tomatoes are selling at Rs 60 per kilo, with ladyfinger at Rs 50/kg and brinjal at Rs 40/kg. Apart from these vegetables, capsicum is being sold at Rs 80 per kg, bitter gourd at Rs 80 and gourd bottle at Rs 20 per piece. Though cauliflower and cabbage too are available in the market, vendors are extracting anything between Rs 55 and Rs 60 for a small piece.Denizens, who love to enjoy their morning tea laced with ginger are feeling the pinch as it is being sold at Rs 200 per kg or Rs 25 per 100 grams. Vegetable suppliers blame short supply and rising fuel price for the dearer vegetables.A wholesale trader at Mundra Mandi denied the assumption that hoarding of vegetables have to a spurt in prices. ""These are daily consumable and perishable items. So no question of stocking,"" he said. However, he said that torrential rains in the recent past could have damaged the vegetable produce and its impact would be evident in the market in coming days. ""Heavy rains in upper Himalayas and the destruction of roads have blocked arrival of some vegetables and fruits from that region. Even a few fruits may turn dearer in days to come,"" said Sanjeev Kerserwani, a vegetable vendor of Preetam Nagar.However, it's the housewives whose kitchen budget has taken a worst hit owing to skyrocketing prices. Nalini of Rajroorpur said ""The high prices of vegetables have ruined our budget. We are praying that rates come down in days to come."" Stating that she was trying to take the rising cost in her stride she said that it would be difficult if the prices continue to riseResidents lamented that prices of all essential commodities had gone up. ''Authorities should initiate some measures to check the rise of prices of vegetables,"" locals said."
127,Combating bio-terrorism,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/341058/combating-bio-terrorism.html,2013-06-26,Deccan Herald,"Combating bio-terrorismDevinder Sharma, June 25, 2013: 9:48 ISTNew harmful pesticides: Realising the destruction wrought by invasive species, the world has woken up to the threat arising from imported weeds.Several years ago, at the time when India was importing wheat from America under PL-480, some unknown weeds had crept in with import consignments. Two weeds particularly  congress grass or gajarghas and phulnuor lantana camera  have now become a menace.Congress grass is widespread and is estimated to occupy an area equivalent to the total area of Nepal. On the other hand, phulnuis considered to be the worlds most troublesome weed, found in 60 countries.Both these deadly weeds are very difficult to be controlled. Phulnusis has already spread to 13.2 million hectare of pasture land in India and several studies have estimated the cost to eradicate this weed at more than Rs 500 per hectare. Congress grass grows widely in the farms, national parks and on roadside. It is also rated as a serious invasive weed spreading as far as Australia and in almost all African countries.The United States of America has a law against bio-terrorism. It is basically to ensure that no unwanted alien invasive species -- later assuming menacing proportions -- enters America. Such is the hysteria surrounding the alien species that the US uses all kinds of non-tariff barriers to stop the entry of agricultural commodities that are likely to come with hitherto unknown pests and diseases.This precaution is fine. But it turns a blind eye to a bigger threat that is engulfing its agriculture  the spread of superweeds. Ask any farmer and he will tell you how damaging the imported weeds have been. Realising the destruction wrought by invasive species, over the years the world has woken up to the threat arising from imported weeds. Several international treaties and laws have been put in place to check the spread of weeds from one country to another.Both India as well as America have enacted laws that restrict the entry of weeds from any country, terming it as `bio-terrorism.In addition to the damage (and the additional costs) incurred by farmers to fight the imported weeds, what should be more worrying for Indian farmers is the creation of new superweeds  weeds that cannot be easily controlled with chemical pesticides  that are now becoming a nuisance in America, Canada and 26 other countries where genetically-modified (GM) crops are being cultivated.These weeds are not imported with grain or seed consignments, but develop when GM crops which are resistant to roundup weedicide are cultivated. Ever since GM crops have been commercialised, the pace at which insects and weeds are not only developing resistance but eventually turning out to be monsters has only hastened.Alarming appearanceTake the case of America. Ten years ago, agribusiness company Monsanto had denied any resistance developing in crop plants to its roundup weedicides. But today, nearly half of Americas croplands are infected with these superweeds. It has turned croplands especially where GM maize and Soya are cultivated  into weed battlefields. In just three years, between 2010 and 2012, the area under the superweeds has almost doubled from 32.6 million acres to 61.2 million acres.These plants have alarmingly appeared in the provinces of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri. In neighbouring Canada, more than one million acres of Canadian farmland have roundup-resistant weeds growing on them, including 43,000 acre in Manitoba alone.Farmers are unable to control these superweeds even if they rise the amount of roundup weedicide to 10 times the usual dose. Monsanto is now asking farmers to prepare cocktails of pesticides with potent and banned chemicals like 2,4-D, which at one time was also used in India. With the push for GM crops that is all visible, India too would be faced with the menace of superweeds in the years to come.From poisoned soils and excessively mined undergroundwater, modern agriculture is fast moving to create an ecologically disastrous landscape where superweeds will dominate. Not only superweeds, sooner than expected, you will find that combating the newly evolving dreaded superpestsweeds, insects and micro-organismswill become a major industry. Farmers will be increasingly battling the new army of harmful pests thereby pushing them deeper and deeper into a worsening agrarian crisis.Ever since insect resistance was first reported in 1914, studies have shown that more than 500 species of insects, moths and spiders have developed resistance to a pesticide. Some pests have developed multiple resistances to a series of pesticides. Colarado potato beetle for instance is known to be resistant to 52 different compounds belonging to all major pesticides classes, says a paper published in the American Journal of Potato Research. Even certain species of rats in UK have become resistant to rat poisons consuming about five times the lethal dose and yet surviving.India has already reported pink boll worm insects developing resistance to Bt cotton. For the industry, the development of superbugs and superweeds across the globe provides an immense business opportunity. GM companies are asking farmers to spray more stronger and potent chemicals, often a cocktail of heady pesticides. Its a double whammy for the agribusiness companies. Raking in money from the sale of GM seeds, and then all the chemicals needed to control superpests!"

The steepest hike has been in the prices of tomatoes,okra,peas and capsicum  which have all shot up by 60 per cent.The price of the tomato,in June last year,was about Rs 25 per-kg where as,now the vegetable is being sold for Rs 40-50 per-kg. Similarly,the prices of the peas were 10-15 per kg last year while it now costs 15-30 per kg. Prices of the vegetables including capsicum,cucumber and arbi have increased by around 25 per cent as compared to last year.Vendors are blaming it on poor supply,particularly from Himachal Pradesh. A wholesaler in the Grain market,Sector-26,said: Very few trucks are coming from Himachal Pradesh and that is the reason behind the high price of vegetable.It is a normal demand and supply trend. The prices are high in the market as the stocks are less,as soon as the stocks will be in,prices will be back to its own pace, added another vegetable vendor at the grain market.Potato and onion prices have also surged to Rs 15-20 and Rs 25 per-kg respectively as compared to last year when onions cost Rs10-12 per-kg while potatoes were Rs 15-18 per-kg.GR Pillai,secretary,Grain Market,Sector-26,said: Vegetable market is a market of fluctuations. Short supply of some of the vegetables like tomatoes and capsicum is taking their prices up. Changing temperature are also affecting the production of some vegetables. The incessant rains possibly have disrupted the supply of the vegetables especially tomatoes from Himachal Pradesh. HP is opening up more sabzi-mandis in their state due to which the arrival of the tomatoes to the city is very less,therefore the prices are high.Amarpreet Singh,Supervisor of Apni Mandi,said,Our mandi has the maximum rates of all the vegetables. It is mainly because of the heavy rains,the prices of the commonly used vegetables have increased. The prices of the tomatoes are so high that nobody in our mandi could afford to bring the tomatoes today.

Besides ensuring fair prices to farmers for their produce, HOPCOMS supplies quality fruits and vegetables to customers.Hence, strengthening the society would benefit both farmers and customers, he said.To expand marketing networks, the government should allocate land to HOPCOMS in public gardens to set up fruit and vegetable stalls. The government should issue orders to the urban development authorities in this regard.Besides, the government should allow HOPCOMS to set up stalls at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee yards in small towns and taluk headquarters, he said.The government should provide a support price of Rs. 5 per kg for tomatoes, green chilli, potato and onion for HOPCOMS to buy from farmers. Out of this, the federation would pass on Rs. 2 per kg to producers, Rs. 2 per kg to customers as concession and retain Re. 1 as processing fee.Other demands of the federation include providing 50 per cent subsidy on inter-State and inter-district transportation costs, and setting up cold storage facilities, grading centres and processing units in all districts.The government should form guidelines on streamlining the sale of fruit and vegetables to other States, Mr. Hosmani said."

Located in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, on the banks of the river Mississippi, it is one of the largest public universities in the U.S.The university, renowned for its research in engineering sciences, has a rich lingual, cultural and racial diversity. I landed in Minneapolis in August 2011; the initial few weeks were filled with excitement of new environement, new people, setting up my own apartment and so on.The biggest challenge I faced was understanding the accent of professors from different nationalities. For all those aspiring to do masters abroad, please learn to cook: salty burnt potatoes are not as tasty as you would want them to be.The classroom ambience was alien to me. Learning was more by interaction with the professors. Within a few weeks, assignments, paper presentations and projects were showered on us.Over there, it was the approach to answers that students give that was important. The students have access to state-of-the-art labs and high-precision software, the ones normally available only to the industry.Campus lifeIn the short time that was available after academic work, we enjoyed walking through the vast expanses of the well-maintained campus. The university buildings built in the 19th Century stood parallel to the modern artistic architectural establishments, beautifying the campus in a surreal way.Minneapolis happens to be home to the largest mall in the United States  Mall of America  a major attraction for the locals. The biggest concern that most of us have when we plan our masters abroad is the cost factor.I took up various campus jobs to earn that extra buck. I worked as a barista in a caf and as a research assistant in a business school. Universities here do not have the concept of campus placement.Job fairs are arranged and students get to interact with the representatives from the industry. Studying abroad has made me bold, observant and more interactive with people from various walks of life. I learnt the science of society more than electrical engineering. All these landed me an internship in Intel Corporation, where I got absorbed as a full-time employee. I will be joining them once I graduate.The writer is pursuing her Masters in Electrical engineering at University of Minnesota, Minneapolis."

134,Restaurant review: House of Asia(Multi-cuisine),http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tastingtimes/restaurant-review-house-of-asia-multi-cuisine/,2013-07-04,The Times Of India,"Stop press. Its started raining Asian and Japanese restaurants in Mumbai. There wasnt a single such restaurant twenty five years ago, when I started writing about food. In fact, Teppanyaki was unheard of, as was sushi. Till now, South Mumbai and the Western suburbs were buzzing with these, now its the turn of the Eastern suburbs too. Or so I discover on a rained out day in Andheri (E). Here, the traffic is snarled and everything is growing (buildings and potholes too) but I am regaled by a happy surprise and its called (no prizes for guessing) House of Asia.DCORTucked into the belly of the smart and compact four-star Mirador hotel, House of Asia is a marbled space, interspersed with latticed woodwork. Live interactive counters and buffet stations are tucked into the far end of the eatery. Its functional and pleasant.FOODHappily, HOA produces an unusually appealing roster of Thai, Chinese, Malay and Indian dishes, both in its  la carte and buffet menu. Buffet buffs zone in here and youll be happy you did. The Princeton-educated Rahul Mehra (from the family who own the hotel) ensures that HOAs strength lies in the live counters, be it Teppanyaki (the short, grained Teppan rice with its nutty bite, chicken Teppan) and the freshly-made, rich and dripping with ghee ulte tawe ka paratha.The Chinese dishes of chicken kung pao, sauted vegetables lose their freshness by sitting too long in the chafing dishes but nonetheless manage to salvage some flavour. As does the spiced pumpkin Indonesian curry and the Vietnamese stuffed mushrooms, malai paneer and noodles. Well-made Thai dishes too. Plenty of choice of salads and desserts, both tasty and above average. Be it the almond cake, the German cold pudding. And even the kheer kadam. Home-made vanilla gelato and strawberry gelato delight.Should you go for the  la carte, then stay with the Indian options, delightful rajma galoti kabab, beetroot marinated tangri kabab is tasty as is the Andhra gongura murg. Its the grilled banana with coconut sauce which becomes more engrossing with each bite.MINUS POINTSThe sushi and dim sum represent one of the menus weaker spans. Thick potato starch skins clasp the dim sum, the sushi is lacklustre and stale. The chicken kababs are dry and some of the Indian gravy dishes slushy with masala.MY POINTHOA manages to hit the sweet spot and find the balance between Asian and Indian dishes on its large buffet menu. Veggies have a great choice. A great combination of freshly cooked dishes on the buffet and price points (buffet lunch is Rs 450, dinner for Rs 550 and  la carte Rs 600 per head) make HOA a winner. Avoidable dim sum and sushi, but very good value multi-cuisine buffets (with Teppanyaki and other live stations) have magnetised not just the corporate lunchers but also families looking for variety and choice.

135,"Veggies costlier, reason unclear",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Veggies-costlier-reason-unclear/articleshow/20904624.cms,2013-07-04,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: After two weeks, the floods have hit home. Vegetable prices, which were expected to rise due to crop and road damage, have soared in the past few days. Tomatoes are90/kg in north Delhi; capsicum is at Rs 110/kg in east Delhi. Even potatoes are retailing above Rs 20/kg across the city. While hawkers blame the bad weather, in the wholesale hub of Azadpur Mandi, agents say, prices haven't changed at all. Are the prices up because of profiteering by retailers?RsTOI visited many localities on Wednesday and found vegetable prices have increased 2-4 times. And the rates differ between colonies depending on residents' paying capacity. At times, the price difference goes up to Rs 50 for the same vegetable.In their defence, hawkers say the rains have not only affected the availability of vegetables but also their quality: a lot of produce is not fit to sell. Ram Singh, who sells only tomatoes at his shop in Indra Market, is charging Rs 80/kg. ""We used to buy tomatoes from Punjab and the Karnal region but now the produce arrives only from Shimla and Nainital,"" he said, referring to the high cost of transportation. Capsicum has become a luxury, especially in east Delhi (supplied from Ghazipur Mandi). In west Delhi, where stocks arrive from the Azadpur Mandi, it is cheaper.The high prices have also changed the buying pattern. ""People have stopped buying in large quantities. They only buy around 250-500 grams of everything,"" said Suresh, a vegetable vendor in Sarojini Nagar. ""I avoid vegetable shops in and around upscale colonies as they always charge more than the market rate,"" said Anand Prakash, resident of Palam Vihar.Organized retailers such as Reliance and Safal, though, continue to sell at near-wholesale rates, with tomatoes at Rs 45-50/kg. But many people still prefer to buy from hawkers. ""The big stores neither bargain nor give regular customers a better deal,"" said Smita Khurana, resident of Rajouri Garden. Tomatoes are at Rs 90/kg in Model Town, north Delhi that has a large student population. ""The main market is quite far, so we have to make do with the local vendors for our everyday supplies,"" said Neel Jha, resident of Hudson Lane.The wholesalers in Azadpur Mandi have a different take on the situation. ""Retailers are earning much more than what they should. Our supplies come mainly from the neighbouring regions of Haryana and Punjab, and these have not been affected much by the Uttarakhand floods. Road transport has become a hassle, but this is just an excuse to drive up rates,"" said Surender Kohli, president of the mandi's Vegetable and Fruits Trading Association."
136,Tomato prices in city see sharp rise as supply drops,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/tomato-prices-in-city-see-sharp-rise-as-supply-drops/,2013-07-05,Indian Express,"The rates of one very important vegetable,the tomato,have risen considerably,from Rs 25-40 to Rs 40-60 per kg,due to a supply crunch.GR Pillai,secretary of the grain market at Sector 26,said,Tomatoes are mostly produced in Himachal Pradesh during the monsoon in the north and are transported from there throughout the region,but the quantity we are receiving is very less. Himachal Pradesh is opening up more subzi-mandis in their state,due to which the arrival of the tomatoes to the city is very less,therefore the prices are very high.Two or three months ago,tomatoes were even being supplied from Maharashtra but from there also,we are getting none. In the morning,the rates in the mandi were comparatively high because people were coming from Punjab and Haryana,the prices of the tomatoes were Rs 40-45 per kg but in the evening,the prices surprisingly came down to Rs 25-40 per kg, added Pillai.The prices of the tomatoes,last year,in the same month were about Rs 25 per kg but now the tomatoes are being sold at Rs 40-60 per kg in the grain market.According to Kuldeep Singh,secretary of Apni Mandi,It is because of the incessant rains that the crops has been spoiled due to which there is no harvest at all. The fluctuations in the market depends on the demand and supply. Singh adds,The tomatoes are very few in our mandi today because the heavy monsoon showers in Himachal Pradesh has led to poor produce of tomatoes. We have two varieties of tomatoes in the mandi,one is him sona worth Rs 60 per kg and desi costing Rs 50 per kg.Other vegetables also have seen a price hike in the last few days including potatoes,capsicum,lady finger etc. Potato and onion prices have also surged up to Rs 15-20 and Rs 25 per kg respectively as compared to last year when the prices of onions were Rs 10-12 per kg while those of potatoes were Rs 15-18 per kg.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

""The recent spells of rain have flooded the diara (riverine) areas, where most of the vegetables are grown. This has affected vegetable supplies,"" said a wholesaler, Gopinath Sahu. ""Till the next crop is ready for harvest, vegetables' scarcity and the resultant higher prices will continue,"" he said.Vegetable merchants said the rain has also damaged the crop in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh, which supply around 40% of vegetables to the state.Tomato, the common man's vegetable, is being sold at Rs 70 to Rs 80 a kg, depending on the locality. French beans and capsicums have crossed Rs 100 per kilogram mark in the retail market and other common vegetables have also followed suit.""This is not for the first time that vegetables prices have skyrocketed. In fact, the hike has been quite sustained and every week there has been a considerable jump,"" said a retail vegetable seller, Fayaz Akbar.It is not uncommon for the prices of vegetables to register a steep rise due to factors such as rain, he said. What is alarming is the extent of increase n prices of almost all the vegetables. ""In the wholesale market, carrot is priced at Rs 55 per kg and chillies at Rs 30 per kg,"" said Rahman, a wholesaler at Mithapur mandi.It may be mentioned here that in the retail market, carrots are priced at Rs 60 per kg, ginger at Rs 170, chillies at Rs 32 and beetroot at Rs 38. Retailers say the price of pointed gourd has increased to Rs 22-25 a kg from Rs 16, bitter gourd at Rs 20 a kg, okra or ladies finger at Rs 24 a kg, while bottle gourd and sponge gourds are sold at Rs 20 and Rs 22 a kg.Even onion prices have soared to Rs 25-30 a kg and potato to Rs 16-17 a kg. Apart from households that bear the brunt of the steep price rise, restaurants and mess facilities too are affected. ""Usually, we provide four vegetable dishes with the meal that is priced at Rs 170, but due to skyrocketing prices we had to cut one or two vegetable dishes every other day,"" said a city restaurant owner. According to him, they had just increased the price of a meal a month ago and thus cannot revise the price again. ""If we increase the price again, we will lose customers and so we have to adopt cost-cutting measures,"" he added."

According to the, the situation will persist fora month posing an extra burden on people, especially during the holy month ofand.KANPURcucerbitsstockistsatleastRamzanShravanMost meat lovers will be turning veggies for the month of Ramzan, as having non-veg in high humidity could take the health to a toll. While, those who will be observing fasts in the auspicious month of Shravan will have to bear an extra burden of hikes prices of vegetables and fruits.The hike in fuel prices has been already pushing the retail value of vegetables and fruits high for an average middle class man. And now with the latest hike in prices due to rains and short supply, providing a proper diet to the family might become an impossible task for many.""Prices always get pushed up during the rainy season,"" said a vegetable vendor, Ashok Sahu.""Vegetables rot faster in humid weather due to which less quantity arrives in the markets hence escalating the prices,"" he added. The scorching summers had reduced the produce in the farms. The rains, which flooded the fields in past days, caused further damage to the crops.Even a cheap vegetable like pumpkin is being sold for Rs 25 per KG due to short supply. If the rains continued in a similar way, the prices might go up further.Manu Singh, a wholesale vegetable dealer in Chakarpur Mandi, said prices of various vegetables are expected to rise by Rs 5-10 per kg due to fast approaching Ramzan and Shravan month. The prices are already high and are expected to go beyond.The retail price of basic vegetables like potato and onion at present is Rs 15-20 and Rs 20-25 per kg, respectively which is around 40% extra from the rates in last fortnight.The biggest hit is the tomato which was sold at Rs 100 per kg on Saturday. The green vegetables are also being sold at the cost of Rs 40 to 60 per kg.Consumers, who cannot go to the wholesale markets are dependent on retailers in their localities and are forced to pay even higher prices.For Shalini Srivastava, it was already tough to maintain monthly kitchen budget and soaring prices of veggies have made it dearer.""Providing a well-nourished diet to children is now limited to only the rich people,"" said Kiran, another homemaker.Another housewife, Shazia said the government should control the prices of vegetables, especially during the festival season.""At this time of the season, a large amount of vegetables and fruits are required. Increasing their rates to earn profits and putting common man in trouble is unjustified,"" she added."

Rawat said fruits have also become a luxury for the lower middle class. Ironically, he said, one spends less on buying a litre of fruit juice than a kilo of fresh fruits.The survey said 86 per cent of the respondents said that rising food prices had made their life tougher."

The agriculture ministry is trying to schedule the opening soon,"" said a spokesperson from the CM's office.The delay in the scheme's launch, which may now coincide with the start of Ramzan, lays bare that the government's intention is political mileage rather than a desire to help the common man.On July 5, TOI had questioned if this intervention was just another election gimmick. That it is indeed so, has been proved even before the scheme has got off the ground.The delay comes even as special government stalls across Mumbai and Thane had stockpiled 10 tonnes of vegetables for distribution. Cooperative stores had also made space for vegetable consignments.APMC director Sanjay Pansare, who is coordinating the food scheme, gave a similar timeline for different reasons. ""Around 4,000 large crates required for distribution will arrive on Monday or Tuesday.

The delay comes even as 10 tonnes of fresh vegetables are ready for distribution at special government stalls across Mumbai and Thane. Cooperative stores have made space for this consignment as well.Since the last three months, retail cartels have been charging customers four times the wholesale price for food items. To counter this, the government, last week, promised to open 100 temporary stalls to sell fresh farm produce from APMC at prices 30% lower than market rates. The first 10 centres were to start functioning on Monday.In Maharashtra, the Lok Sabha and assembly elections usually take place within a few months of each other. With the next set of elections coming up 2013-end or early 2014, the state government seems to be trying to squeeze political mileage out of every little thing.Recently, the inauguration of the Eastern Freeway was held up as the state government waited for some worthy from the Centre for its inauguration even as the a rained-out city waddled through waterlogged roads.On Sunday evening, Congress MLA Baba Siddiqui negotiated with APMC director Pansare to operate a similar scheme in his Bandra constituency.Anil Gangar, chairman of Apna Bazar, which will host eight such stalls, said the one at Andheri may open informally. Initially APMC will despatch one tonne of items to each of the 10 centres. ""This will include 500kg of mixed vegetables, 200kg potatoes and 200kg onions. We will gauge the requirement and then regulate the consignment in days to come,"" Pansare said.This paper was the first to raise the question whether the state government's plan to supply vegetables at discounted prices was just another political gimmick. And we have been proved right by the deferment of the scheme, ostensibly because the chief minister cannot be in the city to personally inaugurate it on Monday. Coming at a time when people have to buy a quarter kg of vegetables for money that used to fetch 1kg or more, this blatant attempt to tailor relief to suit the ruling party's political agenda is even more shocking. It lays bare the sheer insensitivity and opportunism of a government whose leader comes across as a mere politician more than willing to sacrifice basic governance at the altar of populism."

Worse, it could touch Rs 100 per kg next week, predict vendors. Prices of onion have doubled while that of potato tripled. Onions are costing Rs 30 per kg and potatoes Rs 30-35 per kg.

The state has added one more centre - a consumer store inside the Mantralaya compound - to the list of co-operative outlets where the veggies will be sold.Reacting to the government's move, by Monday afternoon, greengrocers outside the proposed subsidy centre at Andheri's Apna Bazar had halved rates to Rs 40-50 per kg and were pleading with customers to ignore the state outlet and buy from them instead. When this reporter approached them as a buyer, they not only decreased rates by the minute but offered 1 kg of lady finger, cluster beans (gavar), cauliflower, french beans and ridge gourd (karela) for Rs 40 per kg, after first quoting Rs 60.""We are not scared of competition from the government. But compare prices at that centre and at my stall, and you will find I offer a better deal. More produce is flooding the market now that the rain has reduced, so naturally rates have begun to fall,"" one of the sellers said. The rates stood at Rs 80 per kg last week. Prices at this spot had fallen to Rs 60 within a day of the government's announcement. However, elsewhere in the city, where vendors are not in competition with the subsidised stalls, veggies continued to cost Rs 80 per kg.Reader K A Viswanathan called from Matunga market and reported a vast difference in prices at Sahakari Bhandar, a co-operative store, near Aurora theatre and the retail market outside Matunga railway station on the Central Railway.Near the station, tomato was selling at Rs 60 per kg, potato Rs 25, and onion Rs 30; even bitter gourd (karela) was priced at Rs 60. However, the co-operative store sold potato at Rs 19.50 per kg, onion at Rs 23 and cauliflower at Rs 39. Of course, the quality differed owing to poor storage and spoilage. ""There are nearly 100 vegetable vendors near the railway station, and because the produce there is fresh, train commuters get off at Matunga station and buy vegetables,"" Viswanathan said. At Borivli east, all vegetables cost a notch higher than elsewhere. Sanjay Pansare, director of the APMC wholesale market, said each of the 11 subsidy centres would initially receive one tonne (1,000 kg) of supplies. ""Of this, 500 kg will be mixed vegetables, 200 kg potato and 200 kg onion,"" he said. Apna Bazar's most popular outlet, in Andheri, barely requisitions half that quantity every day. ""We are receiving so many inquiries about this sale that we are hoping to empty out stocks. In a day or two, supply will be tailored to suit demand at each centre,"" said Anil Gangar, chairman of Apna Bazar.Apna Bazar in Mulund will have special decoration, with government banners, lighting and special racks for stocking vegetables on sale. Uday Gandhi, assistant manager, said, ""We have earmarked an open area near the entrance. We will have a huge rate card on display, lights, racks to store products, electronic weighing machines, and our men will regulate crowds."""
146,Government school lunch is hot potato ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130709/jsp/jharkhand/story_17093811.jsp,2013-07-09,Telegraph,"A maverick monsoon in Ranchi has robbed the midday meal of green nutrition. Damaged crops in the rain-drenched district has left government schools with not much option but to serve up the humbly cheap potato with rice and dal instead of the normal assortment of vegetables. While a supply crunch has triggered the unwelcome price rise, horticulture scientists are hoping that the situation will turn around by next month, when fresh crops are harvested in the vegetable bowls of Kanke, Bero, Pithoria and Lapung. Currently, a kilogram of every green vegetable is priced above Rs 25, while the vitamin-rich tomato is making a hole in the pocket at Rs 40-60/kg. The potato, fortunately, is still outside the mean league at Rs 12 a kg. Humlog ek saptah se sirf aloo kha rahe hai (We have been eating only potatoes for a week), complained Sandeep Azad, a seventh grader of the government middle school at Karamtoli Chowk, which has 406 students on its rolls. The Centre may be planning to train midday meal cooks on nutritional needs of a child, but its flagship scheme to stem the dropout rate in state-run schools has tougher challenges to meet. We have been rendered helpless by the soaring price of vegetables. Earlier, the quantity of green vegetables cooked every day was 20kg. Now, we have had to cut it down by half. We are supplementing the meal with 15kg of potato (instead of 8kg earlier) and soybean, said S. Prasad, the principal of the Karamtoli cradle. Members of the Mata Samiti, which prepares the midday meal, echoed the school head. Bachalog aloo khana nahi chahte hai. Par, majboori hai (Children distaste potatoes, but we have little choice), said Rupa Toppo as she peeled a large saucer of potatoes. Some 700 students at the middle school in Nagri are feeling the crunch of green munch too. Principal Ajay Kumar said that even a week ago the quantity of vegetables was more than two times that of potato. Now, it is the other way. We are hoping that prices will come down soon, he added. An eighth grader, Kailash Mahtos biggest draw at the Nagri cradle is the noon platter because his daily wage earner parents barely pocket Rs 2,000 a month. I like vegetables. At home, we dont eat vegetables. So, I come to school. But now, there is only potatoes for lunch, Kailash said. Prabhakar Singh, a scientist in the horticulture department, offered hope. Heavy rainfall soon after the advent of monsoon has damaged crops. So, the supply-demand ratio has been affected. The situation is expected to change in another 15-30 days, he said.

The huge disparity in retail prices at the subsidized stores and markets outside has outraged many consumers, who want fair-price shops in their neighbourhoods. Residents in most of south Mumbai, particularly Breach Candy and suburbs like Bandra, Lokhandwala Complex, Goregaon and even Jogeshwari, said retail rates in their areas have doubled in less than a month. They said prices in these areas were anyway higher than the rest of the city, as they were 'prime locations'.Bandra interestingly does not have any food mall or fair price shop. Given that most wealthy residents scarcely ask rates before buying, vendors have begun to overcharge to suit their whim. Shalmali Godse, who lives in Bandra Reclamation, says, ""The onion economy brought a government to tears but ridiculous food prices seem to be here to stay ever since. Just the other day I paid Rs 50 for a dozen 'elaichi kela'. A quarter kg of tomatoes costs Rs 25 in my neighbourhood and onions are priced at Rs 35/kg. Yet I do not hear a murmur of protest anywhere. The only way out for people especially in areas like Bandra-Khar, which lack fair-price supermarkets, is to perhaps adopt size-zero diets."" Shalmali said she couldn't remember when 250gm each of four vegetables added up to Rs 310, as it did last week.Residents of Gokuldham in Goregaon east said they had to pay absurd rates for basic essentials. ""Tomato costs Rs 80 per kg and lady finger Rs 120. I bought a single capsicum for Rs 15. My husband is so frustrated with this constant price rise he urges me not to bargain and merely pay up what the vendor asks,"" said Amisha Gupte.Surprisingly in Lokhandwala, Andheri, a supermarket which stocks second- or third-grade quality products, is packed with high-profile residents willing to pay Rs 80-100 for basic vegetables. The shop floor is filled with slush, but that does not seem to matter either. ""We do have an Apna Bazar outlet around 3km away and the Four Bungalows market is robust and reasonable, but it is much easier to just call in stuff on the phone,"" said Mithilesh Agrahari, an aspiring television actor. Roadside vendors, who arrive in tempos every morning and squat on street corners, charge Rs 80-100 per kg for all basic vegetables.Greengrocers near the National Park in Borivli charge Rs 5 extra on onions and potatoes and up to Rs 20 more per kg on all vegetables, though rates have started to climb down since the subsidy was announced. ""We definitely hope that when the list of outlets expands, our locality figures in it,"" said Swati Desai."

For the past few days,there had been a very low supply of the tomatoes,due to the incessant rains which had led to spoiled crops and high rates.Tomatoes,which were being sold at Rs 60-80 per kg in the mandi three days ago are now being sold at Rs 35-50 per kg on Wednesday. The grain market at Sector 26 received new stock on Tuesday after many days,which decreased the prices by 40%. According to GR Pillai,secretary of the grain market,We received around 1,000-1,200 new crates of tomatoes today and one crate contains 20 kg of tomatoes. Earlier,we were getting only 300-400 crates,but today,surprisingly,the quantity increased,so the prices have also come down.All the tomatoes have come from Himachal Pradesh. We have two varieties of tomatoes,the high-quality ones called himsona costs Rs 35,while the same tomatoes were being sold at Rs 60 per kg and above just a day ago. The rates of the hybrid desi tomatoes are Rs 20-30 per kg. The fluctuations in the market price entirely depends on the demand and supply, added Pillai.The rates of other vegetables like potato,onion,capsicum,lady finger etc. also came down on Wednesday. Lady fingers,which were being sold at Rs 35 are now priced at Rs 30. Bottle gourd was also sold at Rs 35,which came down to Rs 30 and the prices of pumpkin also came down by Rs 2 now,costing Rs 13. Onion prices have surged up to Rs 27 per kg from Rs 25 whereas potato rates were seen to be stable at Rs 15 per kg.Amarpreet Singh,Apni Mandi Supervisor said,After many days,the traders bought so many tomatoes to the mandi. Two weeks ago,Apni Mandi in Sector 29 had no tomatoes at all,because of no supply,so the demand for the tomatoes also fell in the past few days. Now the rates have automatically decreased on the arrival. The tomato prices have reduced by Rs 10. Today the rates for himsona are Rs 50 whereas the hybrid ones are for Rs 40,Yesterday,we were selling them at the rates of Rs 60 and Rs 50 respectively. Other vegetable prices have also reduced by Rs 2-3.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The neighbouring State is a major market and the strike completely halted the movement of goods, said a trader in the Mettupalayam Regulated Market. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) had called for a dawn-to-dusk strike in Kerala on Wednesday in protest against the police attack on LDF MLAs and protesters on Tuesday and also to press for Chief Minister Oommen Chandys resignation over the solar scam. The trader said Kerala was a major market for carrot, beetroot, radish, beans, potato and cabbage. With the strike, there were no buyers and prices of many of these produces crashed due to few takers. While some traders in the district purchased these vegetables, they quoted low prices.N.

The Ooty potato has a unique market all of its own and regular buyers would rather pay higher than buy the same product coming from other areas, he said. Regarding the crash in prices, he said the effect of the strike in Kerala was bound to be temporary and prices would rise again once goods began to cross the border.S. Anandan, a resident of Vittoppakovil Street in the district, said they had either sharply reduced the quantity or wholly stopped buying certain vegetables due to the steep hike in prices. While tomato and onion were around Rs. 8 per kilogram about one and a half months ago, their prices had increased manifold since then.Many of these are staple items for the middle class and they have all become increasing unaffordable. As a result, I have stopped buying fresh vegetables and switched over to dry vegetables like dry peas, black and white channa that are priced less but are not as nutritious, he added."

Islams comment comes in the wake of Dispur facing all-round flak following the release of a June 27 letter by additional chief secretary H.K. Das to former chief secretary N.K. Das on the exorbitant rise in prices of commodities, especially fish, egg and broiler chicken. The letter was released on July 6 through the directorate of information and public relations, Assam. We discussed the issue threadbare yesterday with officials of veterinary, fishermens cooperatives and the agricultural marketing board, on what led to the price rise and ways to contain it. An analysis of prices across the country showed prices in Assam were stable except that of onions. There are marginal differences in the prices, Islam told The Telegraph. Islam said he did not want to comment on the rates (tax department) of egg, fish and broiler chicken but an analysis of the prices showed there was nothing abnormal. I have asked officials to give wide publicity to the rates prevailing in Assam along with those prevailing in other states to the media to remove doubts in the minds of consumers. They can also check the rates on the Internet, he said. Among the decisions taken at the meeting was fixing the rate of onions and potatoes at Rs 27 and Rs 12 per kg to be sold through Amar Dukans (PDS shops), Shyam Lal Mewara, principal secretary, food and civil supplies, said. The prices will remain unchanged for the next 10 days, he added. There are 54 Amar Dukans in Guwahati and 2,447 across the state. These shops are also used to sell commodities at discounted prices by the supplies department during crisis. Mewara said representatives of the veterinary and animal husbandry department, Assam Co-operative Fish Marketing and Processing Federation Ltd (FishFED), fisheries department and Assam State Agricultural Marketing Board attended the monthly review of prices yesterday for the first time apart from representatives of OIL, railways and FCI. The new members have been asked to attend the monthly meeting and report to the minister the wholesale, retail, source and checkgate prices. They have also been asked to open as many outlets as possible across Assam to control the prices. I have directed the GMC commissioner to identify shops in municipal markets, which sell fishes, eggs and broiler chicken. They have also been advised to use mobile shops. An analysis of all-India prices revealed there is no remarkable difference in prices, Mewara said."

The present day CBI came into existence in April 1963 through an Act of the Central Government of India. The motto of CBI as enunciated by its founding fathers is Industry, Impartiality and Integrity. Over the years we have seen this premium investigation agency fall of its lofty pedestal and has come to be known as the caged parrot in the hands of our political bigwigs. There has hardly been a case of corruption in which political honchos were involved that has culminated in their conviction  be it Bofors scam, the fodder scam of Bihar, 2G scam, coalgate and so on. The CBIs performance has been clearly in violation of its motto. It has been often seen playing to the tune of the party in power.The Intelligence Bureau had come into being in 1885 to acquire information about Russian movements in Afghanistan. In the early 19th century, it was restructured to keep tabs on the Indian revolutionaries during the freedom movement. After 1947, the IB was placed under the ministry of home with the task to acquire intelligence on internal security, counter-intelligence and even external sources, till the RAW was raised in 1968.In 2008, in another Act by the Central Government, National Investigation Agency (NIA) was raised to investigate cases impacting the sovereignty, integrity and security of India with focus on terrorism and left wing extremism. The irony is that we have often found our intelligence woefully wanting in delivering timely and actionable intelligence. Now with the CBI pitted against the IB, it could further dampen our ability to acquire real time intelligence and fight the monster of terrorism and ensure security of India.The rights to life and justice are the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution. No right minded Indian would ever condone the killing of an innocent person, be it Ishrat Jahan or anyone else. At the same time it is imperative to understand that in the era of terrorism there are no defined lines of white and black. The terrorists and their modules operate only in the grey zone and thrive on the voices raised by activists who expect the security forces and our intelligence agencies to be in the public domain  a demand oblivious of ground realities. Britain with much deeper roots in democracy than India has its key intelligence agency, MI-16 operating in total secrecy for more than a century and continues to do so.Political bombIf Ishrat Jahan along with three others were picked up and killed in a staged encounter, it is hard to believe that with the IB officers being involved in providing leads, the top brass of the IB and the home ministry at the Centre were in the dark. These things are often communicated by the word of mouth. Was this information kept under wraps to be unleashed as a political bomb preceding elections, without even a feeble thought towards the national security? The former home secretary G K Pillai in his recent statements to the media has given the benefit of doubt to Ishrat since she was probably used by one Javed as a cover without her knowledge. It has also been reported that IB used Javed to lure the other two who were Pakistani LeT operatives. Intriguingly, it was during Pillais tenure as home secretary that the two conflicting affidavits were filed in Gujarat high court  the first named Ishrat as LeT operative, whereas the second omitted her name. Analysis of Pillais reported statements throws light on what ails our intelligence agencies  political/ bureaucratic control to use it to their personal advantage, ignoring the national interests.One has to fight a terrorist like a terrorist, especially when they have acquired the right to shoot first. It puts the security forces and the intelligence agency in particular at a grave risk. It is for this reason that the intelligence agencies are often given the right to operate under the veil of secrecy. Their misdemeanours are to be handled on the quiet without letting it became a case of public debate, ensuring justice to innocent victims, if any. The system has enough checks and balances and does not require a new ombudsman provided the hurdles of personal interest and politicking are swept aside.The new baby on the block, NIA simply decided to ignore the statement of David Headly that Ishrat Jahan was a LeT operative, terming it as hearsay. Even if the statement was made to CIA, omitting it from the report as hearsay sounds absurd and appears to be a by-product of our petty politics mould. The incident has no comparison to holding Ajmal Kasab in prison and taking his trial to conclusive stage. Each of such case has to be handled on its own merit  the national interests and integrity of India being paramount. India is already paying the price by not handling Masood Azars case in sync with our national interests. We were forced to let him go in exchange of the passengers of IC-814 and turned him into a hero with the Jihadists in Pakistan.The ripple effects of this episode have already surfaced in Punjab where a police officer with some activists came out claiming that police encounters during Punjab terrorism were staged. How convenient it is to forget that many innocent families in Punjab had suffered at the hands of terrorists and got wiped out for not meeting their diktats? The state had remained engulfed in fear till the police and the security forces restored normalcy. Those involved in the recent statements, did they ever speak out against terrorists when they were violating all norms of our society? Similar demands are awaiting to erupt in J&K where the security forces and the IB have been fighting shoulder to shoulder to ensure integrity of India, when in 1989, it was virtually deemed that Kashmir was lost. Terrorism in Punjab and J&K has been an off shoot of placing politicking over national security. When will our leaders learn from the past follies and keep the nation first over petty vote bank politics?(The writer is a retired Major General in the Indian army)"

The company and its advisors are in early-stage talks with several FMCG companies as well as a clutch of consumer-focused private equity funds.Confirming the development, Balaji Wafers MD Chandu Virani told ET: ""An FMCG company with presence in this category will seek that we offload majority stake and continue to run the company for at least next five years. They would meanwhile continue to buy out leftover stakes until they understand the business completely. There could (also) be PE partners who would buy 25% stake.""Even though the promoters are keen to retain a partial stake after selling majority control in the company, most of the potential suitors have made it clear that they would ideally want a 100% stake. Depending on the final valuation, the promoter family too may consider such a proposal, said sources aware of the ongoing discussions. Global food majors PepsiCo, Mondelez, ITC and Britannia eye major stake in Balaji Wafers According to Virani, the unlisted Balaji clocked a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore in 2012-13 by concentrating on just five western states, and his advisors E&Y have valued the company at a significant premium of three-and-a-half times sales at Rs 3,500 crore. The company has plans to invest Rs 200 crore in the next two years to expand to the south and north Indian markets by setting up local manufacturing units. It has three units in Gujarat.Larger pan-Indian companies are interested in Balaji in order to gain access to a popular regional brand, its distribution and top line. The packaged salty snacks market is estimated to be at Rs 9,500 crore while the exact size of the unorganised snacks market is unknown. The nimbler operations play on low price points, indigenous flavours and quick turnaround time when it comes to replicating innovations by the bigger corporations.A Cadbury spokesperson said in response to ET's query: ""As a matter of policy, we do not comment on market rumours. In India, we operate in chocolates, biscuits, beverages, gums and candy. As a global business operating in India, it's not unusual for companies such as ours to get several such requests.""""We do not comment on speculation about M&A,"" said a PepsiCo spokesperson.The ITC spokesperson declined comment. Emails sent to Britannia went unanswered at the time of going to press.Over the past three decades, Balaji's strategy of marrying aggressive price and local flavours with distribution ensured that it was able to withstand intense competition from bigger players like Pepsi, Haldiram or even ITC. In their home market Gujarat, Balaji has a 90% share of the wafer market and 70% of the namkeen market.Industry players reckon that suiting specific palettes and flavours by offering the right product mix has been the other Balaji secret. So if its masala wafers or ""khatta meetha"" namkeen cater to the Gujarati sweet tooth, for Maharashtra the focus is on ""chaat masala"" and for Rajasthan it's been a spicy portfolio of snacks. These products then ride on a network of 700 distributors, 8 lakh stockists and 400 farmers who supply potatoes to the company through contract farming across three western states to maximise its reach.In Gujarat alone, the company operates over 150 trucks and 3,500 minivans. ""The Balaji wafers or namkeens come for as less as 1 and 5. That's an unbeatable proposition and even forced MNCs to change their Kurkure strategy. For value-conscious consumers, naturally, they have become a household name,"" said the CEO of a leading snack food company.""For any bigger player, Balaji could offer a considerable play in the Indian namkeen market. They are dominant in the highly urbanised western states that have higher disposable income and a large vegetarian population,"" said Asitava Sen, senior director and head of food & agribusiness research and advisory, India, Rabobank Group.This is not the first time Balaji has courted suitors. ""Three years ago, PepsiCo had a couple of rounds of talks. But the negotiations fizzled out, mainly on valuation,"" said a company insider. But now, with the second generation of the Virani family not keen to pursue the family business, the owners may finally sell out, added an investment banking official close to them. He spoke on condition of anonymity.Newer entrants to the snacks food market like the country's largest biscuit maker Parle Products is unlikely to consider a bid. ""But Mondelez may be looking at packaged snacks as a logical extension to its business in India, and could be interested in the deal,"" said an industry official.""Compared with an industry average of Rs 80-100/kg, Balaji's operating gross margins are just Rs 20-30/kg. That's unsustainable if you are looking to scale up the business,"" said a senior official from a rival multinational highlighting the potential hurdles to the deal. ""Aligning their distribution to that of ours may be a problem because they deal directly with distributors, not necessarily through organised channels,"" added another CEO of a top food company that has been identified as a likely suitor.After its negotiations with Balaji, Pepsi, for example, restructured its food division to set up a mass-priced, low-cost traditional business under its Lehar brand, mainly to fend off regional competition. PepsiCo leads the organised salty snacks market with its Kurkure and Lehar namkeen brands and may desist paying top dollar."

Are you uneasy about all those chemicals in your veggies? Do you ache to bring a green relief from the concrete eyesores that hem you in? Perhaps a solution could be turning a corner of your home into a kitchen garden.Garden City has always had gardening enthusiasts. But, as gracious homes with vast backyards make way for glass-and-chrome edifices, Bangaloreans are looking at more modest spaces to have a go at gardening. So todays green thumbs have a go at it through vegetable and fruit patches they grow in their backyards, terraces and even balconies. Kitchen gardens dont cost much and dont require a lot of time too. Depending on the varieties you want to grow, just an initial investment of Rs. 2,000 can get to started.Jayanagar resident Vijay Satish says his organic garden meets 90 per cent of his kitchen needs.He is proud of his brinjal, cucumber, chillies, coriander, fenugreek, tomatoes, beetroot, turnip, carrots and radish. I go to the market only for potatoes and onions!He even experiments with exotic varieties of vegetables like broccoli, Chinese cabbage, brown zucchinis, purple capsicum to name a few. He minimises the costs of his terrace garden by recycling almost everything he can lay his hands on  plastic sheets, disposal barrels, even noodles cups. Ask him if having green fingers is a prerequisite, he replies: Its not rocket science: anybody can do it. But gardening certainly requires patience and self-motivation.Online communitiesSocial networking sites like Facebook are proving to be a great boon for enthusiasts who want to make their house greener but dont know where to start. Members of online groups share their experiments, pictures and techniques, creating a pool for newer members to learn from.

People should not be swayed by the tricks of the UPA government, Gangte said.Other political parties, including the Manipur unit of the BJP and CPI, have also criticised the move to introduce the Food Security Bill, calling it the vote security bill.Gangte said 1 litre of petrol costs nearly Rs 70, 1kg of potato Rs 30, 1kg of onions Rs 35 to Rs 45 and prices of all the other food items have increased manifold in Manipur.Can we survive on rice or wheat only? How can we afford other food items? Gangte asked.She said in West Bengal the price of chicken was fixed at Rs 150 per kg on the intervention of chief minister Mamata Banarjee.In Manipur, 1kg of chicken costs Rs 220 to 250 because the government has not taken any initiative to fix prices of commodities, especially food items.When there is a road blockade, petrol pumps are shut. The state government is not taking the issue of price rise seriously. The people should stand up against the faulty policies of the government, Gangte said.Reacting to the Opposition criticisms regarding the Food Security Bill, government spokesperson and consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister Moirangthem Okendro Singh clarified that the UPA governments honest intention was to help remove hunger, poverty and malnutrition from the country.Instead of politicising the issue, all the Opposition parties should cooperate and make suggestions to the government to make the food security programme a success, Okendro Singh said.The state government would soon take a decision to implement the food security scheme in the state, he added."

The authorities have been maintaining a close watch on the prices of vegetables and have issued rate cards for the convenience of customers.City magistrate, MP Singh said, ""We have been closely monitoring the prices of vegetables at vegetable markets on routine basis"". During the ongoing monsoon, the prices of vegetables have skyrocketed in the last couple of days upsetting many household budgets.Vendors at bakshi bandh wholesale vegetable market on Sunday claimed that the prices are fluctuating due to monsoons but there was adequate stock of vegetables. For instance, the price of one kg potato at bakshi bandh wholesale market is Rs 16-18 while the prices of one kg tomato is Rs 40.The district administration has asked the vendors to submit the list of vegetable prices and warned for strict action if anyone tried for black marketing. ""Prices of all vegetables including potato, tomato, onion, brinjal , gourd pipe, jack fruit, bitter gourd, ginger, garlic, capsicum, etc are ok since district administration have initiated corrective measures"", said Soni, a housewife adding otherwise it was difficult to manage things when a kg of tomatoes were sold at the Rs 80.

167,Trucks roll into Imphal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130724/jsp/northeast/story_17147890.jsp,2013-07-24,Telegraph,"Imphal, July 23: The scarcity of essential commodities in Manipur is likely to ease in the next few weeks after trucks and oil tankers stranded in various parts of Assam owing to landslides in neighbouring Nagaland, started entering through Jiribam. Official sources here said more trucks carrying petrol, diesel, kerosene, cooking gas and foodgrain entered Jiribam along National Highway 37 and they would reach Imphal in the next few days. Manipur Rifles and India Reserve Battalion personnel escorted the trucks from Jiribam with more supply vehicles likely to come through this route. Heavy landslides caused by incessant rain blocked the Imphal-Dimapur highway at Phesema, about 12km from Kohima, stopping movement of supply trucks for the past 10 days. A 200-feet stretch of the highway was swept down to a distance of 500-600 feet into the valley. Though the Border Roads Task Force has been working round-the-clock, it would take a few weeks to reopen the road, a source said. The decision to divert the stranded trucks towards Jiribam from Assam was taken by the Manipur government after the visit by Union minister of state (defence) Jitendra Singh to Tamenglong on Sunday to check the condition of the road. More than 300 goods-laden trucks were stranded in various parts of Assam and Nagaland because of the roadblock. The stranded trucks started moving from Jiribam for Imphal. More than 100 trucks and oil tankers left Jiribam at 10 this morning. More trucks will come through his route until the Dimapur road is reopened, an official source said. However, the vehicles would take nearly a week to reach Imphal, as the condition of the 222km Imphal-Jiribam (NH37) is very bad. Major portions of the highway is muddy and slippery making it difficult for movement of heavy vehicles. The trucks will take at least five days to reach Imphal, a truck driver said. The condition of the highway has deteriorated during monsoon owing to poor maintenance and slow progress of construction by the Border Roads Organisation and the road is also prone to landslides. Official sources said the stock of petrol and diesel in Manipur was running out. Most of the petrol pumps frequently shut down as no supply came from the IOC depot here. One litre of petrol is allegedly being sold for Rs 120 in the black market. School van services were also affected by the fuel scarcity. Prices of food items went up considerably in the last few days with 1kg potato costing Rs 30-35 and a kilogram of onion selling for Rs 40 to Rs 45."

Picture by Ashok Sinha At Rs 12, one would get only a plate of sattu in the city during lunch or dinner. Raj Babbar, the actor-turned-Congress spokesperson, said on Wednesday while explaining the Planning Commission estimates on the urban poor that a full meal is available at Rs 12 in cities. However, the ground reality is different. The Telegraph on Thursday visited some of the roadside eateries, which cater to the needs of daily wage earners  the principal constituent of the urban poor. A minimum of Rs 20 is required for one meal if one wants to eat at these spots. Those willing to enjoy their meal at a dhaba or some other eateries need to shell out more. Input costs have gone up manifold in the past several months. We sell food at a minimum margin because we cater to the lower segment of the society, said Meera Devi, who runs a footpath eatery near Gandhi Maidan. One plate of food at Meeras place consists of rice, cereal, one vegetables dish and a quarter of roasted papad. A piece of green chilli and salt are given free to those having food at her eatery. Meera also offers a non-vegetarian delicacy of rice and fish curry that comes at Rs 25 per plate. But there are very few takers for it. I sell around 20 plates of non-vegetarian food in a day while daily consumption of vegetarian plate is around 60, Meera said. Madan Mahto, who has a similar kind of joint on the pavement of Beer Chand Patel Marg, has something more interesting to offer. Even Rs 20 is too little to sell a plate of rice and vegetables. I am thinking to increase the price as the cost of vegetables has gone up. Even potato is coming for Rs 16 a kg. I hope my customers would understand the problem, he said. A small survey of such joints revealed that the only option available for the below poverty line (BPL) urban poor is having roasted gram flour (sattu) with water, onion, chilli and salt. It comes for Rs 12 per plate which consists of 250gm of sattu. A good number of rickshaw-pullers eat it regularly, said Ram Prasad who runs one footpath eatery along Mangles Road. Asked whether he can spend the whole day spending just Rs 33  a figure deciphered by Babbar  for two square meals, rickshaw-puller Rajesh Thakur said: It is mockery of people like us, he said with a smile. Even the state Congress leaders are not happy with the Planning Commission report. State Congress chief Ashok Choudhary said: I cannot go with the Planning Commission figures. The state government is also annoyed with the Planning Commission report. Food and consumer protection minister Shyam Rajak said the figures have been released without taking into account of the socio-economic ground realities of the state. In Bihar, if a person residing in the rural area earns Rs 778 per month or less would fall in the category of poor. The corresponding figure for urban poor is Rs 923 a month."

But self-help groups supplying midday meals are expected to pull of such a wonder.The 80-odd midday meal suppliers hired by the state are provided 5.80 per meal for every primary school student and 6.18 per meal for every upper primary school pupil. The rates paid to the women's self-help groups, though hiked last year, are far from catching up with the spiralling costs of pulses and veggies in the Goan market.It is no easy task churning out the menu of pao bhaji, sheera and pulao fixed by the state with a pao costing 2.50 for the self-help groups at wholesale rate; oil at 60 per litre, essential bhaji ingredients like onion, potatoes and tomatoes priced at 31, 20 and 40 per kilo respectively, even at wholesale rates.While rice is supplied by the government for the meals through the Food Corporation of India, increasing costs of labour and transportation make it tough for the self-help groups-all commercial ventures and not charitable organizations-to earn their meager profits.""The state government has raised the price per meal paid to us. But the rate of the rising inflation also has to be considered. When I started out supplying the meals nine years ago, grams cost me 16 per kilo, today it costs 34 per kilo. Besides, we cannot use domestic gas cylinders since we are commercial ventures and have to use commercial cylinders that cost 1,560 each,"" explained a Taleigao-based self-help group member.A supplier, whose group, consisting of seven women, supplies meals to 14 schools, said that the only advantage for the group's members is being able to earn some extra money without having to leave their homes.""With much difficulty, we are able to save Rs4,000 to Rs5,000 per member. The only advantage is that we are working from home so we can manage housework side-by-side. Students in other states eat khichdi, but in Goa the children prefer pulao which cannot be made from the rice supplied by the government,"" said a self-help group member.It is a fine balance to be drawn for the midday meal suppliers between serving quality meals and being able to make it a financially feasible deal to enter. Adding to their worry are the central government guidelines that need the suppliers to ensure that within Rs5-6 per meal a primary school student is provided with 450 grams of calories and 12 grams of protein, and an upper primary school student gets 700 grams of calories and 22 grams of protein.In a Porvorim school, only a one-and-a-half food steel dabba is dropped off on Friday morning for an enrolment of 80 students. ""The day pulao is supplied, the quantity is smaller as children find it too dry and take only a small quantity. The children prefer pao bhaji. The day it is supplied, the bhaji or pao often fall short,"" explained the school's teacher.After two incidents, in Usgao and Canacona, of children complaining of nausea and being treated after consuming midday meals, the chief minister and education minister Manohar Parrikar at a meeting with parents held early this week suggested tying up with charitable organizations to supply quality meals like ISKCON does in Karnataka.""I would not mind paying something extra for such ventures and even if the school itself wants to supply the quality meals,"" said Parrikar.With protein-filled ingredients like chawli (local bean variety) costing the suppliers as much as Rs75 per kilo currently, it is a difficult balancing act for the women's self-help groups supplying the meals. And for less than Rs10-a-day only a charitable option can be explored, as suggested by the chief minister.(Names left out on request)"

While the fervour to fast is undiminished, rising prices have taken the flavour out of the feast. The variety of dishes during iftarbreaking of the fastwas once the highlight of Ramzan. This year, however, it has been more about sticking to the basics. Not surprisingly, the spirit of this holy month, also called the month of abundance, has dimmed to an extent.Raisa Bano, a homemaker in Old Delhi, lamented that even basic ingredients of iftar like bananas cost at least for Rs 40 a dozen, papayas went for Rs 40 a kg, and assorted fried spinach, potato and onion savouries had touched Rs 120 a kg, making it a drain on the daily budget. Fruit salads are now bereft of additions like pineapple, pomegranate and even sweet potato.""Mutton has almost touched Rs 400 a kg and chicken is pegged at Rs 180-200 a kg.

Her son Imran Baig, who runs hardware business, conceded that daily night outings, which were usually a long affair with several rounds of chai, are now done once a week as special tea costs Rs 10 a glass at most of the stalls. ""Either one can feast with friends or ensure a decent sahari for family. It can't be both this year with sahari staples milk, pheni (vermicelli-like savoury) and bread prices spiralling,"" he affirmed.The elderly are worse off as their health doesn't permit them to fast. A retired government employee explained he has to pay fidya every year as a compensation for not being able to fast due to heart problem. He used to ask his local restaurant to feed any needy person two meals a day as his fidya. ""This year, the eatery is charging me Rs 25 per meal. With two meals a day, my monthly fidya will come to Rs 1,500,"" said the pensioner.Firoz Bakht Ahmed, a prominent social commentator of the area, felt declining food quality, coupled with rising prices, has added to people's problems. ""The quality, nutrient value and even the visual appeal of fruits have been dented despite the rise in prices,"" he sighed.Salman Ahmed, who travels especially to Old Delhi every Ramzan for enjoying nihari at Bara Dari in Ballimaran, was shocked to see the final bill this time. He also blamed the shopkeeper's mentality for the woes.

For the majority of citizens, going vegetarian during Shravan has never been costlier. Onions, available for Rs 16 a kg 15 days ago, sold at Rs 40 in the Boring Road area on Monday. Vendors in many localities demanded Rs 45 for an equal amount. Similarly, the price of tomato has doubled to touch the Rs 50-a-kg mark. Vijay Kumar (48), a resident of Ramakrishna Colony in Bazar Samiti, said: It has become difficult to buy vegetables these days. The skyrocketing prices have forced us to purchase less quantity of vegetables. Earlier, I used to purchase one kg of tomato, but now I have to manage with 250gm. The situation is the same with most vegetables. At Mushalhapur Haat, where large quantities of vegetables are sold at lower rates everyday, buyers could not get any respite. If you have come here to buy vegetables at lesser price, you have made a mistake. Prices are almost same everywhere, Brajkishore Yadav, a vegetable seller at Mushalhapur Haat, told this correspondent. Shobha Kant Jha (55), a Bakarganj resident, visiting the market to purchase cheap vegetables was left stunned. I could easily have gone to Anta Ghat near my house but I thought of buying veggies at lesser prices here. They, however, cost the same here. I just wasted my time and energy travelling 4km from home. I have stopped eating vegetables such as bitter gourd and pointed gourd. They are too expensive. It is better to eat potatoes and ladies finger. The Telegraph tried to probe the factors that led to such price rise. Agriculture department expert Anil Kumar Jha said: In Patna, most vegetables come from the diara area. The swollen Ganga is preventing farmers from bringing their veggies to markets in the state capital. Parts of the diara are submerged, which has also cut the supply line. Supply of vegetables such as potato and bottle gourd from districts like Nalanda and Vaishali has dwindled too. The prices will remain constant for another 20 days at least. Some homemakers have been forced to mull cheaper alternatives to vegetables. I think tomato puree, which comes nicely packed, is an affordable and better option. I know it does not have the natural taste of tomato, but we have to manage until the vegetable prices do not drop, said Sushma, a homemaker residing in R-Block."

Comparatively,onion prices are fluctuating because they come from Maharashtra. Earlier available for Rs 24 per kg,they now cost around Rs 27-30 per kg. The whole sale market rates of potatoes was Rs 12 per kg,while prices for brinjal stood at Rs 25-30 per kg and peas at Rs 30-35 per kg.The rates are likely to decrease in another few weeks as the supply would increase,added Pillai.However,in the Apni mandi the rates were comparatively higher.

174,"On cue from subsidy,market stoops to conquer",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/on-cue-from-subsidy-market-stoops-to-conquer/,2013-07-31,Indian Express,"In three weeks since the state government rolled out outlets across the city to sell vegetables at subsidised prices,the difference between the market prices and governments discounted prices for most essential vegetables has steadily shrunk.When the scheme was first launched on July 9 with 10 such outlets,the prices there were roughly 30 to 40 per cent lower than retail rates. However,with the subsidised prices now having risen slightly for certain vegetables and the market prices having reduced,the difference has diminished to 10 to 15 per cent,as per store owners of the subsidised vegetable centres.The state government dispatches a price list for all the 24 items that are part of the subsidised vegetables scheme to all shops on a daily basis. As per Tuesdays price list,okra was being sold at Rs 48 per kg,while the market price was Rs 50 to 60 per kg. Brinjal was being sold at a subsidised price of Rs 36,while the market rate was Rs 50-60 per kilogram,and carrots were sold at Rs 24,as against the market rate of Rs 30-40.In the case of some vegetables,subsidised and market prices were almost equal. For instance,while the price of onions as per the state governments list was Rs 30 per kg on Tuesday,the retail price of the commodity was Rs 30-32. Similarly,the subsidised price of potato was Rs 15/kg,while the market rate was between Rs 14 and 16.Even though the scope of these centres is limited,as they are open for just four hours,it is definitely pressuring market prices in the area, said Kishor Desai of Supari Baug Madhyavarti Grahak Sangh,which runs a subsidised vegetable shop each at Lalbaug and Parel.There are more than 80 centres that sell vegetables at the state government-prescribed subsidised price in the Mumbai metropolitan region. Of these,27 are set up and operated by the state government or volunteer groups,the rest are operated by supermarkets that have pledged to sell vegetables at the governments rates. The subsidised vegetable centres get the days supply by 3 pm and operate between 4 and 8 pm.Initially,most vegetables were sold out by 7 pm. Now,the demand has more or less stabilised with more centres being set up. The entire supply is sold by 8 pm,but people dont have to go back disappointed, said Anil Gangan,chairman of Apna Bazaar,which manages nine subsidised vegetable centres.However,vegetable vendors claim that the state-run subsidised vegetable centres have not pinched their pockets as they are fewer in number and their regular customers still continue to buy their household requirements from them. They attribute the fall in market prices to the increased rain and better supply of vegetables.Our prices have certainly fallen,since the beginning of July,but it is mainly because during heavy rain,the shelf life of vegetables is shorter than usual. So,we have to sell entire stock. To do that,we have to lower the rates, said Dayaram,who owns a vegetable shop in Sion.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Grown mostly inregion of the remote tribalanddistrict ofPradesh, hops may soon be replaced by other crops due to lack of buyers.LahaulLahaulSpitiHimachalLahaul is the largest producer of hops in the country and its production has almost stopped in the valley since it was introduced in 1973. Used as flavoring and stabilising agent in beer, hops are losing sheen among Lahaul farmers as countries like USA and China are selling their produce at much cheaper rates. Prices of hops have dipped to Rs 100 per kg from a high of Rs 250 per kg. A record 131 tonnes of hops was produced in 1994, but it has now dropped to less than 20 tonnes, sources said.Farmers said they got over Rs 50 per kg for fresh hops. One kg of dry hops, derived after drying about 4 kg fresh produce, was fetching up to Rs 250. But now, the average rate for fresh hops from Lahaul has dropped sharply to Rs 20 per kg. Though growers have formed Lahaul Hops Marketing Society to help market their produce and get good prices, international competition has pushed the local trade into a slump.Managing director of the society, Amrit Lal, said that low import duty on hops from abroad was hurting the market for Himachal produce. ""Companies prefer cheaper products. Lahaul has the potential to produce quality hops in large scale, but it is losing market due to lower rates,"" said Lal.Only 400 farmers are cultivating hops in the entire Lahaul valley. They are cultivating this green flower only to prevent it from getting extinct from the region, sources said.""Our produce has more alpha acid content than the Chinese hops. However, USA has better crop than us. Cheaper price of foreign produce is attracting buyers from India so we are not able to sell even a few tonnes,"" said Prem Nath, a hops grower in Pattan valley. Despite efforts by the state government to ensure good prices to farmers, they were unable to recover even the input costs for hops cultivation, he said.""I have kept some plants to preserve the seed. Growers in our area supply their produce to a Baddi-based processing plant, which is unable to sell it at competitive costs,"" Prem said.The area under hops cultivation has reduced from about 200 hectares to less than 60 hectares in the last 20 years, sources said. Production of hops will completely stop in Himachal in the next few years. ""We have uprooted all hops plants. It has no future in India where importance is being given to products from abroad,"" said a disappointed Raj Kumar, another farmer from Pattan valley.Lahaul had some cultivators, who were producing two-three tonnes of hops annually, but most of them now prefer peas, potato and cauliflower. China, USA, UK, Germany, Australia and Czech Republic are the main producers of hops."
177,Blockade marathon begins,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130805/jsp/northeast/story_17196395.jsp,2013-08-05,Telegraph,"Guwahati, Aug. 4: Traders here are worried that the strikes and road blockades called in Assam by seekers of separate states might soon lead to a scarcity of essential commodities. Kamrup Chamber of Commerce, an umbrella organisation of wholesalers here, has expressed apprehension that the region might feel the heat of the statehood movements, as it largely depended on goods imported over roads and railways from outside. The consequent short supply would lead to a further spike in prices of essential items. We equally depend on railways and roadways for importing goods. If the two highways (NH31 and NH31A) that connect our region with rest of the country are blocked, supply will definitely be hit. It will largely impact the supply of perishable items and their prices in the market. This, in turn, will affect markets in the rest of the Northeast, as these always depend on the wholesale markets in Guwahati, Dipak Bajoria of the chamber told The Telegraph today. Hundreds of trucks carrying food items from different parts of the country enter the Northeast through two inter-state checkgates at Chagolia on the NH31 and Srirampur on NH31A in lower Assam. Every day, around seven-eight truckloads of fish from Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh cross the Srirampur gate. Traders here said at least 12-15 truckloads of potatoes and onions are transported daily through the two routes, though the two items are also transported in railway wagons. Absu, Peoples Joint Action Committee for Bodoland Movement, All Koch Rajbongshi Students Union and Kamtapur Association have already announced highway blockades. Though AKRSUs 100-hour blockade began today, it has not had any significant impact yet. Jayanta Deka of the Assam Chamber of Commerce, another trader organisation, said, If a truckload of perishable goods like fish or potato is stuck for two days, these will rot and traders will have to incur huge losses. In such a situation, they will be left with no other option but to hike prices to make up their losses. Our government should immediately take steps to ensure that the strikes are withdrawn and there is no impact on supplies. Farmers and vegetable traders in Kharupetia in Darrang district (vegetable hub), which is likely to be badly hit by any strike supporting the Bodoland movement, are also worried. They said strikes might impact their daily business of Rs 10 lakh, as they depended entirely on road transport to sell vegetables in Guwahati, Siliguri, Shillong and Upper Assam markets. Abdul Hanan, a trader in Kharupetia, said, If vegetables are stuck on the way to markets, we will lose lakhs of rupees daily, as we have to transport goods on a daily basis.

The rates have shot up in the wholesale and retail markets due to a variety of reasons ranging from inundation of agricultural fields to a drop in supply from the neighbouring States and hoarding by suppliers at every level of the supply chain.While onion prices have already touched the Rs.70-Rs 80 per kg-mark in some South Delhi colonies, tomato prices have also risen dramatically over the past week from around Rs.35 per kg to Rs.50 per kg. Apart from this, the prices of green chilli and lemon have shot up to Rs.100 per kg from Rs.60, while ginger is selling at Rs.250 per kg, up from Rs.180 per kg.Worse still, trade analysts insist the upward spiral is not about to end just yet. Looking at the market trends, traders pointed out that in the coming days retail onion prices can soar up to Rs.80 per kg. If this continues, the retail prices could touch Rs.80 in the next week or so, said Azadpur Mandis Onion Merchant Traders Association president Surendra Budhiraj.Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (Azadpur) chairman Rajinder Kumar Sharma said the prices will only start to fall when the monsoon comes to an end. We always see a rise in prices during monsoon since it is difficult to transport vegetables during this time. However, the monsoon appears to be receding in the South and this will mean our stocks will reach us on time, he said.Wholesale prices for tomatoes in the Azadpur Mandi ranged between Rs.27 and Rs.16 per kg; for bhindi (ladys finger) between Rs.27.50 and Rs.12.50 per kg; and for the modest potato they have hovered around the Rs.20 per kg-mark.With a shortage of 629 tonnes of onions this year that is pushing up the prices, a concerned Delhi Government had said a week ago that it may open stalls to make available onions at reasonable rates in the event prices continue to soar.However, prices continued to rise unabated with residents in East Delhi such as I.P. Extension getting their supplies for close to Rs.60 per kg. Since the mandi is very far and the produce in Mother Dairy outlets is of poor quality, we have no option but to buy from the vendors who charge indiscriminate prices, said a resident of the area.Another reason for the rise in the prices, as pointed out by a vendor, was that many traders  including wholesalers, retailers and vendors  have started stocking up to earn higher profits. Knowing full well that the vegetable prices are on the ascendancy, the traders are keeping their stocks and only releasing small quantities. This is leading to an artificial scarcity which is further pushing up the prices, said a vendor."

""Like drought, heavy rain also affects the harvest leading to rising prices. Rain have badly affected vegetable supplies,"" said a wholesaler, S Michael Swamy of Gandhipuram Market. The high prices will survive until the next harvest, he added.Vegetable merchants say the rain has damaged crops in Nilgiris, parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, which supply around 60% of vegetables to the state. ""This is not for the first time that prices have skyrocketed. Each week there is a considerable jump in prices,"" said retail vegetable seller S J Kathiresan. It is not uncommon for the prices of vegetables to register a steep rise due to factors such as rain, he said. What is alarming is the extent of increase in prices of most vegetables.In the retail market, carrots are priced at Rs56 per kg, ginger at Rs170, chillies at Rs 70 and beetroot at Rs38. Retailers say the price of pointed gourd has increased to Rs 22-25 a kg from Rs16, bitter gourd at Rs 25 a kg, ladies finger at Rs 52 a kg, while bottle gourd and sponge gourds are sold at Rs28 and Rs27 a kg.Even small onion prices have soared to Rs500 a kg and potato to Rs35. Apart from households, restaurants and hotels too are affected. ""Usually, we provide four vegetable dishes with the normal meal. But due to skyrocketing prices we had to cut one or two vegetable dishes every other day,"" said a city restaurant owner.

""We used to get at least three loads per week and now it has reduced to two truck loads,"" he said. Each truck load brings 10 tons of onion to the city. There are about seven wholesale merchants who deal with onion and potato here. The wholesale price ranges from Rs 50 to Rs 52 and it retails well above Rs 60.On a brighter note, Iqbal says: ""Once the crop from Hubli arrives, possibly within a fortnight, the prices will drop.""Vegetable merchant at Central Market David D'Souza says: ""Retail rates as on Monday touched Rs 64."" He said barring onions and green chillies, the prices of other vegetables has actually reduced by a few rupees.He attributed the festive season of Ramzan and Nagarapanchami for the demand in green chillies which has led to the rise in price. Mangalore gets green chillies mainly from Chikmagalur district.Hoteliers say that there will not be any change in the menu rates since this type of see-saw of prices goes on throughout the year. ""We cannot increase the price just because onions, which is one of the major ingredient in our preparations, has increased. In the next few weeks, it will go down like the price of beans did,"" said Ramesh, a caterer."

On the streets, food vendors are making do without onions.Vegetable vendors blame the rain for spoiling the crop which in turn increases the price. They also said that so long as middlemen are there, prices cannot be controlled. ""Why is the government not monitoring the middlemen in vegetable markets?

The cost shot up from an average of Rs 755 a quintal last year to an average of Rs 3,417 per quintal this year.The wholesale price this month peaked at Rs 51.50 per kg on Monday,before dropping to Rs 46 per kg by the end of Tuesday.Prices are high due to poor crop yield in the state. They are likely to remain high till October when the kharif crop comes into the market, said Ashok Valunj,Vashi APMCs head of the onion and potato section.Maharashtra is the countrys top onion producer,contributing nearly 28 per cent of the total supply. Overall,onion production in the country dipped this year due to drought and inclement weather. In 2012-13,the total onion production in the country fell by 4.89 per cent. The output in Maharashtra,however,plunged 15.81 per cent.There is a definite shortage in the market. Traders who have stocked onions are exploiting the market,knowing that new produce is not going to enter the market before October, said Narendra Kor,an onion farmer from Lasalgaon,the countrys largest APMC said.In July this year,the Vashi APMC received 1.88 lakh quintals of onion,19.94 per cent less than the what it received in July 2012. Prices rose 213 per cent from an average of Rs 703 a quintal in July 2012 to Rs 2,194 in July 2013.State agriculture department officials said they were prepared to crack down on hoarders.

Having seen traction, it's an enthusiastic marketer to the rural niches now.In simple terms, rural niche is India's spread-out hinterland wealth driven by commodity circles and increased economic activity. ""The rural opportunity is an ocean of niches. There is not one rural, but thousands of rural niches. Each niche is an opportunity,"" brand expert Harish Bijoor said.""The initiative to identify niche segments was to take the rural drive to the next level. The idea was to go granular in our approach. We found that there were numerous small segments within the economy that were doing better than the rest,"" said Mayank Pareek, COO (marketing and sales), Maruti Suzuki India. This calendar, the auto major will add another 30-plus niche markets for greater rural penetration.Jewellery and saree retailers down south have followed a similar strategy after analyzing sales data in the nearby cities of Kochi, Tiruchirapalli, Coimbatore and Kozhikode.""Kerala's leading jewellers - Malabhar Gold, Kalyan and Bhima - have 20-25 stores across the state. The state doesn't have 20-25 cities that go on the map in terms of population,"" said Amit Bagaria, founder chairman of Asipac, a real estate and retail consultancy firm, who has tracked the emerging tier-II retailing. ""We know of similar trends in neighbouring Tamil Nadu,"" he added.During the telecom boom, mobile operators had similarly latched on to hidden niches - for instance, the fishermen on the long coastline - to improve penetration. Even global alcoholic beverages companies have tapped into the rural niche story, from wealthy farmers in Punjab to prosperous planters in south India. While brands like Famous Grouse scotch whisky have mopped up bulk of their India sales from Punjab, LVMH Moet Hennessy has targeted commodity planters in the south to boost sales of its Hennessy Cognacs.Financial services have tracked the rural wealth, keeping tabs on commodity prices. ""Every time there is a spurt in the price for any one commodity, you will see heightened activity in stock broking. You know which commodity is doing well because the stock-broking activity emanates from specific commodity-growing areas,"" said C J George, MD, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services, which closely tracks rubber, pepper, coffee and cardamom prices in the southern states.Analysts believe it makes sense for retailers to look at identifying specific rural segments sliced by both geography as well as occupation. Private and nationalized banks have chased Kerala's Gulf money, with particular focus on certain districts. For instance, the banking reach in Pathanamthitta, in central Travancore region of the state, is remarkably high. ""This town, by far, sees the highest number of bank branches per person in the country,"" said George."
186,‘Can’t do much about onions’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130817/jsp/odisha/story_17240172.jsp,2013-08-17,Telegraph,"The price of onion has soared to a record high, necessitating intervention of the government, which is selling the essential commodity at wholesale rates from fair price shops. Do you think your department has been able to control the situation? No. In just one month, the price of onion per kg has shot up from Rs 26 to Rs 47, an increase of nearly 80 per cent. We have no control over this kind of price rise. Onions are coming from Nashik, Maharashtra. We are yet to get supply from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. By the end of this month, we expect the availability of onions in those markets to increase and the situation to improve. Had the government of India stopped export of onions for a couple of months, the price would have stabilised. The state is trying to intervene at the retail point so that middlemen do not try to make profits unscrupulously. What steps are you taking? We are procuring onions directly from the wholesalers and selling them at fair price shops through our retailers. Our price is about Re 1 or Rs 2 more than the wholesale rate to cover the cost. This will continue till the end of this month. Why is the state not arranging for storage facilities to control onion price rise, which has become an annual phenomenon? The government of India removed onion and potato from the list of essential commodities before 2005, as they were not staple food. Now it includes rice, pulses, oilseeds, sugar and kerosene. The prices are monitored at four to five locations across the state and the report is sent to the Centre. However, as far as onion is concerned, we cannot do much because there is no declaration of prices, no control order. We are intervening as onion was earlier an essential commodity and people expect the government to come to their rescue. Our measures may have marginal impact but consumers will be saved from unscrupulous traders to some extent. The state government is dissatisfied with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for poor evacuation of surplus rice from its godowns and wants it to make space for rice procured from the state. What is the current status? Our requirement for public distribution system (PDS) and welfare schemes is about 22 lakh metric tonnes. But in the past five years, we are procuring surplus rice. Now it has reached to 37.6 lakh metric tonne. There is no way to sell it as it comes from the central pool. The FCI was procuring all the extra rice till 2003. After that, Odisha became a decentralised procurement state. As a result, our dependence on FCI reduced and we started procuring rice directly from farmers. However, FCIs performance this year has been very good. Will Odisha benefit from the Food Security Bill? Odisha will not benefit much. Our total allocation will reduce marginally. However, we need to identify beneficiaries individually and not family-wise. Each individual will be allocated 5kg of rice, instead of the present 25 kg per family, irrespective of the number of members. Since the BPL survey is hopeless and the socio-economic survey is not ready, identification of individuals will take time. When the Bill becomes an Act, will it reduce Odishas fiscal burden? Once implemented, Odishas fiscal burden of Rs 1,300 crore because of the Re 1 rice-a-kg scheme will reduce by 50 per cent, which is around Rs 600 crore. However, the overall assessment is yet to be made. Bhubaneswar was once said to be the emerging IT hub in eastern India. What is the current status? We are on the right track. Mindtree will soon open its unit here while TCS has promised to expand its unit. We also hope that Infosys will expand. Export of IT software for 2012-13 is about Rs 1,960 crore. Have you ever faced political pressure in your functioning? I have never been under pressure to do something illegal. What do you feel about Uttar Pradesh chief minister suspending IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal, who took on the powerful sand mining mafia in Noida? Have you come across a similar incident in Odisha? There have been suspensions and transfers on many occasions. But nothing like the Durga Shakti case has taken place here. The morale of an officer has been blunted by an action, which appears illogical and illegal. As an alumnus of the prestigious Sainik School, what do you feel about its present academic standard? I am concerned about declining standards. In our time, we had a motivation for achievement, which is lacking among students now. This generation has access to television, the Internet and mobile phones, which might have had a distracting effect. Now parents have many options of schools. Moreover, Sainik School now charges Rs 30,000 to Rs 35,000 per annum, which is much more than the annual fees of many public schools. Metallurgy to public service Enterprising and practical, Madhusudan Padhi, 50, is a senior IAS officer in charge of two important departments  food supplies and consumer welfare, and information technologyPadhi, who hails from Bhadrak, studied at Sainik School in Bhubaneswar. Though he had qualified for IIT, he chose to pursue graduation from the Rourkela Engineering College (now National Institute of Technology, Rourkela) to be able to take up the subject of his choice  metallurgy. He worked at DHL for four months and then with the National Aluminium Company (Nalco), a Navratna public sector unit for close to five years before qualifying for the civil servicesThe 1991 batch officer has served as collector of Kandhamal, Balangir, Koraput and Khurda, in that order. He has headed the department of tourism and culture, school and mass education and higher education. He was also the state project director for the Odisha Primary Education Programme AuthorityPadhi left for the US on a sabbatical in January 2011. After completing a course in public administration from Syracuse University, he returned to Bhubaneswar and soon after, got his present posting in the food supplies and consumer welfare department. He was home secretary for some time and was then moved to ITPadhi is a tennis enthusiast. His wife is a college lecturer WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN HAD YOU NOT BEEN AN IAS OFFICER I was working with National Aluminium Company (Nalco) before joining civil services in 1991. Had I not qualified for the services, I would have continued there. I was never really interested in the IAS in my college days, but I opted for it because a job in industry was monotonous. The relationship between the supervisors and workers was becoming a little too difficult to adjust to. The management was not really keen to protect the officers. But that was just one of many factors that led me to prepare for the IAS and I got through in my second attempt"

On the occasion ofNew Year, one gets to see the best of all this.NAGPURParsiParsi""We Parsis are heavily non-vegetarian and enjoy our Dhansaak and beer on lazy Sundays,"" says Edul Bhagawagar, an elderly city businessman. But on new year it is more elaborate. ""A must have on our tables is patra ni macchi, a pomfret wrapped in banana leaf. But that quality of fish is not available here and whatever is available is so expensive that now we have replaced it with chicken and mutton delicacies,"" he informs.There are many other dishes which are not prepared in Parsi kitchens even on new year now, says octogenarian Threaty Jall. ""Dishes like Popatji, a deep fried sweet savoury item, levati no patiyo, a dish prepared from mud fish, eda pak, a sweet prepared with eggs, pure ghee and sugar and vassano made with 40 ingredients and loaded with dry fruits have just about vanished,"" she says. ""For convenience sake many homes resort to buying ready-made stuff or preparing simple recipes like Parsis rawa and sandwiches,"" she adds.The dishes may not be very traditional but food is prepared the Parsis way, says Shernaz Daver, a retired schoolteacher. ""We prepare fish in tomato gravy and salli chicken that is chicken cooked with potato strips and daal ni pori."" Daver says that as new year sees a constant flow of guest, the food items are mostly snacks. ""For new year, keema samosas, kebabs and confectionary items have now become the norm.""Describing the feast as the right mix of traditional and popular dishes, junior college teacher Parizad Major says, ""For the typical Parsis touch we have dishes like Kopra pak and patrel. With our non-Parsis friends visiting us and this being Chaturmaas period, we also include many vegetarian dishes.""Not just food, the entire tradition of having an open house on new year is on a decline, feels Dilnavaz Bhagwagar. ""Now people go out of the city or restrict it to just a few friends. This is sad as youngsters who have gone away from the city always remember these parties,"" she says.Attributing this trend to absence of domestic helps and escalating prices she adds, ""Dishes like boomla no patro and tikko gosht were savoured by us as each home had its own speciality. Now we stick to dhaan and dal which is white rice and simple daal with a fish preparation as fish is considered auspicious."""

189,Tunda and sarkari kebabs,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Masquerader/tunda-and-sarkari-kebabs/,2013-08-20,The Times Of India,"The first question from a well-meaning security officer who nabbed Tunda (T) should have been, Kitne dallors hain?. Even if he had said teen it was worth it. If he had none of the foreign currency, no point wasting the exchequers money arresting him. The prodigal son of the soil has returned with a tamarind beard and perhaps the same spectacles with which he left the land years ago. Just let him be. You can get all this headline stuff when he tells his stories to his grandchildren, in his native Pilkhuwa, a town close to Delhi, known for its hand-printing business for decorating bed sheets and upholstery. You may just appoint any villager to attend the evening meeting when he tells his bedtime stories. Dont make a demon of the D company, just because your own intelligence is so convenient at matters of national security.There is another D that is making this country sleepless. The dollar seems remorseless in beating the pulp out of the rupee. I can understand a slide of 45 to 47, make it 50. At the present rate of 62, the rupee seems to have retired, even beyond an extension! As officers of the finance ministry tighten their belts, and order others to do so, they find that indeed the notch where it would fit, has slid three or four slots downstream. Call it inflation or whatever, the asymmetry is showing. Ever worn a belt on a lungi, or tucked lungi on a belt? No, you wont understand why SRKs Chennai Express gave some cheers to the economy and much more to the depressed masses. The lungi dance as shot by director Rohit Shetty was the largest paisa vasool item. The whole trick lies in the fact that although it is a dance like any other, at each step you are so drastically close to a devastating wardrobe malfunction! I believe, one can buy spot tickets, any number, if one is to pay in dollars!The turbans are still as tight and starched and worn at the same fixed angle. Perhaps the spirituality of the norm, as endorsed by the Panth gives the desired strength to move on. No doubt about that. These men have seen so many storms in the Indian economy, that they can still row the boat to some other tax-less shores, some other islands in wilderness that may just feel like investing in one of the largest consumer markets in the world. Even if you were just to make a chip, i.e. a potato chip, just add up the numbers. If it can go to a silicon chip, well the world shall come to salute Incredible India!The common man doesnt understand economy, which is one reason it is so easy to fool him. Not exactly. The message here is that some concrete steps have been made on the approach road to the Parliament, and the North, South, East, West blocks respectively. This was not on first come first served basis, but auctioned after being duly cleared by the CAG. With an easier access to each of these citadels, via the parliamentary canteen, a ten point program has been made. Why ten?. Because when they made twenty, a previous government fell. Making six or seven or seventeen sounds that one is out of ones mind. Ten is a good number. One for each year of rule, and it is easy to remember what was missed out when.Why not just have a one point program? Stupid, thats exactly what has been happening to make us see this day!Some dignity restored this Independence Day when the President, perhaps a finance minister for more terms than anyone one else and to more governments too, announced that India is the largest exporter of rice, and second largest of wheat. Sure enough, with good rains this season, and no reigns at all in the monsoon session, this prophecy may continue to be true for years. I have a strong feeling that some Presidents are a net loss of talent to the Union Cabinet. We could have had Kalaamji, who as a rocket scientist could still work his equations with a paper and pencil. The present one can just offer tea and the protocol two biscuits, twice a year in the highest chair in the country. As a politician he could have served you, biryani, hilsa, sondesh, prawns, not to mention Kakori and Tunda kebabs!"

During the auspicious month of Shravan,when they eat only one meal a day,prices of vegetables have shot up,some even rising by 100 per cent in the past two months.While the retail price of onion has climbed to an astronomical Rs 70 a kg,that of seasonal vegetables like ridge gourd,sponge gourd,cluster beans and brinjal are scaling newer heights with each passing day.At present,retail prices of most seasonal vegetables range between Rs 50 to 80 per kg,while that of cluster beans (gavar),little gourd (tindora) and capsicum have already touched Rs 100 per kg.While both wholesale and retail vendors cite inflation and excess rainfall as the major reasons for the hike,they hope that this phenomenal rise will stablise in the coming weeks.With heavy rainfall being witnessed in June,vegetable prices started shooting up. It is true that this despite being the month of Shravan,where the demand of vegetables,especially onions is less,prices have continued to soar. Unlike previous years,where city would witness rainfall at the end of July and August,this year the supply of vegetables have not been regular, said Govind Prajapati,a retail vendor in Vastrapur.It is a blow for all. Even prices of essentials like potatoes have increased to Rs 20 per kg. This has caused a hike in prices of almost every farari (snack) items as well, said a visibly agitated housewife in the city.On the high prices of onions,Kishore Paryani,a wholesale vendor of onions at Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC),Vasana said,The main reason for it is the delayed and deficient rainfall last year. Wholesale prices have shot up from Rs 10 in May-June to now Rs 45-50 per kg. It is very difficult to say if the prices will fall,but we are certainly expecting good crops in the coming weeks due to the healthy level of rainfall this year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Bulls-eye. And yes, that too.On the Marina and Elliots, you can have eggs made your way. Sunny side up, spread over a dosa or as a bread-omelette slathered with green chutney.No other shoreline in the country probably has as varied a choice of gastronomic delights as the citys beaches.With their large variety and more than reasonable pricing, the seafood stalls on Elliots Beach can give any specialty restaurant a run for its money.Marinated, spicy, succulent fillets of vanjaram (seer fish) vie for space with whole jilapi (tilapia), sankara (red snapper), mathi (sardine), nethili (anchovy) and shrimp, crab and squid.And the stalls have their share of regulars.Eating seafood at the beaches is a cheaper alternative to going to a restaurant or cooking at home, said Madurai native Venkat, biting into his third fish of the evening.Tens of thousands throng the Marina and Elliots beaches on any given day. While weekends are for family outings and large-scale get-togethers, on weekday evenings, the beaches are the refuge of college students and young office-goers in pursuit of some privacy and romance.And in between sweet nothings and stolen glances, young lovers share a plate of crispy bajji and piping hot tea.Business is brisk, said Lakshmi, draining a fresh batch of molaga bajjis from a deep wok of sizzling oil. She is one of the more than 1,000 food vendors who earn their livelihood on the Marina.While they continue to cater to people from all walks of life, the management of the beaches  especially vendor control and hygiene  leaves much to be desired, said restaurateur M. Mahadevan.On Tuesday evening, Mahadevan met with the health officer of the Chennai Corporation to offer his services in raising hygiene awareness on the Marina.I am ready to set up a prototype of a model food stall on the beach and educate vendors on the need to maintain cleanliness, he said.Mahadevan has fond memories of evenings on the Marina, back in the 80s. When I was dating my wife, we would often drive down to the beach and eat ice cream from the pushcarts and munch on sundal, he said.With the right efforts and political will, the character of the citys beaches could be preserved for generations to come, he said."

The prices of vegetables have shot up, some even rising by 100% in the past two months.While the retail price of onion has climbed to Rs 60 a kg, that of seasonal vegetables like gourd, beans and brinjal are scaling newer heights with each passing day.At present, the retail prices of most seasonal vegetables range between Rs 60 to 80 per kg, while that of capsicum, cauliflower and carrots have already touched Rs 100 per kg.No vegetable except bitter gourd (karelas) and potatoes is available less than Rs 60 per kg in the retail markets.The situation is such that the retail prices vary from shop to shop and worst affected are the people living either in the periphery of Hamirpur town or in the villages. In villages, there is no check on rates and people are openly fleeced by traders.With prices of vegetables going beyond the reach of the common man, especially poor and middle class people, they have switched over to potatoes and soybean products as their daily food.Potatoes imported from Punjab mandis are being sold between Rs 14 and Rs 18 per kg in retail. Their wholesale rate as per the market committee report is around Rs 940 to Rs 1,200 per quintal.The rates of ""desi"" potatoes which are procured from Lahaul and Spiti are quoted around Rs 25 per kg in retail and Rs 1,200 to Rs 2,000 per quintal in wholesale.Though the Hamirpur district market committee releases the daily rates to the people through media, there is no check on the rates of traders by the department of food and supplies that is mainly responsible for maintaining the price line in their jurisdiction.The department allows 20% margin of profit to the retailers on the sale of vegetables and fruits. However, a random check on the rates supplied by the market committee shows that the margin of profit charged by the retailers is more than 50% to 60%.Sunita Sharma of Anu said, ""It has become difficult to run the kitchen."" Wife of a serving solider, who stitches clothes to run her family, said, ""I have brought down purchase of vegetables by 60%. I prefer to cook potatoes and ""moong"" and ""chana"" dal that are within my budget. There is no question of buying peas, tomatoes and cauliflower.""She blamed the authorities concerned for their inept handling of the situation and thereby harming the cause of poor. She said it was shocking to say that once known as one of cheapest markets of vegetables in the state, Hamirpur had now become costliest markets of the state.Another housewife Rameshwari Devi of Hamirpur town asked the district officers to visit the markets to buy vegetables and other foodgrains. ""Since they don't go to markets and every item comes to their house through their servants, they don't know the exact situation,"" she added.Surinder Bedi, one of the leading retailers of Gandhi Chowk area of the town, said, ""It has become difficult to sell the items on 20% margins as vegetables are perishable items. The margin should be increased.""Sushil Sharma, president of the Hamirpur district consumers' sangh, said strict action should be taken against persons not displaying price lists in front of their shops.A random visit to various shops of the town shows that price lists are not being displayed. Those displaying the lists too sell the items more that the prices printed or written on the list.Meanwhile, upset with the growing complaints of the people and sharp criticism of the state government in the HP Vidhan Sabha, Hamirpur deputy commissioner Ashish Singhmar has directed the food and supplies authorities to conduct surprise checks and book the defaulters under the law of land. He said no one trying to fleece the consumers would be spared and action would be taken against him/her under the law of land."

The warehouse in the facility has the capacity to store more than 1,000 tonnes of potatoes and a little more than 400 tonnes of fruits and vegetables. ""The project did not even have proper roads for trucks to enter the area,"" said Adhir Chowdhury, minister of state for railways. The railway ministry in a statement on Thursday said, ""Due to very low utilization, the service provider has abandoned the contract.""However, Concor is making a last-ditch effort to revive the project before it gets away with the projectat Singur.

This project was located far away from the market and could not find many takers,"" he said.""For example, there is a cold storage near Chapadanga in Hooghly. It was planned during the Left Front regime. But it failed to take off as it is not near the market,"" Roy added.Meanwhile, other perishable cargo centres of Concor in the state have also run into rough waters. The cargo centre near Siliguri, taken over by Concor in 2011 from Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority, is still awaiting a licence from the state agriculture department. The centre at Dankuni, being developed by Central Railside Warehouse Company Ltd, will be set up this fiscal after Railways hands over possession of the land."

It’s fine dining atop Dalma hills,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130826/jsp/jharkhand/story_17247907.jsp,2013-08-26,Telegraph,"The granite and marble kitchen gets ready to make your Dalma visit all the more delectable From a ramshackle shed to a concrete cooking centre. The kitchen at Pinderbera forest guesthouse atop the picturesque Dalma hills, some 40km from Jamshedpur, is making this journey of culinary convenience. The facility near the guesthouse entrance has come up at a cost of Rs 5 lakh. The kitchen slabs are black granite, while marble has been used for flooring. The dado boasts glazed tiles. There are two windows for proper ventilation and equal number of wash basins. The forest department sanctioned the funds and we wasted no time to build the new kitchen. It is neat and hygienic, said Mangal Kacchap, the range officer (in-charge) of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary. He added that the kitchen would start rustling up meals once LPG cylinders, burners, oven, pressure cooker and utensils were in place. Exhaust fans need to be installed too, he said. Three cooks will take care of a tourists hunger pangs. Heaving a sigh of relief, chief chef Munna Akhtar, who has been preparing delectable dishes for guesthouse visitors since 1987, said that the new kitchen would allow them to operate in a hassle-free manner. We have been cooking on dry wood. During monsoon, it is difficult to light the woods. Utensils are also in bad shape. The place where food is cooked is not clean and is a semi-open place. We are looking forward to using the new kitchen, he told The Telegraph. Tourists at Dalma often complain of slow food service. Cooking on a single chullah takes time, Akhtar explained, adding that the new facility was likely to open next week. Once the kitchen is operational, tourists will have the liberty to order anything of their liking  both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. The forest staff will be at their service and lay the table at the dining hall located on the ground floor of the guesthouse. The visitors will have to provide us with the ration, vegetables and non-vegetarian items. We can cook almost any recipe of chicken, mutton and eggs, smiled cook Shital. The dining hall also boasts a refrigerator. Thus, visitors planning to stay anchored at the guesthouse for a longer period can use it to store perishable items. Jamshedpur-based businessman, Krishna Rao, who is a frequent visitor to Dalma and the Pinderbera guesthouse, said he was delighted. It is a very good news. I always enjoyed the hot chapattis and crispy fried potatoes with my friends though we were a tad concerned about hygiene, Rao recalled. He added that he would visit the guesthouse with his family once the kitchen started functioning."

Why was the warning about the spike in onion price about two months back not taken seriously and no one responded to National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation's (Nafed) offer in June to procure and store onions at its cold storage complex at Nashik,"" he said.The price rise has put additional burden on the common man already being confronted with high inflation, he said.Slamming the government decision to put a cap on subsidized gas cylinders, Agrawal said people will give a ""fitting reply"" in the next elections.BJP member Balbir Punj said prices of onion has increased by 31% during the last one year as compared to the 16% rise in prices of potato and 18% spurt in the overall prices of vegetables. But, as compared to last July, onion prices increased by 145%, making it a ""luxury"" item, he said and blamed this on ""artificial shortage"" of onions created by hoarders.Comparing the existing state of economy with 'stagflation' where demand is falling but inflation is rising, he said the economic crisis was due to presence of a ""second government"" within the UPA government, the National Advisory Council (NAC).""This government should be thrown out lock, stock and barrel into the dustbin of history,"" he said."

A visit to the government schools in the city would show that students are not just getting good food but also variations in food items on a daily basis.The cook was busy rustling up rice, pulses, potato and egg bhujiya at Rajkiyakrit Prathmik Vidyalaya in Bada Ghaghra. With the aroma wafting in the air through the kitchen, students couldn't wait to dig into the food. Five-year old Anita Kumari, a student of the school said, ""We ate French beans and rice yesterday and today we will be treated to egg, potato fry and bananas.""Teacher of the school, Bani Kumari, said, ""Eighty nine children study at the school for which it gets around Rs 12,000 for every three months by the government. We are not able to give the best to children because we do not get sufficient funds. We are provided rice for free and given Rs 33.51 for every student but it is not enough.""Summing up the the expenses, she said, ""Wood is Rs 250/ kg and coal Rs 220 per sack. One egg comes for Rs 5. Not to talk of the prices of vegetables, which are going through the roof.""According to the food chart provided by government, every child should be given 100 gms rice, 20 gms pulses, 50 gms vegetables and 5 gms of oil. Another teacher Lusia Bada said, ""We try to give as much as possible but at times quantity varies, depending upon the funds. We often buy vegetables from our own resources.""Similarly, Upgraded Primary School of Jagaran Toli, where 40 students are enrolled but only 20-25 students attend class was provided long beans (bodi), rice and pulses for lunch. Neema Kachchap, a para teacher deployed at the school said, ""We are not cooking much food because there are few students but we make sure that students get green vegetables everyday. We even give jaggery (gud) to students after lunch.""Mahadev Hansda, state coordinator of International NGO Save the Children said, ""The condition of midday meal is good in and around cities compared to the interior villages of Khunti, Gumla, Simdega and other Red-hit areas of Jharkhand.""RTI activist Balram said, ""The state government and district administrations are doing their best to provide good food for the children but lack of funds from the Centre remains a major problem. Several schools in the state have fallen in the debt trap as they are forced to buy stuff from local shopkeepers without paying the full amount. An unstable government is a major hindrance in the way of file movement and approvals which leads to late release of funds.""Primary education director Mamta said, ""There are some lacunae in the MDM programme but the department is trying hard to solve them. There are certain problems at every level right from the Centre to blocks and we are trying to plug the loopholes. We are planning to constitute a separate authority to monitor the midday meal. Soon a workshop will be organized in which the roles of various stakeholders at MDM will be defined."""

They say fruit-rot disease has destroyed more than 90 per cent of the crop. Photo: Raviprasad KamilaHundreds of areca growers vented their anger against the government by dumping hordes of disease-hit arecanuts in front of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard here on Tuesday. Earlier they took out a procession in the town.The farmers led by All India Areca Growers Association were angry that the government has not given them any compensation for the losses they suffered because of kole roga (fruit-rot disease). According to the association, the disease had destroyed more than 90 per cent of crop.Demanding Rs. 50,000 per acre as compensation, the association urged the government to waive all crop loans and declare a special package for those growers whose plantations had been affected by yellow leaf disease.In a memorandum submitted to the district in-charge Minister, B. Ramanath Rai, the association said the arecanut growers had sold their produce at a rate below the production cost from 2000 to 2010. It forced them to go for crop loans. Though the farmers were hopeful of getting good price now, the disease had dampened their hopes.It said that excess rainfall in the season had affected inter-crops of cococa, pepper and coconut.Addressing farmers Ravikiran Punacha, chief convener, federation of arecanut and coconut farmers organisations of Karnataka and Kerala, alleged that the government had not given arecanut growers the importance it gave to those who grow onion, potato or tobacco.He said the State government brought areanut under horticulture department while at the Centre it was under the Commerce Ministry.Mr. Punacha said bankers were not sanctioning loans to areca farmers on priority. A.V. Theertharama, a farmer, alleged that the government was promoting only industries and neglected agriculture.Mr. Rai, who accepted the memorandum, said he would take up the issue with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.

This youth from Hyderabad, now a second year economics honours student at Presidency University and resident of Hindu Hostel, has always watched them appear late in the evenings after the shops down shutters and melt away by the time College Street turns into a bustling mass of humanity. Pranjal Rawat was so intrigued by them that he got along his batch-mates to carry out a unique survey on the lives of pavement dwellers living around his hostel and university.""I have worked with the rural poor in the past and have been a Right to Food activist. This is the first time I have worked with the urban poor. We worked with a sample size of 26 pavement dwellers. Several interesting facts came up during the study,"" Rawat said.Of those Rawat's team spoke to, 8% claimed they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The authorities apparently know this and pick them up whenever there is any disturbance in the neighbourhood. The Indian pavement dwellers also treat them with disdain, accusing them of being responsible for the lack of opportunities. Among those who helped Rawat are Sumanta Roy, Aditya Gupta, Anirudh Poddar and Sohoum Biswas.""On an average, an adult living on the streets has been doing so for 23 years. About 80% became homeless in the last decade while 8% have been living on the streets for over 50 years. We found that quite a few of those interviewed were actually born in the exact circumstances they are now living in. Nearly 70% of the homeless are employed, but don't earn enough to afford a home. Nearly 9% are on the streets as their families don't want them. Some are divorcees while the others are too old,"" Rawat added.What the youngsters found interesting is that begging is the sole source of income for only 11% of the homeless. The van delivery men seemed to be at the top of the economic ladder, earning nearly Rs 250 per day, followed by the masons and rickshaw-pullers. The worst off are the beggars and workers of a local powder factory who earn about Rs 60 per day. Only about 46% of the lot manage three square meals a day, the survey revealed.""A full meal roughly amounts to a plate of rice with potato curry. We started to wonder why the pavement dwellers couldn't afford three square meals a day when each plates cost only Rs 10-15. The reason, we found, was the number of mouths to feed. Most powder factory workers live alone and can afford three full meals a day despite their low incomes. In comparison, the rag-pickers and beggars live with families and experience chronic hunger,"" the student said.While nearly 35% don't have EPIC cards, 57% don't have BPL cards. A positive sign is that the pavement dwellers have access to public toilets and don't foul the neighbourhood. Nearly 60% said they faced harassment from the police while 15% faced trouble with traffic and rash drivers."

PHOTO: ReutersColombias largest cities were braced for marches by students and labour unions in support of a growing nationwide strike by miners, truckers, coffee growers, milk producers and potato farmers protesting everything from high fuel prices to free trade agreements that farmers say have them on the brink of bankruptcy.The protests began on August 19, with demonstrators joining striking miners, to block some of the countrys main highways using tree branches, rocks and burning tyres. At least one protester and one policeman have died in the demonstrations, dozens have been injured and more than 150 have been arrested.The protests spread to the cities where residents banged pots in solidarity with the farmers after President Juan Manuel Santos, in a failed effort to downplay the importance of the strikes, said the supposed national farmers strike does not exist.Forced to apologise for the statement, he sent out high level officials to begin negotiating separately with the different sectors. We recognise that the farmers protests respond to real needs and problems. We are listening to them and offering solutions, Mr. Santos said on Wednesday night.Farmers complain that agricultural imports allowed under free trade agreements with the US, the EU, Canada and other nations are undercutting their livelihoods.SolutionsStrike leaders said solutions offered  eliminating import tariffs on fertilisers, easing agricultural credit and triggering protective safeguards allowed under the free trade agreement for sensitive sectors  werent enough. Talks continue, strike leaders said in a statement on Wednesday, but called on farmers to continue protests.Marches are planned for Bogota, Medellin, Cali and other mid-sized cities.With access to cities from the countryside disrupted, the price of some staple foods has nearly doubled. Gloria Galindo, a mother of three who lives in Bosa, a working class district of Bogota, said she sympathised with the protesters but that the roadblocks were hurting her familys wallet.Vegetable prices have shot through the roof, she said.Officials have accused leftist guerillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which is in talks with the government to end nearly 50 years of war, of infiltrating the strikes. Strike leaders have denied the claims.Rural development was the first point of agreement between FARC and the government in the peace process. But the current protests show that Colombias conflicts are not limited to an armed insurgency and they wont necessarily be resolved at the negotiating table in Havana, according to Alejandro Reyes, an adviser to the government on land issues. When we get to a post-conflict stage there will be an enormous social conflict to deal with, he said.   Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2013"

Mohanan has directed officials to ensure effective market intervention to keep prices from spinning out of control during the festival season. Officials said a weekly review system had been introduced to keep tabs on the situation. They said the move to reduce the dependence on neighbouring States would help to keep vegetable prices in check.The Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp) expects its procurement to touch 250 to 275 tonnes a day during the peak demand period from September 1 to 17. Last year, the procurement was 110 to 125 tonnes a day.Procurement planThe entire requirement of plantains in Kerala during the Onam season is expected to be met by domestic producers this year. Horticorp Managing Director K. Prathapan said inland farms had hiked production of plantains in anticipation of the increased requirement.However, consumers in Kerala will have to depend on farmers in Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, and Madurai districts in Tamil Nadu for supply of green cooking banana (peyan), another staple culinary feature during the festival season.Dr. Prathapan said the maximum amount of pumpkin, cowpea, cucumber, bitter gourd, snake gourd, and elephant foot yam would be procured from farmers in Kerala, while drumstick, tomato, Indian bean (amara), onion, and other vegetables would be procured from outside the State.Dr. Prathapan, who is also director of the Kerala State Horticulture Mission, said efforts were on to procure carrot, cabbage, radish, and potato from farmers at Vattavada and Kanthalloor in Idukki district.Of the 3,000 hectares under vegetable cultivation in the two villages, crops in 300 hectares have been lost to rains. But the vegetables in 1,500 hectares are ready for cropping, he said.Meanwhile, Horticorp and the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) are priming their outlets across the State for the festival season.Apart from the 200 Horticorp markets, 140 Supplyco outlets, and 70 mega fairs in various districts, 20 mobile vans are being pressed into service to meet the additional demand.Dr. Prathapan said the network of Horticorp outlets was already selling vegetables at 30 per cent discount.VFPCK fairsOn a smaller scale, the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) is gearing up to procure vegetables worth Rs.7 crore for the Onam season. VFPCK Chief Executive Officer S. Sivaprasad said the total procurement over a period of 68 days from Ramzan to Onam was expected to be 500 to 600 tonnes. The VFPCK has set up 13 Mega Onam fairs in Kasaragod, Kannur, Palakkad, Thrissur, Malappuram, and Thiruvananthapuram districts.As many as 119 retail outlets will also be opened from September 5 to cater to the heavy seasonal demand. All the outlets will sell produce at 30 per less than the market rate.Mr. Sivaprasad said efforts were on to procure the maximum produce from domestic farms through the Swasraya Karshaka Sanghom (SKS) network of farmer clusters established by the VFPCK."

The produce would be collected by the Co-operative Societies. Besides, the farmers have the option to sell it to retailers or to vendors in Koyambedu wholesale market.According to one estimate, the department hopes to collect vegetables in the range of 56 to 65 tonnes per day. The farmers have offered to supply brinjal, greens, bhendi, banana, gourds, tomato, potato, beans, carrot and beetroot.So far, a batch of 20 farmers each had been formed 250 clusters for this purpose. The farmers are willing to supply greens, fruits and vegetables to the 29 Farm Fresh Vegetable outlets in the city on a priority basis.As per the schedule, the collection centres will be opened in Mallianguppam (Tiruvallur), Peerkangaranai and Chengalpattu (Krishnagiri), Thanipadi and Mothakkal (Tiruvannamalai), Keelvithi (Vellore), Allankuppam and Olakkur (Villupuram), Pollachi north and Thondamuthur (Coimbatore), Thalavadi and Areyapalayam (Erode), Palladam and Pethapambatty (Tiruppur), Annikorai and Kilkavatty (The Nilgiris).Prices slashedOn Saturday, the Co-operative Department reduced the price of seven vegetables at Farm Fresh outlets. Commensurate with market conditions, retail prices of Naveen tomato, Ooty potato, Ooty carrot, brinjal and drumstick have been cut by Rs.5 per kg. Prices of a kg ginger (old variety) has been reduced by 30 to Rs.110 and ginger (new) will be sold at Rs.70.Officials said that the retail sales at 29 vegetable outlets crossed the Rs.3.52 crore on Thursday. Nearly 1,300 tonnes of vegetables have been sold so far.Fresh arrivals to the Koyambedu wholesale market have brought down the prices of several vegetables. Retailers in the city said that vegetables such as tomatoes and carrots cost Rs.2-Rs.5 lesser than last week. While tomatoes cost Rs.15-Rs.20 a kg and potatoes are sold at Rs.16-20 a kg, beans and carrots are priced at Rs. 48 per kg. Ladies fingers cost at Rs.32 per kg.Onions, however, are still expensive. While those from Kurnool are sold at Rs.40 a kg, Nasik onions cost Rs.50 per kg. Wholesale merchants in Koyambedu said that fresh stock of onions has arrived from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and that have slightly brought down the price. S.Karthiga, a resident of Tambaram, said that she was able to plan her purchase better this week as many vegetables were cheaper than last week. I bought more of drumsticks, ginger and carrots as they are priced nominally, she added.More yields of beans, broad beans and drumsticks in the neighbouring States have also brought down their price. Consumers may expect the further dip in vegetable cost by Rs.2-Rs.5 per kg next month.Large quantities of produce are set to arrive at Farm Fresh outlets in Chennai"

The SSA is also trying to rope in neighbouring states for the effective application of the software.Once developed, the OOSC tracking software will go online with the 17-digit code of schoolchildren (allotted under Hejje Guruthu scheme) and their photographs.If a child is found missing from a school for more than seven days, teachers of that particular institution will have to immediately inform their higher authorities such as the block education officer (BEO) and the newly formed attendance authority.The information of the particular child in the database will be updated accordingly. The authorities will have to closely monitor the database for the reappearance of the missing child.If children in Karnataka drop out of school and move from one district to another or anywhere within the State, we will be able to track them with the software, said Subodh Yadav, Projector Director, SSA, Karnataka. However, once they go outside the States boundaries, there is no way of knowing their whereabouts.The SSA is in the final stages of developing the software and persuading Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu to instal it in their respective databases.This initiative will be mutually beneficial for Karnataka and other states. They will get an update on schoolchildren who migrate from our state and vice versa. As and when we can track them, we can take immediate remedial actions, Yadav said, adding that a letter in this regard had already been sent to these states.Numbers unclearAlthough the exact number of school dropouts who leave the State is not known, Yadav believes it is significant. In many border districts such as Raichur and Belgaum, significant migration takes place. Schoolchildren from such areas do not get traced anywhere, he said.Even ChildLine, a helpline for children in distress, receives on an average at least two calls every week from outside Karnataka about missing children from the State, G Nagasimha Rao, nodal supervisor of the helpline, explained.While the new seven-day definition of OOSC has greatly helped in the effort to address the issue, the aim is to use the tracking software. The inclusion of the neighbouring states is to ensure complete solution to the problem, according to Yadav.As OOSC becomes a hot potato for the department of public instruction, the SSA had recently announced a plan to conduct a fresh survey to establish the actual number of dropouts.In addition, the setting up of the attendance authority to check dropout rates has also been planned."
203,Benefit doubt over bumper potato plan,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130903/jsp/bengal/story_17305314.jsp,2013-09-03,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Sept. 2: The state government has decided to procure potatoes worth Rs 60 lakh from cold storages in an attempt to bail out poor farmers in the season of a bumper crop but several officials said the move would benefit only middlemen. Agriculture marketing minister Arup Roy today said: It has been decided that nearly 6 lakh kilos of potatoes at Rs 10 a kilo will be procured and then distributed free of cost in Jungle Mahal schools for mid-day meals. Nearly 6 lakh students will be benefited. The government today issued a formal notification to this effect. A section of officials in Roys department, however, doubted if the move would at all benefit poor farmers who lack the money to keep potatoes in cold storages. This is because small and marginal farmers have to repay loans, usually taken from local moneylenders. The middlemen use this opportunity to store potatoes after buying it from the farmers at a cheaper rate and thus they control the market, a senior official said at Writers. Asked about this, the minister said: It is not possible to ensure that only poor farmers potatoes are bought. We have launched the scheme to ensure that the states potatoes are not destroyed. Minister Roy justified the governments decision, saying: Despite exporting potatoes to different states, we still have around 33 lakh tonnes left in cold storages. Till the end of December, we will require another 18 lakh tonnes of potatoes. The remaining 15 lakh tonnes will have no buyer. We are trying to avoid such a situation. He added that more money could be allotted in the next few months to keep the scheme running. Jitendra Ghosh, a farmer in Hooghlys Dhaniakhali, said he had produced nearly 15 quintals of potatoes this year but was forced to sell it to some middlemen at Rs 3.5 a kilo in February. I could not store even a kilo of potatoes. Most of the farmers dont have the money to store the potatoes and if the government buys potatoes from cold storages now, the middlemen would actually benefit, Ghosh said. Senior officials at Writers said the Left Front government had in 2010 procured potatoes worth Rs 400 crore from cold storages following a bumper production, but it was found that the move hardly helped the peasants."

The alarming fact is that it is striking early in life, affecting young adults in their twenties and thirties. The morbidity associated with this takes away from the productivity of the country and adds to the surmounting cost of healthcare.A disease thought to be, primarily, due to deficiency of insulin in the body, concomitant resistance to the insulin action at the cellular level is another factor.Remember, the carbohydrates (sweets, rice, potatoes, etc) you eat are rapidly absorbed and metabolized (put to use) by the action of a hormone called ""insulin"". This hormone is secreted from the pancreas-an organ between the stomach and small intestines. Before the clinical onset of diabetes, the potential patient develops a condition called insulin resistance whereby, though there is adequate insulin, it is not put to work because of resistance to its action. In turn, more and more insulin is secreted to bring down the sugars.

They feel fatigued, have organ-related symptoms and finally develop complications and weight loss.What is the remedy? Since insulin resistance emanates from the fat around the waist (apple shaped), the first rule is to alter 'lifestyle'. Eat carefully, exercise (at least walk) regularly, shed weight and consult your doctor. While there are many medicines available, I will enlarge on insulin. Treatment means supplementing deficient insulin. In the yesteryears, insulin extracted from pancreas of cows and pigs was injected in patients. With advances, human insulin (made in labs from human cells) and synthetic analogues are now available. They come in all flavors-short, intermediate and long acting, in syringes with needles, in pen-filled cartridges, etc. These have become the lifeline of diabetics.Alas, though oral and inhaled insulin has been attempted, insulin is only effective in the injectable form (needles have become finer).Diabetes is now a way of life with families adapting to the prescribed ""Khatta Meetha"" lifestyle and living with this metabolic menace.

Hes surely seen enough of life to know that such adulation can quickly swing to the other end which will only be adding to the tremendous pressure he already is under. The job of RBI Governor is not easy in the best of times, and these are anything but that.Its been a good start alright but the test just begins for Dr. Rajan. Amongst the many that he will encounter in the days ahead, there are five trip wires, in particular, that he needs to watch out for.Managing the rupeeThats obviously the most immediate challenge. In his speech on Wednesday, Dr. Rajan hinted that he was willing to go out and bat on the front foot when he spoke of creating depth in the local currency markets to take on the overseas non-deliverable forward market for the rupee. The promise to examine the possibility of introducing interest rate futures on overnight rates and cash settled 10-year interest rate futures as also the internationalisation of the rupee show his willingness to play ball with the markets and speculators. He has to watch out for speculative bouncers though.Much as he may want to be proactive, the fact is that in the near-term at least, his strategies for the rupee will largely be reactive to the policies of the Fed. His decision to postpone the mid-quarter review by a couple of days to September 20 ostensibly to give himself more time to consider all major developments in the required detail demonstrates how the Feds policies will drive the RBIs own; the Fed will have a crucial meeting on September 18 where a decision on commencement of tapering is expected.Handling the fall-out of the tapering process is going to be Dr. Rajans first challenge. The dilemma will be choosing between retaining the existing measures imposed to support the rupee, which are having an adverse impact on sentiment, and loosening up and risking a run on the rupee. The markets will be closely watching the RBIs moves in the run-up to the mid-quarter policy statement.New bank licencesD. Subbarao has bequeathed the hot potato of new bank licences which he inherited from his predecessor to Dr. Rajan. Though new banks are desirable if only for the competition that they will bring, opinion is divided on the basic question of number of licences to be issued and how many of them should be given to corporate groups.Given the divergent views and the fact that some well-known corporate houses are among the 26 who have applied for licences, the RBI is unlikely to be able to please everyone. Dr. Rajan has a tough one on his hands. His speech hints at a liberal approach to granting new licences but how many will he grant now? The on-tap licensing he spoke of can also be interpreted to mean that only a few, maybe less than five licences, will be given now with the losers free to apply later. But by appointing someone with the credentials of Bimal Jalan as head of the committee to examine and recommend applications, Dr. Rajan has started well.Looming NPAsThe problem of bad loans is not something that has suddenly reared its head. The overweening ambition of promoters and companies to expand during the heady period of 2009-11 without giving a thought to basic fundamentals of demand and supply has resulted in bad loans, and numerous instances of corporate debt restructuring. Gross NPAs and restructured loans are estimated to be as high as 10 per cent of total loans outstanding  non-performing loans rose by about 14 per cent in just the first quarter of this fiscal to Rs.1,76,000 crore. SBI alone saw its gross NPA ratio shoot up to 5.56 per cent in the April-June quarter, its highest in the last nine quarters.With the economy slowing down considerably and GDP growth in the second quarter likely to be as bad, if not worse, than the first, corporate profits are likely to suffer with adverse consequences for loan repayments. This will indeed be a major problem for Dr. Rajan to tackle in the short-term; in the long-term, he has to take steps to blacklist defaulters from returning to the credit system. If individual borrowers can be monitored by CIBIL and blacklisted for defaulting over relatively small amounts, then there is no reason why large corporate borrowers and businessmen should not be given similar treatment. More so because their borrowings are large enough to threaten the stability of the banking system. Dr. Rajans remarks in this connection are encouraging, as they signal a zero-tolerance approach to defaulting-promoters and businesses. But then again, as with his other promises, he will be watched closely for action here as well.Incentivising savingsOne of the main reasons driving domestic investors to gold has been the absence of attractive investment options that take care of inflation. The stock markets have been indifferent in the last couple of years while inflation has been raging at over 10 per cent at the consumer level.In this backdrop, bank deposits have become unattractive as the returns, post-inflation, are piffling, and, sometimes, even negative, depending on the term.It is not surprising then that household savings in financial assets fell by half to 8 per cent in 2011-12 compared to 2009-10. The loss of the financial system has been the gain of gold and real estate, investment in which rose to 14.3 per cent of GDP from 13.2 per cent over the same period. Household savings as a whole has dropped from 25.2 per cent to 22.3 per cent with adverse consequences for gross domestic capital formation in the economy. Though it is not the RBIs responsibility alone, the central bank has to do whatever is within its powers to get domestic savings going again. Dr. Rajan has acknowledged this by proposing inflation-indexed bonds linked to the consumer price index, which reflects consumer impact better, rather than the wholesale price index, which was used hitherto. More such steps are necessary to wean retail investors back from gold and real estate.Protecting the turfThis will be a continuous battle for Dr. Rajan in the face of constant efforts from North Block to encroach on the RBIs territory. Hes not the first Governor who will face this problem, and he will not be the last. What is different though is that the pressures are now bigger given the slowdown in the economy. The report of the Financial Stability and Legislative Reforms Commission has put the central bank on the back foot, and Dr. Rajan will find it difficult fending off the governments yorkers from this position. But yet, he will have no option but to keep defending as his predecessors have done. He will be watched closest on this count.raghuvir.s@thehindu.co.in"
206,Direct sourcing thrives in Bengal,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Direct-sourcing-thrives-in-Bengal/articleshow/22473523.cms,2013-09-11,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: Though the Mamata Banerjee government has decided to allow big private investors to directly procure farm produce through Brihat Krishak Bazar Yojana, the system is already in place in some parts of the state.A visit by TOI to Goghra village in Bankura and Amdanga in North 24-Parganas showed that the system has also helped farmers and the market reap a windfall by weeding out middlemen.Domestic multi-retail trade, which touched base in Bengal about two and a half years ago, has changed the lives of farmers who embraced the new model of farm-marketing, selling their produce directly to retail giants like PepsiCo, Metro Cash & Carry, Big Bazar, Reliance and Keventer.While the picture in the traditional mundis or haats of Bengal has not changed in half a century, the six multi-retail collection centres at Amdanga are all about cellophane packaging, laptops, palmtops and the orderliness that gives an edge to is a feature of any business chain.With the government introducing Brihat Krishak Bazar, it's set for a big leap.Taraknath Kesh lost almost everything eight years ago when his potato crop failed. Just when he decided to sell off his land, PepsiCo approached him with a proposal for contract farming. He accepted it with a lot of doubt. But over the years, not only Taraknath, other farmers of Goghra village also followed his footsteps.Retail firms not only encourage scientific farming, but also buy the crop at a fixed price throughout the year.On the other hand, the long wholesale and retail chains of middlemen lead to massive cost escalation of the produce when it reaches the consumers. Thanks to the middlemen, farmers do not get the right price. They also suffer losses because of price crashes in the highly-fluctuating market.The same crop that often goes for peanuts in distress sale in other parts of the state, fetches big bucks for the Amdanga and Bodai farmers who supply it to the organized retail industry. Many of them are doing so well that they can indulge in the odd luxury and fulfill some dreams. Some of them have redone their houses with marble, others have bought LED TVs and motorcycles and even take vacations every now and then. Subhas Ghosh, a farmer in Bodai about 7km from Barasat, looked happy. His crops are directly picked by Metro Cash & Carry. There was no worry of the next morning - no chasing after vans to carry his produce, no hectic phone calls to know the retail price in Kolkata. He could sit back and watch a Bengali soap.Compare this with the hurly-burly in the nearby Kamdevpur Haat, where farmers in rickshaw vans are kept waiting for hours with their produce dumped on the ground. Everyone seems to get a different price. If the first lot of ladies fingers are sold for Rs 12 a kg on Monday, the next lot fetches hardly Rs 8 or 9 a kilo. The touts call the shots here. Farmers are at their mercy.Tomato grower Samar Senapati is glad that he is no longer a part of this chaos. He does not know the difference between Keventer - where he sells his crops - and Walmart. All he knows is that he has made enough money in the last two years to buy a motorbike. ""I have heard about FDI but I do not know how it operates."""
207,KITCHEN QUEEN,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130912/jsp/bengal/story_17340474.jsp,2013-09-12,Telegraph,"At a government programme in South 24-Parganass Sarisha on Wednesday, Mamata Banerjee focused on the prices and availability of essential food items instead of political rhetoric, demonstrating her awareness of the problems those running kitchens are facing. I apologise for taking a lot of time to talk about the problems of daily life that the common man is facing. Not every day does one feel like talking about politics. Today, I spoke from the heart instead, the chief minister said. Mamata mentioned four items, their use in the kitchen and offered solutions. ONIONS  Problem: Onions come from Nashik and other places in central India. We have to rely on imports, which push up prices. We lag behind in the production of onion.  Culinary trivia: Onions cant be grown everywhere. We could grow onions in Purulia and its surrounding areas but I was told by experts that most of Bengals onions are consumed at a very early stage  as spring onions. We love spring onions. We have them fried, in curries and chochchori. Delicious, isnt it, my mothers and sisters ?  Solution: Our agriculture, agri-marketing and horticulture departments have been asked to focus on onion production, encourage farmers and equip them with knowledge and technology for the production. If Nashik can, theres no reason why some of our districts cant. CHILLIES  Problem: Excellent chillies are grown in Bengal. I found out during a recent rise in chilli prices that the best chillies come from Haldibari in north Bengal and Canning in South 24-Parganas. But prices sometimes shoot up because of a shortfall created by the use of chillies in bulk in some products.  Culinary trivia: My mothers and sisters, dont we love chillies? We eat them raw, we eat them fried, we eat them dried, we eat them ground, we eat them powdered, we eat them in curry.... We just love chillies.  Solution: When there was a crisis,I immediately stopped their use in sauces and pickles. It is more important that the common man gets chillies for a meal of aloo sheddho and rice. If most of the produce is used up to make sauces and pickles, the problem will only worsen if there is a shortfall because of inclement weather. POTATOES  Problem: We are easily capable of producing enough potatoes for our domestic consumption but we rely on Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other places. Potatoes are sent by train, trucks or planes and the prices automatically shoot up.  Culinary trivia: Bengals own potatoes are excellent for aloo dum, aloo sheddho and other dishes. But we cant make chips from the potatoes grown here.  Solution: The agriculture department is working on improving potato production, while the agri-marketing department is trying to provide necessary back-up such as storage and marketing. Fish  Problem: We have excellent fish here, but we lag behind in their production. Where do we get most of our fish from? Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and other states. That is why fish becomes so expensive at times.... Hilsa comes at Rs 1,500-2,500 a kg sometimes. The best hilsa comes from Bangladesh. We catch our hilsa when they weigh 400-500 grams. At less than 1.5kg, they are never as tasty.  Culinary trivia: Machhey-bhatey Bangali  we simply cant do without fish and rice. Besides rohu, we love hilsa and prawn.  Solution: We have been encouraging fish production. That is one of the goals of the Jal Dharo Jal Bharo project. In every such programme, I dedicate a segment for those in fisheries. So that our dependence on Bangladesh for hilsa is reduced, I inaugurated a hilsa research centre in South 24-Parganas today. Scientists will conduct research on how hilsa can be grown in ponds.

208,"Lahaul ditches potato, goes for apple, vegetable farming",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/Lahaul-ditches-potato-goes-for-apple-vegetable-farming/articleshow/22565518.cms,2013-09-14,The Times Of India,"SHIMLA: In the wake of higher input costs and declining returns, the Lahaul valley, where seed potatoes are grown since 1965, is witnessing a quite shift from the traditional potato cultivation. While the area under potato cultivation is slowly shrinking, cultivation of apple, peas, seabuckthorn and offseason vegetables has witnessed considerable expansion over the years.Inhabited by a population of over 31,000 people, farming remains the main profession of people in the valley. Growing potato in the traditional way since 1854, people switched over to commercial farming in 1965, thanks to efforts by then deputy commissioner K S Bains, who introduced the ""upto-date'' variety of potato, sources said.By sheer hard work, the tribals had then created a record of 46,979 kg per hectare production which was higher than in countries like Netherlands (37,772 kg), England (31,789 kg), Germany (30,948 kg), USA (30,322 kg), France (27,255 kg), Japan (26,154 kg), etc. About 1,200 hectares of land was under potato cultivation then. This motivated the locals to set up a cooperative society called ""Lahaul Potato Growers Cooperative Society"" (LPS) on May 28, 1966. Potato production had once made LPS the second largest cooperative society in India, after Amul, they said.However, the tribals are now slowly deviating from potato production, which had turned their fortunes, despite increased demand from states like Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and other areas, as the crop requires more time and labour, while returns are relatively low, sources said. Seed potato is currently grown only in 747 hectares while peas has gained the status of major cash crop with its cultivation being done in 1,782 hectares, with 202 hectares area under fruit cultivation.Balbir Singh Yarki, a resident of Tinan valley, said that farmers in Lahaul are now expecting good returns from cultivation of apple, seabuckthorn and vegetables. ""Potato production has seen a decline as people have now turned to production of green peas, vegetables, seabuckthron and apple,"" he added.Premjeet of Phura village in Pattan valley said that in his village, instead of potato, people are now interested in growing apple and offseason vegetables. ""Many residents earn handsome income by sending exotic vegetables to markets in Delhi and elsewhere. Who would then grow potato, which needs more labour while the returns are relatively low,"" he said.""The entire valley is witnessing an increase in apple orchards and fields growing exotic vegetables. Each year, hundreds of trees are planted and more areas are brought under vegetable cultivation, resulting in decline in potato production,"" said Dileep Singh, a farmer from Chimrat village of Miyar valley.LPS managing director Amar Dogra said that potato production in Lahaul is decreasing by 5% to 10% annually as people are diversifying into fruit and vegetable production. ""Last year, the total production was 2.5 lakh bags and the farmers got only about Rs 1,300 per quintal. As such, they are now eying production of apple and vegetables,"" he said."

The farmers still put their bet on HD 2697 and PBW 621 which were also the bestsellers in the September Kisan Mela last year.The seed HD 2697,which was introduced last year,recorded the maximum sale in 2012 and was followed by PBW 621. Last year,the varsity sold seeds of Rs 1.03 crore which was less than the sale of Rs 1.20 crore in 2011.However,this year the varsity refused to reveal the sale figures of its seeds. Sources said the latest variety PBW 658 which is a late sowing variety and was available to farmers for Rs 500 per 10 kg on Friday failed to impress the farmers.This year too we sold maximum of HD 2697 and PBW 621. The latest variety was a late sowing variety which is popular with farmers who get fields vacated late due to potato and cotton farming, said a source from PAU seeds department.Farmers were also disappointed at the fact that PAU was not able to provide them seeds in the required quantity. I was standing in the queue since morning for seeds but when my turn came,the seeds were sold out, said Gurnam Singh who came from Tarn Taran to purchase seeds.However,farmers said that while rates offered by PAU and private shops and stalls outside were almost the same,it was the pure quality of PAU seeds which made them buy seeds from here. Outside also,both varieties are available for Rs 960 per 40 kg but we know that PAU seeds will be pure whereas private companies do adulteration, said Ranbir Singh from Moga.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

On the concluding day of the Congress, UP's minister for Agriculture and Food Processing, Anand Singh supported GM crop production and sought directions from chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who is said to be still weighing his options.The CM was the chief guest at the sixth edition of the congress which was hosted in Uttar Pradesh for the first time. ""Samajwadi Party is ensuring that farmers receive good quality seeds, fertilizers and irrigation facilities to increase their production. Government is giving priority to soil testing so that the production capacity of the farmland may increase"", said Yadav.The minister emphasised on the need of good research work to prevent crops from diseases and disseminating useful information on agriculture to the farmers. Making a passing reference to the new agriculture technologies including GM crops, he said that the recent researches and technologies can only be accepted by farmers when they start believing it and its benefits to their crops.Anand Singh said UP is a leading producer of wheat, potatoes and sugarcane but the state still needs to improve in production of oilseeds and lentils. He said almost 10% of the agricultural produce gets damaged due to poor storage facilities in UP. ""While we lead pre-harvest stage of production, we need to better our post-harvest facilities in order to match global standards.""UP Seed Development Corporation, one of the organizers of the event assured that it is working towards development of good quality seeds which is a priority for the state government.In UP, agriculture constitutes 25% of the GDP and gives livelihood to almost 68% people.Agriculture Production Commissioner, UP, Alok Ranjan said the agriculture growth rate has been targeted at 5.1% in the 12th five year plan, hence all possible efforts are being made to provide high quality seeds to farmers. He said the government has prepared a seed rolling plan for wheat cultivation in the state in which development of new variety of seeds will be encouraged. In this plan, breed which is less than 10 years old will be promoted while breed which is older than 15 years of age would be phased out.Atanu Purkayastha, joint secretary, ministry of agriculture made concluding remarks in the event that the state needs to strengthen it seed certification and seed-law machinery. Also, well-trained staff and testing labs on global standards are required to develop high yielding variety of crops, he added."

During her address,Dr Chan,the chief guest at the ceremony,referred AIIMS as the All India Institute of Medical Services. Immediately,the Health Minister corrected her,pointing out that the S in AIIMS stood for Sciences. But,Dr Chan said,Yes,I know I was just checking if you were awake. She went on to say how Azad,despite being down with a cold,had been attending all the meetings at the ongoing SEARO regions health ministers meet in Delhi. I wanted to see if the medicines were making you sleepy, she said.Media madnessDuring arguments for the the sentencing for the four accused in the December 16 gangrape case,scores of reporters waited outside the court room. Any lawyer or policeman who was spotted even briefly would be followed by reporters trying to get at least a brief insight into the court proceedings. During one such day,the reporters spotted defence lawyer V K Anand outside the court. Anand was trying to make a run for the lift to avoid the media. But the reporters chased him,trying to get him to speak. So earnest was this chase that the lawyer ended up being followed till the washroom. Finally,he had to request them to at least let me use the toilet in peace.Switching sidesThere was a time when Delhi BJP chief Vijay Goel,considered close to L K Advani,had opposed a proposal to nominate Narendra Modi as the partys chief of election campaign. However,after the Gujarat chief minister was named the Prime Ministerial candidate for the 2014 general elections,Goel was found rather keen to congratulate Modi. In fact,the state unit sent out a release stating that Modi has a pan-India appeal and that the party had found direction under of Modis leadership.Law of errorsSpeedy justice may not always go hand-in-hand with accuracy. And this was witnessed during the pronouncement of the verdict in the December 16 gangrape case last week. Under pressure from mediapersons to quickly finish typing the verdict,the court staff ended up making several printing errors on the document. Even the version of the order uploaded online contained those errors. In one such error,the date of arrest of the accused in the December 16 incident was recorded as November 2012.Quick stop,shopWith onion prices soaring,many have resorted to making a vegetable shopping stop at the Delhi Secretariat. A stall has been set up in the parking area opposite the Secretariat,which sells onions and potatoes on a no-profit,no-loss basis. So many people,right from journalists to a casual visitors to the Secretariat,have been found picking up their vegetables before heading out to work.New culpritDuring elections,it is common practice for candidates to blame each other for rigging the polling process.

It is important that structural factors affecting food inflation are addressed on a priority basis, A.

The latest inflation data is going to weigh high on Dr. Rajans mind when he announces the mid-quarter monetary policy on September 20. The industry has been demanding a cut in key policy rate to spur economic growth.Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) Chairman C. Rangarajan said inflation, besides forex market, was expected to weigh on the RBIs decision on its policy.All that I can say is that the RBI, I believe, will take into account the behaviour of inflation as well as what is happening in the foreign exchange market and take a decision, he said on the sidelines of an Assocham-organised event here.Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said: The rise in inflation should not come in the way of the policy of forthcoming monetary policy on September 20, as it is of utmost importance to revive investor sentiment.The key concern for a long time now is that rise in food prices continues to contribute strongly to overall inflation. It is, therefore, important that structural factors affecting food inflation are addressed on a priority basis, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Secretary-General Didar Singh said.The high increase in prices was also seen in other essential food items such as rice, cereals, egg, meat and fishThe jump in food prices has undermined the overall performance of WPI inflation which could have been below 5 per cent if food prices had not escalated. Government should focus on easing supply chain bottlenecks and make provisions for consumers to buy directly from farmers, President of PHD Chamber of Commerce Suman Jyoti Khaitan said.The food items became costlier by 18.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis.This (inflation) would further affect the prospects of economic growth revival and the corporate sector will continue to bear the brunt of higher growth in input prices, Assocham Secretary-General D. S. Rawat said.The Reserve Bank must ensure that the cost of finance to the end-user becomes competitive without any further delay. The upcoming mid-quarter monetary policy review must not resort to interest rate tightening, as that would further push the prices up, Mr. Rawat said.While keeping inflation under check has to be a priority, it is imperative that we continue efforts to rekindle investor sentiment and push for higher growth, Mr. Singh said.

With the State witnessing heavy rainfall, it has not only damaged crops but also adversely affected the transporation, putting it totally out of gear.For, according to traders, not many transporters are ready to ferry the perishable produce from farms due to inclement weather which take a heavy toll on their transport vehicles.Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) Merchants Association president Shankarappa said onions were being supplied from Hosadurga and Chitradurga districts.But with the two districts experiencing heavy rains, transportation of onions have virtually ceased. Likewise, another attributed poor supplies from Maharashtra, also due to heavy rains, as contributing to skyrocketing onion prices.The situation is expected to remain the same for the entire month until the new onion crop arrives in the market."

However, once the stock of the local harvest is exhausted, the prices will shoot up.""The wholesale price of lady finger isRs 25 per kg while Rs 35 per kg in retail.

Traders say that a shortage of the crop is likely to raise the price of onions even more in the coming days which may spell some concern for the government with elections just a couple of months away. By Tuesday, the price had already touched Rs 80 per kg in many parts of the city and a drop is expected only around October.Simultaneously, even though the wholesale rates of most other vegetables have been stable this month, their retail prices have shot up. Vendors say that with the festival season around the corner, they might go further up. ""Experience has shown that most vegetable prices will rise next month before falling around November-end. They will remain low till February. At present, most vegetables are above Rs 40 per kg,"" said Sanjay, a vendor in Patparganj.The wholesale price of onions in the city has risen by almost Rs 20 since the beginning of September. Heavy rain in south and west India has seen a fall in onion supply. ""Heavy rain is being recorded in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, the three states which supply onions to Delhi at this time. Once the rain stops, we will see a fall in prices,"" said Rajendra Sharma, chairman, Delhi Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee.Sources say that the brief fall in onion prices last month was largely a result of the government trying to gain some political mileage. ""Even earlier, when heavy rain had resulted in reduced supply, traders were releasing stored crop slowly. After criticism, when onion touched Rs 80 per kg, the government started raiding these godowns and briefly increased supply. Now, this supply is also nearing an end and hence prices have shot up again,"" said a source.Surendra Sahni, owner of Gujarat Onions Co, said a fall in prices could not be expected till the middle of October. ""Storage crop is almost ending and new crop is not coming in as fast as we need. Even once rain stops, the price recovery will not be immediate. Delhi will also get some new crop from Alwar after October 15,"" he said.Meanwhile, Delhiiites have to shell out more for not just onions but for almost all vegetables. ""Spending Rs 600 or so for vegetables every two to three days is not uncommon any longer. At present, not too much variety in vegetables is available and the cheapest is potato which is about Rs 20 per kg. Why does the government have to wait for a public outcry before it takes action against illegal hoarding and indiscriminate price hike,"" said Prabha Verma, a resident of Mukherjee Nagar."

Our vegetable suppliers have been with us for decades and there has been no change in supply due to the price hike. Neither have we reduced the use of onions in the restaurant.""""The Lalit Ashok is a food and beverage-centric hotel and we definitely won't compromise on quality. Our food prices remain the same as we believe the onion price rise is transitory,"" said Amit Samson, general manager, Lalit Ashok.But the not-so-big players are tweaking their recipes.""There are certain North Indian gravies where we cannot reduce onion usage because that changes their taste completely. But there are some dishes in which we can cut down on onions, like onion dosa or utthappam, or the potato filling in masala dosa. Many hotels are now using 25% onions and 75% potato mash for dosa filling. Even in chaats, the use of onions can be reduced,"" explained K Ramamurthy, secretary, Bruhat Bangalore Hotels' Association (BBHA).""The hotel industry is hit first when it comes to price rise. If prices go up, people cut down on eating out. Bachelors have no choice but to eat in small hotels,"" he added.But smaller hotels and chains which have been opening outlets across the city admit they've been hit hard. ""Smaller hotels have no choice but to tweak the taste of food by reducing onion use, or stop making dishes where onions are a must. Those who planned to open new outlets are waiting until the market stabilizes,"" Ramamurthy added.While big hotels and restaurants will ride out the highs, small hotels could perish if this continues. There are about 1,500 small, big and medium hotels in the city under the BBHA banner, he added."

""It has virtually disappeared from the plates of poor and middle class people,"" says Mita Sharat, a housewife in Purnia.It is not only the price of onion which has sky-rocketed, prices of vegetables of all kinds have soared sky high. Parwal (pointed gourd) too has gone beyond Rs 35 per kg while bitter gourd sells at Rs 40. Even raddish and lady's finger pinch pocket and sells at Rs 35 to Rs 40 per kg.""There is absolutely no market mechanism and any kind of administrative control on the prices,"" tells Renu Gami in Katihar. ""How many things you give a miss,"" quips a college lecturer Meena Kumari in Kishanganj. Only potatoes are cheap and sells at Rs 10 per kg.Milk, which was selling at Rs 30 per kg a few months ago, is available at Rs 35 per kg now. Along with vegetables, simple fruits like apple now sells at Rs 60 to Rs 70 per kg in the markets across Purnia division. ""Every morning, before we arrange our vend at the vegetable mart, we get in touch with our suppliers at different places like Delhi and Siliguri (West bengal), and then decide on the prices of vegetables in the local market,"" candidly admits vegetable seller Mohammad Kalam at Kishanganj.As the festive season knocks at the door, vegetables will be the mainstay of daily diet.Many will only be skipping non-vegetarian dishes like mutton and chicken. Mutton prices are hovering at Rs 340 to Rs 400 per kg, chicken too is pocket pincher at Rs 220 or more per kg. Fishes rule at anything between Rs 180 to Rs 400 per kg depending on its delicacy.""The household expenses have made a quantum jump and prices of all items of daily use only get on our nerves,"" tells a retired school teacher Siyawar Singh.""

Bangalore is taking the pricey vegetable in its stride, as Wednesday's rate touched Rs 76 per kg at Horticultural Producers' Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (Hopcoms) stalls across Bangalore. Onions were tagged at Rs 80-82 at the greengrocer's , while wholesale price of medium and large-sized varieties stood at Rs 60 per kg.Excessive rainfall is behind the price spiral. Stocks from Nashik in Maharashtra and Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh have dried up, as standing crops have been ravaged by rain. So has the arrival of the produce from various places in Karnataka. Besides rain, rising transportation costs, fuel price hike, 6% commission to farmers and 1% to APMC are the other contributing factors.""More than half the crop stands damaged in Maharashtra. This state supplies onions to the entire country. There's a shortage after November every year, but this year, it happened two months earlier,"" said S Balakrishna, Potato and Onion Merchants' Association in Bangalore.Authorities have thrown up their hands, leaving the consumer exposed to the vagaries of the market . ""Karnataka depends on other states for onions from March to September. Nashik growers release stocks in phases. This price spiral is expected to remain so in the state for the next couple of days,"" MK Shankaralinge Gowda, principal secretary, horticulture department, told TOI.They're hoping the situation will ease as onions cultivated in north interior parts of the state will begin catering to local demand later this month. But sources in Hubli agricultural produce market yards point out that heavy rain has damaged crops in parts of Bagalkot, Bijapur, Dharwad, Chitradurga and Belgaum districts. Besides, farmers in these areas have shifted to other crops on a large scale, after they failed to get adequate minimum support price during a glut in yield in 2010-11 .The cruel irony of it all is that Karnataka is the second largest onion producer in the country, accounting for 17% of the production . The state's onions are exported to several parts of the country , like New Delhi, Chennai and even Mumbai. But Karnataka's homegrown onions, that are smaller in size and cost less, are not much in demand. ""Hotels and bars require old and big onions because they have less water content. If you fry small onions, the water is released into the oil, which turns black. This increases oil consumption and gives food an unpleasant look,"" Balakrishna said.Onion prices are north-bound elsewhere in the state too. In Mangalore , they cost Rs 61 per kg at Hopcoms outlets, up from last week'sRs 41. In Mysore, onions are costlier than apple and pomegranate, hovering around Rs 70 per kg, as against Rs 60 per kg for apple and Rs 70 for pomegranate . In Hubli, onion prices hovered between Rs 60 and Rs 70 in retail markets. The authorities admit the situation is also the result of poor post-harvest storage facilities in the state. There are only 346 storage units which can hold about 185 tonnes of the 2.50 lakh tonnes of onion produced every year.The state government, during a discussion on onion price rise in New Delhi, suggested that the Centre start an 'Onion Mission' on the lines of the 'horticulture mission' .DL Maheshwar, additional director of horticulture, said development of an integrated module with varieties and production, protection , post-harvest handling for the kharif season in different agroecological zones, minimization of post-harvest losses, supply chain management-production , storageregulated supply to the market, market intelligence and change in crop pattern and also varietal replacement would immensely help control the price rise."

The summit ended on Wednesday.He further said the government and the private sector should join hands in preventing wastage of food at different stages - harvesting, milling and distribution. The summit, which was organized by the union ministry for agriculture, governments of West Bengal and Bihar, Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) and Indian Chamber of Commerce, prepared plans for crop diversification and involvement of industries in food production.Commission for agriculture cost and prices chairman Ashok Gulati forecast the second Green Revolution would come from Bihar. Gulati, who visited different districts, including Rohtas, Buxar, Bhojpur and Patna district, said the farmers are selling their paddy for Rs 950 per quintal against the minimum support price of Rs 1,250. The rice from Bihar goes to Punjab on rakes for milling and then returned to FCI godowns, he said.Bihar agriculture secretary Vivek Kumar Singh asked the industries to invest in agriculture tools industry in the state where annual demand was worth Rs 4,000 crore and local farmers had to buy tractors and other tools from Punjab and Haryana.

Even frozen food marketers such as McCain Foods now identify French fries as their top-selling product in the country.""Potatoes are a quintessential part of the Indian eating habit, which is where French fries fit in... they are easily sharable and dippable in ketchup or other condiments, which is inherently how we snack,"" says Tarun Lal, KFC's general manager for India and surrounding countries.Lal says almost half of the burger meals sold at KFC include a serving of fries. ""The next step in our fries journey is to launch flavours and sauces which are available internationally,"" he adds. Burger-and-fries chain McDonald's reports a 30% year-on-year increase in fries sales, which is amongst the highest on its menu, a McDonald's India (North and East) spokesperson says.French fries, sold in little paper sacks in McDonald's and KFC, has been popular in the West for centuries and is estimated to account for more than one-fourth of all potatoes sold in the US, but in India it's a relatively new concept made popular after the entry of American fast-food chains.Devendra Chawla, president (Food Bazaar) at Future Group, says French fries has emerged as the new-age avatar of 'pakoda' in convenience food category, much like chocolates are replacing ladoos in gifts. ""French fries due to its popularity is leading to a reverse category creation, entering Indian homes from fast-food joints since it's easy to cook. It is also emerging as an alternative to current serious snacking for kids at home, replacing chips and noodles,"" Chawla says.Retailers say sales of frozen French fries of brands such as McCain, Sumeru and Al Kabeer are growing anywhere between 30%-40% in their chains. Mohit Kampani, president & CEO at Spencer's Retail, says French fries now account for almost 70% of the retailer's potato-based frozen snack sales.Canadian firm McCain Foods, the world's largest maker of French fries and assorted potato snacks, says fries along with potato smiles are its fastest moving products in India. ""A new snacking category is being created and is accelerating,"" Vikas Mittal, MD of McCain Foods India, says. ""Food that cooks fast and doesn't compromise on taste has played a huge role in driving the category."" He says growth of products such as fries in India is being driven by factors such as consumer awareness, taste and freshness, and higher freezer penetration at retail stores.The frozen snack food market is estimated at Rs 800 crore, which includes both vegetarian and non-vegetarian snacks, growing upwards of 15-20%. Arabind Das, COO at Godrej Tyson Foods, says changing lifestyles and rising incomes are making more and more consumers seek the convenience of stocking frozen snacks."

We won't gain any profit out of hoarding. I don't know of traders they may or may not be doing it but the farmers are surely behind present crisis.

224,Food prices rose 157% between 2004 and 2013,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Food-prices-rose-157-between-2004-and-2013/articleshow/22777817.cms,2013-09-20,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: If you were to ask any random aam aadmi anywhere in India what is the single biggest failing of the UPA, the answer would be - price rise. This is so because the most important items of family spending - food items - have relentlessly risen for the past several years despite repeated promises to bring them down by the economic mandarins and policy wonks that run the country's economy. Poorer families have had to stop eating various foods in order to save crumbling family budgets.Between 2004 and 2013 food prices in general rose by 157%. But when you get into the nuts and bolts the real pain becomes starkly clear. India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world. Yet chronic supply shortages coupled with serial hoarding has led vegetable prices to shoot up by a deadly 350% in that period.Onion prices have increased by an incredible 521% since 2004. And it's not a smooth even rise. There were times when onion prices doubled, even tripled within weeks and then subsided after a few weeks of rampage. This happened in the winter of 2010-11. And it is happening again now with onion prices touching Rs 70-80 levels in most parts of the country.This has happened with other key staples also like potatoes. In the second half of 2009 potato prices zoomed up by almost 100% and it was only in January 2010 that the levels came down. Other vegetables have followed their own mad ways - brinjal for instance is 311% costlier now than in 2004, and prices of the lowly cabbage have risen by a jaw dropping 714%. Various vegetable prices are in fact at all time highs.The hike in vegetable prices hit poorer families especially hard because earlier, starting 2006, another staple of families had been knocked out of thalis. This was pulses, the single biggest source of protein in largely vegetarian India. Their prices rose steadily 2005 onwards and by 2010 they had more than doubled. Then again they increased in 2012 and reached an all time high in September last year. There has been a slight decline since then but even then prices are 123% higher than 2004.What about other key food items? Milk prices have increased by 119%. Egg prices have gone up by 124%. Spices and condiments have increased by 119%. Sugar has increased by 106%. Even salt, an essential of most cooked food has increased by 85% in the past decade.Prices of the two staple cereals of India, rice and wheat, have increased by 137% and 117%, respectively. Remember, India has seen record harvests for a series of years and except for 2004 and 2009, monsoons have been good generally. So mass produced crops like wheat and rice which demand high water inputs have not been subject to the usual weather depression. Even fruit prices have increased by 95% despite bumper crops of many popular fruits like bananas, mangoes, oranges and papaya.These are the wholesale prices. What the aam aadmi gets at the local shop has more jacked up prices. But if the wholesale prices have risen so dramatically, imagine the real prices you pay for.Strangely, principal political parties gearing up for elections next year seem to be indifferent to this continuing decimation of family budgets. It will be a very angry voter that they will face at the hustings."
225,"Investors, It's Time to Go Vegan",https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/investors-it-s-time-to-go-vegan/story-0DY1mwWlnoAp9Pe6a6qezN.html,2013-09-22,Hindustan Times,"Dear investors,Where should you invest your hard-earned money? We at Vegetarian Investments Ltd have the answer to your plaintive question. Why vegetarian, you ask? It is to ensure that while we respect your dietary sensibilities, we also earn outsize returns on them.Do vegetarian investments make sense? Well, lets consider non-vegetarian investments, however painful that may be. Take, for example, pork. Pork prices, according to the wholesale price index, were up a mere 4.8% in August, compared to a year ago. That is a good thing, for those who like pork vindaloo. But its a lousy return for those who invest in pork, apart from the meat going bad anyway.Contrast the joys of vegetarian investing. Consider ginger. Wholesale dry ginger prices have gone up 38.9%. That is what you would have earned if you had invested in (the technical term is hoarded) ginger for the past one year. Even after cold storage costs, its a decent return. Or take tapioca. Tapioca wholesale prices are up a mouth-watering 116.2%. And green peas are such a top secret investment the government has stopped publishing its wholesale prices.Investor surveys show many decent vegetarian folk put their money in bank fixed deposits, earning a piffling 9% per year or so. Some put it in shares, where the returns are linked to the state of the Indian economy. We all know how badly the economy is doing. And the uncomfortable truth is nobody knows whether fixed deposits or stocks are vegetarian.On the other hand, investing in cereals and vegetables is profitable even when the economy is comatose. People have a tendency to eat, so demand remains strong, while we adjust the supply. Our economist tells us India has a competitive advantage in hoarding. That is why the humble ragi has returned 41.5% in a year. And our star investment, the onion, has given us a massive 244.6%. That is how much wholesale onion prices have risen in the past year.Last year, when we launched our Onion Fund, the heading of our research report was Sell Gold, Buy Onions. Those who listened to us have not only made huge profits, but they have also been patriotic, because while you have to import gold, onions are grown in our green and pleasant land. Thats apart from being able to deck your daughter out in the choicest onion garlands for her wedding. Best of all, you could eat some of them, without paying through your nose.You may ask why you should not invest in vegetables yourself, rather than entrust your funds to us. Well, we are expert professional hoarders, with a hoary history of hoarding. For instance, you may have decided to buy potatoes with onions because they go together.But potato prices have fallen. We, on the other hand, who can truly bring you the benefits of diversification, bought garlic, whose prices have gone up 39.7% in the past year. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, we invite you to invest in our Onion Fund. By far the best way would be to put in a small amount every month  we call it the Systematic Onion Plan (SOP).Lastly, the key to good fund management is a great fund manager. We intend to ask a maestro of agricultural investing to manage our Onion and Vegan Funds.

Incidentally, Tahrir means liberation, and that is what the thousands of people who had gathered here were demanding.The Egyptians and all those people who were in the country in the days leading up to the revolution speak of how one could just smell the revolution in the air. The people rose against the increasingly autocratic rule of Hosni Mubarak, who had held the reins of Egypt since 1981. Their voice reverberated on the social media, on TV channels and in newspapers across the world. Some Egyptians speak poetically of how even the grey walls of Cairo came alive with bursts of colour. They are, of course, referring to the graffiti which would magically appear on walls.The walls of Egypt are still peppered with graffiti even today. I am beginning my journey to discover their story from where the revolution started  near Tahrir, at the Mohamed Mahmoud Street.The Mohamed Mahmoud Street  one of Cairos main arteries leading from the Interior Ministry into Tahrir Square  has been witness to all the turbulence that Egypt has seen since the beginning of the Arab Spring in the last month of 2010. In November 2011, protests took place in this area in reaction to the Egyptian police and Central Security Forcess brutal attack on peaceful protesters. Many lost their lives during the clashes.The graffiti artists I have spoken to tell me how they would camp at Mohamed Mahmoud Street, sheltered by the nights darkness, to make art with a purpose. Their work is everywhere  on the walls of the American University in Cairo, on the buildings and schools surrounding it, and on the concrete wall that was built later to stop protesters from advancing to the Ministry of Interior building. The themes are political, and understandably so, given the charged atmosphere of the country.Described as an open art gallery by some, the graffiti here chronicles the issues that led to the revolution, and satires the political class, right from Mubarak to former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, who was recently removed in a military-backed coup in July. It is also a tribute to those who have died for the country, even as its struggle for liberation continues.A tribute to photojournalist Al-Husseini Abu Deif, who was shot in the head while covering protests outside the presidential palace in December 2011. He succumbed to his injuries a week later. His last tweet reads if i die tonight, I ask you only to continue the revolution. The forensic report concluded that the cause of death was a shot in the head, resulting in bleeding in the brain and skull lacerations, in addition to injuries and abrasions on the body. He is one of the first journalists to have been shot dead at the onset of the revolution.This graffiti is a tribute to Alaa Abd El-Hady, a fifth year medical student from Cairos Ain Shams University. El-Hady was murdered on Friday 16th December 2011 by security forces belonging to Egypts then ruling military junta, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, during their attack on a sit-in at the Egyptian Cabinet Office.This graffiti shows Mina Daniel and Sheikh Emad Effat, both in galabeyas (traditional Egyptian dress), with their hands spread out over the faces of many other martyrs.Mina was dubbed Egypts Che Guevara after the Cuban revolutionary Mina admired and emulated. He was known to for fostering good relations between Christians and Muslims. In Minas last televised interview, he was asked why he joined the protests that started on January 25, 2011 although the Coptic Church forbade Christians from taking part in the uprising. Mina said the church was a spiritual institution, not a political one. He said that he joined the protests because he wanted an end to the high unemployment rates in Egypt, better education, social justice and a healthy, more inclusive political system.The 25-year-old was killed on February 2, 2011, when pro-government thugs attacked unarmed protesters in Tahrir Square, leaving dozens killed and hundreds injured. While in the ambulance, after sustaining fatal injuries, Daniels last words to his friends were: If I die, I want my funeral to be in Tahrir Square. And, so it was.Sheikh Emad Effat, who was killed at the age of 52 in 2011 by military police with a gunshot to his heart, was a revolutionary Islamic scholar and taught at Al-Azhar Mosque and Dar al-Iftaa, the Muslim worlds premier institution for legal research.Effat was killed in Tahrir Square when military police cracked down on a sit-in by the cabinet building. His family and students suspect that he may have been targeted because of his criticism of the ruling military council and, most importantly, due to his last fatwa, which forbade voting for parliamentary candidates with links to Mubaraks regime and former members of the dissolved National Democratic Party.The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) is the governing body of 21 senior officers in the Egyptian military. The council is held only in case of war or great insurgencies. After the January 25 Revolution the SCAF took the power to govern Egypt from its ousted President Hosni Mubarak on 11 February 2011, and relinquished power on 30 June 2012 upon the start of Mohamed Morsis term as President.The SCAF came under heavy criticism for the highhanded manner in which it dealt with demonstrations and demonstrators. One particular incident shows the dark side of the SCAF. On October 2011 armed soldiers attacked peaceful protestors leaving over 20 dead.The SCAF initially denied the army was responsible for any violence and further claimed that three soldiers had been killed by protestors, claiming that the soldiers were not carrying any live ammunition. Later, video evidence was broadcast showing army vehicles hitting groups of protestors.A tribute to the matyrs who died during protests at Mohamed Mahmoud StreetA tribute to Omar Salah, a 10-year-old street vendor, who was killed by security forces on February 3, 2011 outside the US Embassy in Cairo. He was killed while selling potatoes near a security checkpoint near the embassy instead of his usual spot at Tahrir. An army spokesman apologized later for the killing insisting it was an accident.The Interior Ministry has not changed reads the graffiti on the burnt walls a school in the street. The Ministry of Interior directs the Central Security Forces, the Border Guard Forces, the National Police and the Egyptian Homeland security in Egypt.Graffiti of the Guy Fawkes mask on a shops shutter at the street. Since the release in 2006 of the film V for Vendetta, the use of stylised Guy Fawkes masks, with moustache and pointed beard, has become widespread internationally among groups protesting against politicians, banks and financial institutions. The masks both conceal the identity of individuals and demonstrate their commitment to a shared cause. It is used widely by protesters in Egypt.A tribute to Mohamad Cristy Hussein who was shot dead on June 25, 2012. Cristy was also an admin of the Facebook page Lying Brothers, an anti-Muslim Brotherhood page. The graffiti read, They will say Cristy died/tell them no he lives/ There is no death in heaven/ and unearned entrance.A mural of different men with different beards, but the same brain. The artist is probably hinting that outwards appearances dont matter till the time the outlook a person doesnt change. In fact, it almost looks like the evolution progression from ape to man or vice versaThis graffiti shows Islamist President Mohamed Morsi sitting on the lap of the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Badie. The graffiti is a satire on how Morsi was a puppet with no independent voice.This graffiti shows a protester standing his ground in front of the Muslim Brotherhood goon who is trying dominate over him. This graffiti was made in the days leading up to the uprising which resulted in the ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi on July 3.A satire on how supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood have a herd mentality. They follow whatever their leaders tell them much like sheep follow their master without any questions.Even the birds in Cairo need to wear face masks to protect themselves from tear gas.The top banner of this graffiti reads We will implement the Sharia law even if we break it! It hints at religious hypocrisy and suggests that extremist who want to implement the Sharia dont follow the divine teaching of the Prophet. It hints at how some people are trying to clamp down on freedom and rights of others in the name of religion.You Are Liars reads a graffiti depicting religious extremists and members of the ousted Presidents party the Muslim Brotherhood. These groups are shown trying to censor street art and the voice of the people.The graffiti shows Morsi as a diabolical superman and probably hints at the fact that he portrays one image in public, but is rotten from inside. Here Super Morsi is shown and the logo of the Muslim Brotherhood is tweaked and reads  If it (positive development) happens, he will deny it.You Are Liars reads a graffiti against religious extremists and the Muslim Brotherhoods attempts to censor street art."
227,Surat: Vegetable prices skyrocket,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/Surat-Vegetable-prices-skyrocket/articleshow/22965400.cms,2013-09-24,The Times Of India,"SURAT: Vegetable vendors, grocers and milk vendors made merry even as hapless residents were running helter-skelter to buy essential commodities fearing flood possibility.Cash registers of many of them started ringing as scared Surtis rushed out of their houses to buy milk and vegetables.No vegetable was sold at less than Rs 50 a kg on Monday morning. Potato was sold at Rs 50 a kg and so was the tomato. Onions were not available and the rates of other green vegetables were exorbitant ranging between Rs 80 and Rs 150 per kg.A 500 mg milk packet was being sold double its price as many residents demanded extra packets from the vendors. The vendors took advantage of the panicky situation.""Many retail vendors were seen selling a commodity like poha at Rs 100 per kg while it is available at Rs 40-Rs 50 per kg on normal days,"" said Kamal Patel, a resident of Palanpur Patia."
228,Greek quotient,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/greek-quotient/,2013-09-24,Indian Express,"It wasnt easy to picture AD Singhs Olive Bar & Kitchen in Mahalaxmi being replaced by another restaurant. But its white walls complemented with blue,perhaps make for the perfect setting for Thalassa Pop Up in Mumbai. Although the local eaterys mood may not match up to that of the popular Greek restaurant by the Vagator beach in Goa,Mariketty Granas food fits right in with Olives Mediterranean theme. To make the space her own  Grana has set up shop here until April 2014  she has transformed it into a Greek taverna with the help of ornate mirrors and ceramic plates.The night began slow but picked up pace as food started to arrive on the table and conversations became more animated. First up was Tiro-kaf-teri (Rs 480)  a spicy dip made of feta and olive oil,which was served with mildly-herbed warm pita bread. The feta was the undisputed hero of the night,making its presence felt in dishes across the menu,which included salads,soups,rolls and a variety of mains. However,an absolute favourite on the table was the very addictive Tzatziki dip(Rs 200),a combination of yoghurt,cucumber,olive oil,garlic and a very refreshing smattering of dill served with fresh pita.Next came the very popular Greek snack,Pita souvlaki wraps (Rs 410) and according to Grana,every Greek eats at least one everyday. The succulent pieces of lamb were cooked in its own juices to retain the authentic flavour and were wrapped with sauces in neatly folded bread. The wrap came with crispy potato wedges,which was average. It took a generous helping of our favourite tzatziki to polish it off.Another highlight of the meal at Thalassa was the traditional lamb preparation called Kleftiko. Tender pieces of fillet lamb,cooked in a sealed clay pot for over three hours,was served with vegetables such as potatoes,carrots and oodles of cheese,both cheddar and feta. Each bite instantly melted in the mouth. The pot used to make Kleftiko (Rs 560) is sealed with light pastry,which puffs up in the oven,adding ample amount of drama and some crunch to the dish.No Greek meal is complete without the Mediterranean dessert  Baklava  made with phyllo dough (paper-thin sheets of unleavened dough),nuts,butter,and sugar. Ours came with a lot of pistachio but very little pastry. For those looking for something light,Galaktoboureko,a semolina-based creamy custard pie made of phyllo dough and glazed with sugar syrup,is an option. However,we suggest sticking to the tiramisu although its not traditionally a Greek dessert. The taste of the rich mascarpone cheese infused with coffee atop Italian biscottis was better than the Greek dessert varieties.Meal for two at Thalassa Pop Up would cost aboutRs 2,500 (without alcohol).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Vegetable 'kolu' are much sought after this season as Navaratri approaches.While vegetable models made of wax and plastic have been in the 'kolu' market for many years, what's catching the Navaratri enthusiast's eyes this time are vegetables and fruits made of terracotta. They are available on roadsides in Mylapore and shops like Poompuhar. At Poompuhar, they cost 10 a piece.These terracotta vegetables have become a hit mainly due to the 'real' look which is a result of some intricate craftsmanship. The seeds inside a bean, the lines outside a banana and the light green tinge of a lemon are all replicated in detail, making it ""so cute not to feel - and buy - them,"" as K Aparna of Mylapore puts it.""The plastic ones are fine, but they don't look half as good as the terracotta ones,"" said Bhama, who bought quite a few terracotta tomatoes, potatoes and beans for 'kolu'' this time. ""According to the custom, every year one has to add a new item to the Navaratri kolu, even if you have enough at home from last year.""Artisans from Kolkata have come here to sell the products. For S Roy, 62, at Poompuhar, who's selling miniature terracotta vegetables, the demand has been huge. With people buying till the last day of the season, artisans have fanned out across the city. Poompuhar store manager Bose R said demand for these products has been high for the last couple of years. Navaratri starts on October 5, and Tamil homes set up 'kolu,' the arrangement of dolls and other artifacts in their homes the previous day."
230,Conman who brought disgrace to Nalanda still at large,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/360160/conman-brought-disgrace-nalanda-still.html,2013-09-29,Deccan Herald,"Conman who brought disgrace to Nalanda still at largeAbhay Kumar, Patna, Sep 29, 2013, DHNS: 0:50 ISTAlmost a week after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) busted a racket which helped more than 50 people from Bihar become probationary officers in different banks, the leader of the racket Sanjiv Verma, a peon, remains out of the police dragnet.Posted at Bihar Education Resource Centre (BERC) in Nalanda, the peon led a high-level gang, which included POs as impersonators who helped unemployed youth clear examinations for a fee. The rate was Rs 18 lakh for PO and Rs 10 lakh for a bank clerk.But Sanjiv is not the first conman from Nalanda, who fleeced young aspirants.It was Ranjit Singh, alias Ranjit Don, from Hilsa in Nalanda, who ran a well-oiled racket in leaking question papers and facilitating admissions into premier medical and engineering colleges by placing dummy candidates. Ranjit was arrested in 2003 for leaking the question papers for Common Admission Test (CAT).His clients included wards of top-notch officers ready to be part of his fraudulent scheme to clear competitive examinations. A decade back, the CBI arrested Ranjit from Delhi.Last week, too, the CBI apprehended Sanjivs conduit from Noida and arrested his PO wife at Nalanda, but Sanjiv, who brought disgrace to his native place, remained untraced. But there is a flip side to the story: this is the same Nalanda from where farmers Sumant Kumar and Rakesh Kumar set world records in paddy and potato production respectively some time back.Nalanda, which gave the country leaders like Nitish Kumar, has a glorious past. This was the place which gave the world its first university  Nalanda University. Established during the reign of Kumara Gupta-I (AD 414-445 ), Nalanda University was arguably the highest seat of Buddhist learning.Spread over in nearly two square kilometres, it had about 1500 professors and 10,000 students. Legend has it that scholars such as Panini and Jivaka studied there. According to Chinese scholar Hieun Tsang, it was a six-storey building where the staff and students had a free boarding and lodging."

Sinnar, Yeola and Deola tehsils have been chosen for the project.This is part of NABARD's project on cash crops like onion, potato and tomato with often fluctuating rates of production, resulting in uncertain fortunes for farmers. NABARD launched the project to increase onion production and better the quality of the onions, consequently ensuring better sales.""Onion is a very important crop of Maharashtra, with 44 per cent of the crop grown in the country being grown here. The economy of the district depends majorly on onion cultivation. Due to traditional methods of growing and storing onions, 40 per cent of the crop rots away. There aren't enough quality seeds and hybrid seeds affect the production and quality of onions. Suffering losses seems regular. That is why NABARD started this value chain management project of onion. We have already started training the farmers in batches,"" Sunil Pote, founder, Yuva Mitra, told TOI on Friday.Farmers are being trained in scientific methods of growing and storing onions, right from the sowing stage to the harvesting stage. The training will conclude in end-November. ""In-depth guidance and suggestions on compost management, water management, insects and disease management, harvest and sale management will be offered,"" said Pote.Farmers have been divided into groups from each village for the training. Nineteen groups in Wadangali, 22 in Dhodi and 23 in Pathre village have been formed so far; each with 25-27 farmers.""Traditional methods like growing onions on a flat bed will be replaced by a raised bed, so that water can be supplied through drip irrigation and the temperature can also be maintained in the raised bed while sowing. Spaces between two onion plants and two rows of plants will be maintained well with the raised bed method of sowing,"" said Shital Dange, a Yuva Mitra volunteer.""In traditional methods of storing, farmers make heaps of onion under trees, in cow sheds, or even in a corner of their houses. Much of the crop is spoilt due to weather conditions in these methods of storage. NABARD will offer loans to farmers with minimum interest to set up proper storage facilities,"" said the volunteers.Pote said that a society of farmers, Green Vision, will be established. Onions will be sold directly to consumers, without any middlemen, through this society."
232,Street vendors looking for a fair deal in Bihar,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Street-vendors-looking-for-a-fair-deal-in-Bihar/articleshow/23601532.cms,2013-10-06,The Times Of India,"Every evening, he trundles through the lanes of New Patliputra Colony, signalling his presence with a thump and a clang, pausing gingerly at the gates of those known to have a penchant for a hot potato filling wrapped in rice crepe. Ramesh the Dosawallah is one of the many street vendors who contribute to the flavour of life in the colony, a pleasant fixture on the daily grind, just like the grey-haired vegetable man, who precisely at 10 O'clock everyday participates in a bargaining ritual over the prices of 'nenua' or 'parbal' with the paisa-pinching pensioner who lives upstairs.Ramesh and the sabziwallah with the loud voice, may not have realized it, but the streets of Patna have become a safer, more friendly environment from September 9, the day a Supreme Court bench comprising of Justice G.S. Singhvi and Justice V. Gopala Gowda directed all state governments and the Union Territories' administrators to ensure formation of Town Vending Committee (TVC) within two months and registration of all street vendors within four months. The direction will be binding till the enactment of the central law to protect the livelihood of street vendors.In our towns and cities, street vendors - roving hawkers like Ramesh or pavement hawkers like the fish-seller who has 'captured' the pavement across Don Bosco School in Patliputra - are rarely treated with dignity and tolerance. They are targeted by municipalities and police as illegal traders, the urban middle class constantly complains about how these vendors block pavements, create traffic problems and engage in alleged 'antisocial activities'. More often than not, the same chaps who complain prefer to buy from street vendors because they are cheaper and offer quality comparable to goods sold in the overpriced departmental stores and shopping malls.Arbind Singh, the National coordinator of NASVI (the National Association of Street Vendors in India), began the first steps of this long journey for the protection of vendors' livelihood from Patna, in the late 1990s. At that time, his organization 'Nidan' was working with urban slum dwellers, many of whom sold stuff on pavements or on carts, earning a precarious livelihood. A meeting with activists of SEWA (the Self-Employed Women's Association) in Ahmedabad, and realization that the urban poor would never really kick poverty unless their means of livelihood could be protected, evolved into NASVI in 1998, with Arbind Singh, albeit a bit reticent and reluctant, at the helm of affairs. But the passage of the Street Vendors Bill that protects vendors from police harassment isn't enough. It's a long road ahead. Bureaucrats aren't street vendor friendly, and their attitude isn't going to change overnight.""It's imperative that we urge the Government of Bihar to follow the Supreme Court order and ensure town vending committees are set up within the next 60 days. Street vendors should be registered by January 2014,"" says Singh. Did you know that street vendors form 2.5% of a city's working population?""For most street vendors, trading is full of uncertainties. They are constantly harassed by the authorities. The local bodies conduct eviction drives to clear the pavements of these encroachers and in most cases confiscate their goods. A municipal raid is like a cat-and-mouse game with municipal workers chasing street vendors away while these people try to run away and hide from these marauders. Confiscation of their goods entails heavy fines for recovery. In most cases, it means that the vendor has to take loans from private sources (at exorbitant interest) to either recover whatever remains of his confiscated goods or to restart his business. Street vendors have to regularly bribe the authorities in order to carry out their business. A substantive income from street vending is spent on greasing the palms of unscrupulous authorities or to private money lenders. Street vendors have to survive in a hostile environment though they are service providers,"" say Bhowmik and Saha in a report on 'Street Vending in Ten Cities in India'.""Claims of pro-poor good governance and inclusive development fall flat in Bihar as long as the large population of street vendors remains insecure and marginalized. Two years ago, Bihar government announced it would create vending zones at all urban centres, but nothing has happened so far. The administration and the police ride roughshod on poor street vendors and harass and evict them under this or that pretext,"" says Singh.Last year when street vendors in Patna, Rajgir, Dalsinghsarai, Muzaffarpur and Motihari protested the eviction drives, the evictors had to retreat. NASVI supported the vendors and took up the issues with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the urban development minister, respective DMs and SPs. The State Human Rights Commission also took up the issue with respective district administrations.Two months ago on August 5, policemen led by the Rajgir subdivisional magistrate descended on the streets to chase away vendors. Some 500 street vendors strongly protested the eviction move and demanded proper alternative arrangements. The agitating vendors encircled the SDM and threatened that if they faced forced eviction, they would launch an anti-police, anti- government movement. NASVI functionaries from Delhi called the DM and Rajgir SDM demanding a halt on the eviction drive and protection of the vendors' right to livelihood as guaranteed by the Constitution and several verdicts of the Supreme Court of India. The protest and the NASVI intervention halted the drive, but again on August 29, the police attempted to break the carts and stalls of vendors, but they could not succeed in the face of stiff resistance posed by the vendors and their families, women and children.Earlier this week, NASVI and Nidan hosted an informal get-together to remember the journey. The evening discussion was attended by jurists, administrators, journalists, and development experts. But what matters to Ramesh, the grey-haired man, the woman fish-seller and the rest of the 2.5 per cent workforce is how quick Bihar's towns get their vending committees."

Things have gone out of hand this time. I think I will have to spend a minimum of Rs 200 every day on fruits for the next few days.

He said farmers work hard but earn little.""Potatoes sell for Rs 10 per kilo, while potato chips cost almost 400 times more. With this food processing unit in Amethi, we aim to ensure that farmers earn a larger share of the profits than they do now,"" Rahul said. But conspicuous by his absence was chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who stayed away from the foundation-laying ceremony where Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, too, was present.""All of UP's mango gets exported. I want UP's farm produce to be processed in Amethi. I want Amethi to become an agriculture hub,"" Rahul said. Promising a cargo terminal at the Fursatganj air strip to facilitate export of processed foods, he said he would return to inaugurate the embattled-Hindustan Paper Mill that will benefit nearly 10,000 people with employment. Kumar Mangalam Birla, praising Rahul as a development-oriented politician, said the food park would act as a platform where farm produce would be managed in a transparent and efficient manner. ""This project will boost UP's economic status and create direct and indirect employment for 2,500 and 25,000 people,"" said Birla. Without mentioning an absent AKhilesh, Birla said he was grateful to UP government for helping in setting up of the project. Minister of state for agriculture and food processing Charan Das Mahant said the food park envisaged trebling the farmers' incomes."
236,Rahul woos farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131008/jsp/nation/story_17436824.jsp,2013-10-08,Telegraph,"Lucknow, Oct. 7: Rahul Gandhi today lamented that Uttar Pradesh farmers werent getting fair prices for their produce, renewing a pitch to woo a section known to back the ruling Samajwadi Party.Which is the largest mango-producing state in India? the Congress vice-president asked farmers at an event to lay the foundation for a food park in his constituency, Amethi. Uttar Pradesh, the audience roared back.But a hush descended after Rahuls next question: Where do these mangoes get processed before being exported? He then said it was Delhi, before adding he wanted that done in Amethi.Rahul said he envisaged Amethi as the states agro-processing hub, holding up the Shaktiman Mega Food Park as a step towards the goal.Rahuls attempt to win the support of the farmers comes ahead of next years general elections. In 2011, he had visited Bhatta Parsaul village, a pocket near Noida rocked by land acquisition protests during Mayawatis reign. But the efforts didnt help much: the Congress won only 28 of the 403 seats in the 2012 state polls, a shade better than 22 in 2007.A reminder of the challenges came even as Rahul was speaking today. Some Congress workers from Amethi led by a zilla parishad chief joined the Samajwadis, said ruling party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.In his speech, the Congress vice-president cited wafer prices to argue how farmers were getting a raw deal.

He said farmers work hard but earn little.""Potatoes sell for Rs 10 per kilo, while potato chips cost almost 400 times more. With this food processing unit in Amethi, we aim to ensure that farmers earn a larger share of the profits than they do now,"" Rahul said. But conspicuous by his absence was chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who stayed away from the foundation-laying ceremony where Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, too, was present.""All of UP's mango gets exported. I want UP's farm produce to be processed in Amethi. I want Amethi to become an agriculture hub,"" Rahul said. Promising a cargo terminal at the Fursatganj air strip to facilitate export of processed foods, he said he would return to inaugurate the embattled-Hindustan Paper Mill that will benefit nearly 10,000 people with employment.Kumar Mangalam Birla, praising Rahul as a development-oriented politician, said the food park would act as a platform where farm produce would be managed in a transparent and efficient manner.""This project will boost UP's economic status and create direct and indirect employment for 2,500 and 25,000 people,"" said Birla. Without mentioning an absent AKhilesh, Birla said he was grateful to UP government for helping in setting up of the project. Minister of state for agriculture and food processing Charan Das Mahant said the food park envisaged trebling the farmers' incomes.Birla was part of the Amar Singh-led UP Development Corporation in the Mulayam-led SP government in 2007. The group's Rs 200 crore food processing project, sources in the government confirmed, is the largest investment - apart from the power sector - that has come to UP under the Akhilesh-led SP government.Political observers say that while Akhilesh keeps harping on transforming UP into an ""investment hub"", sharing the dais with the Aditya Birla group chairman would have shown his seriousness. Akhilesh's deliberate distancing from the launch despite ""no pressing engagements"" also fuelled talks of the SP Third Front agenda."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Oct. 10: The cyclone alert has escalated prices of essential commodities at city markets. As memories of the 1999 super cyclone haunt residents, they have started stocking food items. This has pushed up potato prices by Rs 6 a kg at Unit-I market, where it is now selling for Rs 18 a kg. At other markets, potatoes are being sold for Rs 24 per kg. Moreover, stuffs such as flattened rice (chuda), gudda (molasses), flour (atta), candle and matches have been vanished from markets as people have purchased these fearing severity of the storm. However an official of the state food supply and consumer welfare department said they would ensure that the essential items remained available in abundance to meet the need, which might arise during the cyclone-hitting period. We have also kept stocks of chuda, rice, candle and matches at several stock points in the city. We have instructed the dealers of these items to keep stock of such essential products and not to create any artificial shortage in the market, he said. But, the panic-buying has already created a shortage of the products in the market. Chuda, which is an essential food item during disaster periods in the state, has gone vanished at the city shops. Yesterday, I sold a few kilograms of chuda. As I am running short of this item, I sent my men to the Unit-I wholesale market to buy around 20kg of flattened rice. But, traders there said they, too, were short of this stuff, said Amarseh Sahu, a grocer at Kharavela Nagar. A supply official said chuda became scarce in the market as it could not be produced more due to prolonged rain for the past few days. But, we have kept stock of around 300 quintal chuda and molasses at stock points at Unit-I, Unit-IV, Aiginia and other places in the city. Besides, we have asked the mills to keep the stock of chuda. Wholesale dealers of candle and matches have also been asked to keep these things in abundance. We are in constant touch with them to keep the products in abundance, he said. He said they had also instructed the rice mills and wholesalers to keep rice in stock and sell them to meet the demands. If we get to know that any artificial shortage has been created, we will raid the shops, he said. A shopkeeper said those, who used to purchase 2kg of potato for two to three days, were now buying at least 10kg at a time. Some retailers on the city outskirts are also trying to take advantage of the situation. We do not want to create any panic or create a situation for hoarding. But, excess purchase by the panic-stricken people may lead to a shortage, said president of the Rajadhani Haata Byabasayi Mahasangha Gayadhar Swian. Sources said the scarcity of potato there was a delay in potato supply. At least 14 trucks of potato will arrive in the city this evening and few more tomorrow. However, onion import from Karnataka through Andhra Pradesh has received a jolt due to the formation of Telangana."

Well, bhog lovers, you're in luck this year. Rise in commodity prices have not affected preparations to serve delectable food for gods at the older pujas, while the others are doing their best to live up to your bhog expectations.Bhog is served at all Bengali clubs during the four-day Durga Puja festivities. It is first offered to the Goddess along with bhog aarti. To eat it is to be blessed by Goddess Durga.With Puja on in full swing, puja committees are busy churning our elaborate bhog menus. For some puja committees, the hiked commodity rates have not affected the menu for bhog while others are trying their best to work out the menu within their budget.Restaurants and hotels too are serving up special Puja menus. Bengali restaurants have brought in cooks from Kolkata so that the food served is authentic.Like previous years, this year too, the city's oldest puja, Hari Sabha, has kept the bhog menu unchanged. The committee has been preparing the same bhog for 99 years. Here, bhog means mouth-watering khichdi, mixed vegetable curry, fries and payesh (kheer).""We have not changed the bhog menu in the past 99 years. In the afternoon and evening, the menu is be the same. This year, the prices of all commodities have gone up, but this has not upset our menu at all. More than 5,000 people come on the three days of Puja to partake of our bhog. So we have to make enough for them all. People are also served items similar to the those offered to Goddess Durga. We offer the bhog to Maa on a silver platter,"" said Dilip Chandra Goswami, a member of Hari Sabha.He said 50 per cent of the items - such as sweets, milk, vegetables, rice and dal - are provided by the people. The rest is arranged for by the committee. ""We don't serve food on plastic plates. We prefer banana leaves and bring them in by the thousands. We used to serve water in clay glasses too, but since these glasses are not available anymore, we have been forced to replace them with plastic ones,"" he added.The bhog menu at Ramakrishna Mission consists of 13 items, including non-vegetarian dishes. The items are - a potato preparation, boiled papaya, shak, shukto, aloo posto, fish curry, fries, mixed vegetable curry, payesh, chutney, curd, sada bhat, ghee bhat, khichdi and coconut water.For breakfast, the Goddess is served fruits and sweets. The evening bhog consists of luchi, aloo dum in addition to the above mentioned items.Swami Atma Bratananda of Ramakrishna Mission said, ""For the past 27 years, we have been serving the same items for bhog on the three days of Puja. Around 25,000 people visit the temple and we make sure that everyone who visits the temple to seek blessings receives bhog. The devotees don't have to pay anything for bhog. It is prepared in bulk, but the taste is divine. Fish is not served to the people, though it's made only for Maa. Everything is arranged with the help of contributions made by the devotees. Last year, mixed vegetable curry and pickle was not on the menu.""Rest Camp Kalibari Durgaostav committee has introduced a coupon system to distribute the bhog in an attempt to tackle the rush. Tapash Naha, a member of the committee, said, ""We have decided on a different menu for the three days. We are serving varied items, from fried rice to payesh. Because of the huge rush, at times some people do not get bhog. So, we have introduced a coupon system to buy the bhog. This year, commodity rates have shot up, so the quantity of bhog will definitely be less than other years."""

NH-54 links the Mizoram Aizawl with Silchar in Assam.Of the 10 LPG distributors in the state, only three are being able to supply LPG cylinders to consumers in a very limited quantity while petrol and diesel are available at only a handful of petrol pumps in the Mizoram capital. Aizawl has a total of 12 petrol pumps.The state food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department issued an appeal to the public to resort to austerity measure, particularly with regard to cooking gas, as different reasons have been attributed to the shortage of LPG supply.Non-arrival of consumer items has created severe problems for the common people as essential commodities including milk, onion, edible oil and potato have run out of stock at grocery stores in the state capital.The prices of building materials have also skyrocketed. While the price of cement have gone up from Rs 400/ bag to Rs 480/ bag, price of sand has also gone through the roof. The state government's failure to control prices coupled with large scale hoarding of essential commodities by unscrupulous traders have resulted in the steep rise in prices of all commodities throughout the state.The opposition Mizo National Front (MNF) alleged that the contractor of the NH-54, the Assam-based Anupam Bricks and Concrete Industries Limited (ABCIL) owned by Jodhraj Baid, a close friend of state chief minister Lalthanhawla. An MNF press statement accused the chief minister of giving undue favour to the contractor. The MNF has also alleged that the contractor concerned did not follow the instructions of the engineers of the state PWD because of his association with Lalthanhawla.""The fact that the work, which began in 2009, was scheduled to be completed by April 2011. However, the contractor even after using sub-standard material could not complete the work till date,"" the statement said.The MNF statement also alleged that contractor was given additional Rs 52 crore above the original estimate.Drivers of vehicles carrying supplies stranded in the highway for days said they were facing acute shortage of food stuff as prices of rice have shot up to Rs 60 per kilo and a 250 gram pack of dal costs Rs 50."

Vegetables prices have doubled in most cases largely because of fall in supply caused by the rain. Most vegetables are now selling at over Rs 100 a kg. In the wholesale market, too, vegetables which cost around Rs 20-30 per kg till a week back are now priced at Rs 50-60 per kg.To give an example, coccinia grandis (tendolia) which was available in the retail market for Rs 60 till about a week back, is now selling at Rs 120 a kg. In the wholesale market, it was selling at Rs 40 a kg but it is now priced at Rs 80 per kg. Not just coccinia but the prices of almost all vegetables have skyrocketed. Officials of the Jamalpur wholesale market said that even okra (bhindi), which cost Rs 30-35 a kg in the retail market till recently, is now selling at over Rs 60-70 per kg.APMC Jamalpur secretary, Deepak Patel, said that income from vegetables had dropped in the market and this was because of the heavy rain in South Gujarat, Saurashtra and even North Gujarat. ""Farmers were not able to get into their fields as the fields are waterlogged. This is the reason for the short supply and the resultant rise in vegetable prices,"" Patel said. He, however, said that the situation will definitely get back to normal within the next three-four days.Karan Vaghela, a vegetable retailer in Satellite area, said that prices might not increase further as heavy rain is now unlikely in the state. But vegetable prices will come down only next week. He further said that this is normal as prices go up whenever there is heavy rain in the state.Housewives in the city are having a tough time balancing their domestic budget. Bindu Modi, a resident of Memnagar, said that for a family of three, she used to spend Rs 400-500 on vegetables which lasted a week. This was in the first week of July. But the bill for vegetables now has increased to about Rs 800 per week.""To manage expenses, I have started adding potatoes in each and every vegetable. Earlier, I used to cook 250-350 grams of bhindi but now I buy the same quantity but use only half of it at one time,"" she said.Similar feelings were echoed by Jayshree Patel a resident of satellite, ""The wholesale rates are high as well. I usually go to Kalupur to buy vegetables once a week. But, the prices have also doubled in the since the first week of October. We are a joint family and hence the consumption of vegetable was very high and hence have no option but to go to Kalupur. I use to buy Guvar at Rs 35-40 per kg, but this week it was over Rs 70-80."""

However, had the film been shot now, he would have to reconsider this view. The fruit has become costlier. Those days are gone when one could eat five bananas in lunch by spending just Rs 5. Now, one banana costs Rs 5.The rising prices of onion and potato have put these vegetables out of menu for many poor and lower middle class families. Now banana too would be out of bounds for them. The price of banana was between Re 1 and Rs 2 for a piece till September, but from October it started to rise because of inflation. A big-sized banana costs Rs 5 while a smaller one could be bought for Rs 4.Malti Patel, a resident of Bhatar Road, removed banana from the list of 'prasad' during Navratri garba 'puja' due to increase in its price. ""I planned to keep 'shira' and banana in 'prasad.' I wanted to give one banana with some snacks to each garba player in my society but had to change the plan. I served the garba players only snacks,"" she said.Praful Desai, a school teacher, regularly purchased 12 bananas for Rs 15 for his family of four. But now he purchases four bananas for Rs 20. ""I would have got 15 bananas in Rs 20 till a couple of weeks ago. All the fruits have become very costly,"" said Desai, a resident of Rander Road.""Banana prices have gone up due to rise in the overall transportation cost and inflation. We have to pay more to the transporter and as labour costs,"" said Surendra Pande, a fruit vendor at Sardar Market.The high demand is also leading to increase in the price of banana, traders believe.

Homemakers, already reeling under spiralling inflation coupled with festive expenditure, must brace for a further rise in prices of vegetables as the cyclone has severely affected farm yield. If wholesalers in Ranchi are to be believed, rates of potatoes have gone up by 50 per cent within a week and might escalate further. President of Ranchi Daily Market Vendors Association Md Siroz said potatoes, which cost Rs 7 per kg till a few days ago, were now being sold at Rs 10 a kg. The extended monsoon and the cyclone have damaged crops across the state. Jharkhand and Odisha depend on Bengal for their supply of old potatoes. Now, with demands rising in Odisha, prices will rise for other states too, he said. Siroz added that the cost of a truck of potatoes had gone up from Rs 70,000 last week to Rs 1.2 lakh. Exporters from Bengal have straightaway hiked Rs 5 per kg for a tonne of potato, he rued. Vegetable vendor Md Salim apprehend that the rise in potato prices would have an impact on the rates of other vegetables. Potato is called sabjiyon ka raja. It has been seen that whenever potato prices increase, other green vegetables become expensive too, he said. Siroz said that onions and tomatoes were expected to come dearer as locally grown varieties had been washed away. Onions that come from Nasik and other places are of inferior quality as dealers prefer to sell the good ones to Delhi and other metros where they fetch higher prices. Locally grown tomatoes have turned bad due to incessant rains. The remaining ones will obviously be priced higher owing to less supply, he said. Director of ICAR, Palandu, S. Kumar, said that vegetable crop coverage in Jharkhand was grossly around 2.40lakh hectare annually. Citizens will have to wait till the winter harvest for prices to stabilise, said Kumar."
250,Bhubaneswar returns to normality,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131016/jsp/odisha/story_17456612.jsp,2013-10-16,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, Oct. 15: Roads have been cleared and power is back in most parts of the city. Life is returning to normality here two days after Phailin hit the state. While the civic authorities and various other agencies helped evacuate people from low-lying areas and slums during the gale, roads were cleared of hundreds of fallen trees by the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation officials. Basic civic amenities such as power and water supply were restored within 24 hours in most of the areas. The Central Electricity Supply Utility had constituted three teams each under three divisions in the city to ensure power supply by cutting fallen trees immediately after the disaster. The Public Health Engineering Organisation has arranged generators for managing water supply needs. The city residents, who suffered a lot during the 1999 super cyclone, recalled the experience of the past. We were forced to take water from the sump pits by ourselves as there was no electricity. It took around a week for restoration of emergency services such as water and electricity supply. But, it is because of the preparedness of the authorities this time that these services have been restored so quickly, said Dibakar Sahu, a resident of Rasulgarh. This time, the corporation had accommodated more than 97,000 people living in the slums and other low-lying areas at 168 places, including six kalyan mandaps and several community centres. Similarly, eight teams of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force helped the civic body in evacuation and post-cyclone operations. While most of the roads were cleared within 24 hours of the disaster, the civic body has so far managed to clear 74 per cent of green debris. The remaining green debris will be cleared by tomorrow evening, said municipal commissioner Sanjib Kumar Mishra. Though electricity has been restored in various areas including Rasulgarh, Patia and Nayapalli, other areas such as Unit-II, Baramunda and Unit-VIII are yet to get electricity. The city also received a rainfall of more than 150mm creating waterlogging in low-lying areas. Wind blowing at a speed of 112km an hour uprooted scores of trees. On the other hand, prices of essential commodities including chura and potato have sky rocketed with residents rushing to grocery shops in the wake of Phailin. Long queues, which were seen at petrol pumps on the eve of the cyclone, are not visible anymore."

Similarly, potato prices shot up from Monday's Rs 1,200 per quintal to Rs 1,500 per quintal. The sharp hike came just after the festival of Navratri and a day ahead of Bakri Eid.""Despite the inflation, we still get Rs 12-15 per kg of onions when we sell to local traders,"" said Pandurang Gulve, a farmer from Solapur.Onions from Pakistan, China, Israel and Afghanistan have failed to lure local buyers since they are priced at same levels as the domestic produce. ""Farmers need to reap the crop in dry condition but the extended monsoon played spoilsport. Onion crops are getting damaged in most parts of the state. We can't say when prices will dip,"" said Ashok Walunj, director of the onion-potato market.Further, only 60 trucks came to the market on Tuesday, compared to Monday's 80 truckloads. While APMC officials blamed short supply owing to the extended monsoon, some traders said a majority of workers involved in the loading, unloading and transporting were on leave for Eid. ""Though harvesting time is fast approaching, we fear it will be tough just before Diwali, when a shortage of workers is likely,"" said Manohar Totlani, a trader.Potatoes continue to arrive from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab as well as from Satara, Sangli and Pune. Still, prices shot up on Tuesday ostensibly due to less supply, with just 70 trucks in the market from 100 trucks earlier.Vegetable prices are also moving northwards due to supply fluctuations from Pune, Satara, Sangli, Sangameshwar and Nashik. ""Supply has been fluctuating last week, which affects prices, but it's more or less stable unlike onion,"" said Shankar Pingle, a former APMC director.Market experts said prices of these essential commodities were usually affected before and after festivals due to supply fluctuations. In fact, the supply chain of onion has changed course from Nashik to southern India. While Nashik reportedly has a stock of old onions which could last another fortnight, the Mumbai APMC is procuring new onions from Dharwad, Hubli, Yashwantnagar and Bangalore. While the APMC gets 20% of its supply from Nashik, the rest comes from the south at cheaper prices. ""Dharwad onions are smaller and cheaper by Rs 5,"" said Neelam Patil, a homemaker.A major factor to blame for rising prices is the seven-tier supply chain in Maharashtra, comprising the farmer-producer, local trader, commission agent, wholesaler, semi-wholesaler, retailer and the consumer. Two years ago, the Centre had ordered dismissal of the APMC, to pave the way for direct marketing by farmers, eliminating middlemen. But Maharashtra is yet to implement the directive."

The price of vegetables, especially onions, has gone up again after the nine-day festival. With the end of the Shradh and Navratras, when people avoid eating meat, its price increased between Rs 20 and Rs 50 from Monday.""Increase in the price of onion is shocking. When it cost Rs 70 per kg, wholesalers expected prices to fall in the month of October. However, nothing has changed. The price of onions, which went down to Rs 50/kg in the festive season, has gone up again,"" said Nimesh Singh of Chandigarh Road.Experts attribute the price hike to storm and unseasonal rain in many parts of the country. ""Prices were low in the festive season as most people avoid meat and onion. But now that the festive season is over, there will be more demand. Prices of vegetables could rise as there is no fresh stock in the market, said Mangat Sharma, a wholesaler from the main vegetable market on Jalandhar Bypaas.According to a government report on Monday, onion prices pushed up inflation as wholesale prices rose by a 322% in September against 244% in August. Although officials claim prices will fall by the end of the month, there is hardly any indication of the situation improving at least in the next one week.Residents who reached wholesale markets unaware of the hike in prices of vegetables and meat said, ""the condition is going worse. There is no hike in our salaries but price is on the rise continuously."" Ramesh Dubey, a businessman from Ghumar Mandi said, ""I visited the wholesale market thinking I would get vegetables for cheaper but the price of onion, which was Rs 50/kg one week ago, has risen to Rs 70.Price of many vegetables like beans and capsicum have also risen to Rs 70 from Rs 50 two weeks ago. This has shaken my budget."" Vegetables which have seen maximum price hike in the fortnight are onion, capsicum, coriander, cauliflower and green chilies. However, vegetables like potatoes and tomatoes are still priced at Rs 20 and Rs 40 respectively. The price of non-vegetarian products has increased by Rs 20 to Rs 50 in the last one month. Mutton has reached from Rs 340 per kg to Rs 360 per kg; chicken has reached from Rs 180 per kg to Rs 220 per kg and the price of fish has gone above Rs 300/ kg from Rs 180/kg. The price of eggs has gone up from Rs 90 / tray to Rs 120 / tray. But the prices may vary from shop to shop in different areas, depending on the product varieties.The rising inflation has left residents feeling upset and resentful. Pankaj Singh, a resident of Model Town said, ""Now, we shall start eating grass as vegetable as other edibles will be available in jewellery shops."" Some residents are patient as they feel the price rise was caused by the vagaries of weather. ""The government should not be blamed for rising prices. Natural calamities like heavy rainfall led to price rise. Being responsible citizens, we must adjust and understand problems at the basic level,"" said Mandeep Singh Sarna, a resident of BRS Nagar.""The festive season is not enjoyable for the middle class because of rising prices. A few years ago, it was difficult for people of the middle class to buy dry fruits. But it seems that now fruits will also go out of their reach because of their skyrocketing prices. The worst part is that even basic food articles like salt have become expensive"", said Ravinder Pal Singh, a hapless resident of Sarabha Nagar."

While the APMC was closed for Eid and traders sold old stock from Tuesday, sources said the spiraling prices were due to the presence of middlemen.""I bought onions on Monday at Rs 65 per kg but today it stood at Rs 80. It is unjust on the part of local retailers to use poor stock and high demand on a holiday to hike prices,"" said Prithi Machando from Mulund. Ajay Gawade, a Chembur resident, said, ""Retailers are looting people in the name of short supply which is not the fact at all. They are exploiting consumers who have no other choice. Average vegetable prices are more than Rs 65 per kg. The government should step in to regulate them.""However, officials continued to blame short supply for the price hike. Traders said they anticipated another tough day when the market reopens. ""If Tuesday's situation continues on Thursday with poor supply, prices of onions and potatoes will certainly increase in the wholesale market. Retailers will also take advantage of it,"" said a trader.Both consumers and farmers are fed up with the seven-tier chain.Other states have done away with the APMC to encourage farmers. ""We need the state government to take a call, which will fade market monopoly. Farmers and consumers are at the receiving end due to low profit and high shell-out respectively,"" said a trader. ""If the APMC is eliminated we can have direct contact with wholesalers,"" said Dhiraj Kutwal, a farmer from Pune.Central government had two years back ordered dismissal of APMC committee to pave the way for liberal and direct marketing by farmers, eliminating middlemen. Maharashtra is yet to implement the directive. The variation in the chain includes loading, unloading, commission at different levels, transportation, stock and profit."

However, in wholesale, at present onion is priced at Rs 50 per kg.

The price of garlic in local mandis is Rs 60 per kg and wholesale Rs 32-35 per kg, whereas a week earlier, it was available for Rs 40 per kg.Satish Sonkar, president of Uttar Pradesh Fruits and Vegetables Sellers and Growers Association, said, ""The rains caused the reduction of stock of vegetables grown in the city. Hence, most of the vegetables have been imported from other states. The increased cost of warehousing and transportation also fuelled the price of vegetables.""Sonkar added that a few days back, the price of onion had fallen because its consumption decreased during Navratra. The consumers will get respite in the first week of November when the new stock on onion will hit the market.The skyrocketing prices of vegetables have come as yet another blow for the people already reeling under high inflation rate. A housewife, Tanu Joshi, said, ""It has been a month since we have used onion. If the prices of other vegetables will continue to rise, what we will eat then?""Seconding her opinion, Ankit Pandey, a private executive who has subscribed to tiffin service said, ""Due to soaring vegetables prices, I often get to eat same vegetable daily. The lady who provides me tiffin complains that she is unable to meet the cost and repeats the cheapest vegetables."""

Though, many have cut down on the consumption of the vegetables, some are not deterred by the prices as they don't want to compromise on their regular menu.""Of course we are feeling the heat of the price rise. However, I do not want to compromise on the health of my children and so I am not bothered about spending more on vegetables,"" J Seetha, a mother of two from Theppakulam, said. But, K Shakthi, a resident of Munichalai, had a different opinion. ""I am running my home on a fixed budget. It is not feasible for me to spend an extra amount of Rs100 every week on vegetables. As I don't have any other option, I have to limit the purchase,"" she said.The price of the vegetable seems to be different in each market in Madurai and the representatives of these markets have their own explanation for the price. However, the general opinion is that the price of the vegetables has spiraled in last six months. However, the price of vegetables is cheaper in 'Uzhavar Santhai' (farmers' market).While the price of the vegetables is very high in K Pudur market, one of the biggest retail markets in the city, the price seems to be better in Mattuthavani integrated vegetable market. Talking about it, K Arumugam, agriculture officer associated with the Chockikulam farmers' market, said, ""The price of the veggies is very high now compared to what it was in March this year. However, the price is a little better compared to the previous month. Vegetable prices would be lesser here always as we constantly monitor them and take steps to control them,"" he added. Talking about the difference in prices, M Neethirajan, secretary of K Pudur vegetable retail market, said that the price rise is not uniform. ""The price of vegetables has been on the rise in the last six months. The prices of some of the vegetables like beans, carrot, tomato, onion ands potato have doubled. Beans, carrot and tomato are sold at Rs 50, Rs 60 and Rs 40 respectively compared to Rs 30, Rs 30 and Rs 40 respectively six months ago. However, the prices of brinjal and ladies finger remain the same at Rs 40 and 20 respectively,"" he said.However, commenting on price rise and retail sales, Neethirajan added that people are judicious in purchasing as the sales of high pricing vegetables such as onion and butter beans are less. However, other vegetables are sold in usual quantities.Talking about the wholesale price of vegetables, T Murugan of Mattuthavani central market, said, the prices of vegetables from Kodaikanal have gone up considerably. These include carrot, potato, beans, cabbage and cauliflower. The price rise is due to the shortage in the production. However, the prices of the locally available vegetables like brinjal, ladies finger and drumstick are comparatively cheaper, he said.""When the price of the particular vegetable is higher the marketers would reduce the quantity of purchase as people would not show much interest in purchasing high-priced vegetables,"" he added."

Our margin has also reduced. Earlier we made a decent Rs. 4 per kg, now were lucky to make Rs. 2.Ravichandra Shetty, Manager of HOPCOMS vegetable store in Karangalpady, said that this price rise was not due to any rainfall-related or climatic conditions but because of hoarding and lobbying in the State. He said, Onions, tomatoes and potatoes are staple food and people will buy them even if the prices are higher. Along the same lines, Valencia resident Sunita said, We need to buy nearly 2 kg onions for a week, we cannot compromise on this because of the cost.Nevertheless, wholesale dealer at Central Market J. Shekar believes Mangalore may not be hit adversely by the soaring prices in relation to other regions because of the influx of onions from places such as Shimoga and Chikmagalur.

And, if the vegetable vendors are to be believed, a further spurt is on the cards furrowing the eyebrows of the housewives. The way onion prices are shooting through the roof, it does not only pinch us, but also makes us feel we should avoid it altogether. But as my family members are crazy about non-vegetarian dishes, I have to strike a right balance, tells Mita Sharat, a housewife in Navaratanhata in Purnia.How many things do you give a miss? quipped Suman Gami in Katihar. It is not only onion prices which have zoomed, the price of potatoes, too, has been spiralling selling at Rs 16 per kg while it was pegged at Rs 10 per kg only a week back. The new variety of potato is now priced at Rs 40 per kg.Likewise, if garlic prices have soared to Rs 200 per kg, so have the prices of other items which add to the richness of delectable dishes. Pumpkins are no longer the commoners choice. They, too, are now quite fanciful with prices going skywards and selling Rs 35 per piece. Mutton and chicken are now selling at Rs 360 and Rs 150 to Rs 160 per kg respectively.There is no mechanism in place to check the prices. It is free for all with supply and demand theory getting somewhat obsolete. Oddly, price tags are rather determined or rather manipulated by cellphones and news channels, say the vegetable sellers in Purnia and Katihar.If prices of onions and other vegetables shoot through the roof in Delhi or other metropolitan cities, we do not suffer any qualms in hiking them here too, admits a vegetable vendor Kalam at Kishanganj. There is no effort on the part of the government to monitor the prices, rues Hari Prakash in Purnia.Incidentally, truckloads of onions and potatoes are systematically carried into neighbouring Bangladesh from huge vegetable mundi on Bihar-West Bengal border near Kishanganj. Unhindered smuggling of these items only add to the spurt in their prices, admit local vegetable vendors."

After a brief thaw, the price has spiralled to over Rs. 60 a kg for a good quality produce in the retail market in the city.On Tuesday, the price in Bangalore ranged between Rs. 30 and over Rs. 60 a kg, depending on quality. While the price for a good quality onion had hovered around Rs. 70 a kg early September, it had come down to less than Rs. 50 towards the end of September.With onion price in Delhi making headlines after it inched closer to the Rs. 100-mark, traders here are attributing this the nationwide increase in the price due to shortage and also poor quality. Demand from north and eastern States for Karnataka onions has also pulled up the price here, traders say.In Bangalore, the wholesale price of good quality onion sourced from Chitradurga area is hovering around Rs. 50 a kg at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) at Yeshwantpur, while the retail price is between Rs. 60 and Rs. 70 a kg.The wholesale price of medium quality onion and small-sized onion called as gulti in market parlance is about Rs. 40 and Rs. 20 a kg respectively.Commission, cess, transport and porters cost besides the retail margins push up the price by the time it reaches the consumers, traders said.S. Balakrishna, vice-president of Bangalore Potato and Onion Merchants Association, said that the price has moved up here because of high demand from neighbouring States as well as demand for onion from some northern and eastern States which are facing shortage.Normally the price of onion in October will be between Rs. 25 and Rs. 30, but this time, the price increased due to crop failure in major onion-growing States, he added.Traders from other States are camping here to buy onions and transport them to their regions, Mr. Balakrishna said .He added that a good crop this season could have brought down the price of these essential vegetable to less than Rs. 20 a kg.The price started moving upwards after Dasara since onion from Nasik/ Pune region is of poor quality. This high price is expected to remain till midNovember when quality onions are expected, Karisiddappa of Sri Jenukal Siddeshwara Traders said."

The arrival of fresh stock is likely to offer some relief to the people and bridge the huge gap between the demand and supply that has led to fresh rise in prices. Following Thursday's development, onion prices are expected to go down in the next few days.Chakarpur Mandi is city's largest wholesale vegetable/fruit market. From here vegetables and fruits are sold to retailers. According to Chakarpur wholesalers, the fresh stock that arrived on Thursday was not of a good quality.Ram Ratan Uttam, a wholesale merchant at Chakarpur Mandi, told TOI that onion was sold at Rs 55 per kg in the Mandi on Thursday. He added that 27 onion laden trucks from Nasik and Ahmednagar arrived in Chakarpur Mandi but the onion was not of good quality. ""The onion crop has been damaged by heavy rains in Maharashtra. We were waiting for fresh yield but farmers have dispatched onion crop which is not completely ripe. This has happened due to the pressure of rising onion prices in the country,"" he said. Speaking about the increasing prices of potato in the vegetable markets, Uttam said that the new potato crop would arrive only after a month. Currently the potato was being supplied from cold storage. Hence, the quality was not good.When asked about the prices of potato in the wholesale market, the merchant replied that potato was available at Rs 16 a kg and in the retail market it would cost common man between Rs 28 and Rs 32 a kg."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati/Golaghat, Oct. 24: Potato prices in Guwahati soared by over 50 per cent with 35 trucks, each carrying 10 tonnes of potato, stranded at Boxirhat in Bengal. Potato is being sold at Rs 28 per kg  up by Rs 10  in retail markets in Guwahati for the past 15 days. Sources in the state food and civil supplies department today said they had urged Dispur to take up the issue with the Bengal government as traders there were not allowing transport of the consignment fearing local shortage of the commodity. The trucks have been stranded in Bengal for at least 10 days. Traders there are not allowing the trucks to move, as there is a shortage of potatoes across the country. We have written to the food and civil supplies minister, requesting him to take up the matter with the Bengal government. Immediate government intervention is necessary to avoid damage of the commodity, a source said. The supply of the tuber in the country depends mostly on Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Punjab. Prices have gone up in parts of the country because of delay of about a month in arrival of fresh crops from these states. Assam mostly depends on Bengal and Uttar Pradesh for potatoes. Since the consignment from Bengal has been stopped, potato prices are soaring, a source said. Markets in Guwahati decide the prices across Assam and parts of the region as big traders are based in the state capital. The All Assam Students Union today announced a statewide agitation on October 28 and November 1 in protest against Dispurs alleged failure to control prices of essential commodities. AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjya said they would stage demonstrations in front of offices of deputy commissioners in all the districts and submit memoranda, demanding urgent measures to check the price rise. As the impasse over potato supply continued, consumers in Guwahati got a little reprieve over onion prices with the supply department today asking all the 580 fair price shops to sell it at Rs 60 to Rs 62 per kg. Onions prices in Guwahati had touched Rs 90 to Rs 100 per kg. Potato price has also been fixed at Rs 22 per kg in the fair price shops. In the Upper Assam town of Golaghat, traders today came forward to regulate the prices of onion and potato. The United Chamber of Commerce, a traders association, today put up boards in grocery markets, stating the maximum retail price of the two commodities. The chambers president, Dipen Dutta, told The Telegraph that onion prices were found to vary between Rs 75 and Rs 90 in the same market. The initiative brought some succour today with onion price coming down to Rs 68 per kg from Rs 90 per kg yesterday. In a related development, the youth and student wing of the Assam Chamber of Commerce in Guwahati submitted memoranda today to R. Majumdar, the director of the food and civil supplies department, and to Ashutosh Agnihotri, deputy commissioner of Kamrup (metro), demanding measures to check the price rise in the state."

270,Slipping on onion prices,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/slipping-on-onion-prices/article5274213.ece,2013-10-26,The Hindu,"The humble onion is in the news yet again. Prices of the staple vegetable have been rising in recent days across the country, especially in Delhi where it touched Rs.100 a kg on Wednesday. It was only two months ago, in August, that onion prices shot past the Rs.60 a kg mark, forcing the government to take steps to discourage exports while simultaneously arranging to import the bulb from Egypt and China. The government raised the minimum export price first to $650 a tonne and later to $900 a tonne in September when prevailing global prices were less than $500 a tonne, making it virtually impossible for traders to export. That calmed prices down a bit, but they have now rebounded and this is attributed to lower-than-expected harvest due to an extended monsoon that damaged crops in the main producing region in Maharashtra. The State accounts for 30 per cent of onion production in the country. Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma is on record as saying that hoarding by traders is a major reason for the sudden spike in prices. Indeed, it is the price of not just onion but also other staple vegetables such as potato and tomato that has been rising in recent days. Interestingly, the price rise has been the highest in the national capital where elections are just round the corner, bringing back memories of 1998 when the BJP government in Delhi lost power on the issue of rising onion prices.Going by the large differential between wholesale and retail prices  the latter is at least 50 per cent more than the former  there appears to be some merit in the hoarding argument though the original shortage might have been set off by a genuine fall in harvest. Reform of procurement practices and agricultural marketing is long overdue. Given that it is a State subject, the Centre circulated a model of amendments to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act a decade ago, but only a few States have amended the Act  Delhi is not one of them. Among other things, these amendments aimed at reducing the dominance of the wholesaler in the marketing chain. The government needs to act quickly to rein in the price spike in the three staple vegetables, not just because its electoral fortunes are at stake but also because of the negative impact it will have on food inflation. High onion prices were a prime factor in pushing food inflation to 18.4 per cent in September, and going by current indications, the picture may not be very different when the October data come in. The Reserve Bank of India will be watching the trends closely. Given the inflation scenario, it is quite likely that the central bank will be forced to hike rates again, which is not good news for borrowers and the larger economy."

While caterers have begun to compromise on the quantity of onion and shallot used in many dishes, housewives are in search of alternatives.J Manikantan, the proprietor of Omkar catering in Fort, used around 350 kg of onions to prepare delicacies for a dinner party on Thursday. In normal case he had to use 450 kg. The compromise had been made purely because of economical reasons.""As we run catering service, we know that most dishes require onion or shallot as ingredients. We can't use substitutes for onion. The only way is to reduce its quantity,"" Manikantan said. But, even after making the compromise, 50% of Manikantan's profit was eaten away by the high-flying onion price.Homemakers too feel the heat of price rise. ""Earlier, when the price of shallot was high, we used onions and vice-versa. However, now prices of both have shot through the roof. Now, I use one onion when it actually requires two,"" Aida Sulochana, a homemaker, said.Manikantan's mother Rajalakshmi, who helps her son in catering business, said she manages the kitchen by using other vegetables as substitute to onion in dishes such as kuruma. Some homemakers like Srilatha S of Pattoor have already replaced onion with cabbages while preparing curry for breakfast. She says there is no change in taste while using cabbage instead of onion for dishes such as kadala (black chickpea) curry. In some other curries potatoes and even green papaya are used as substitutes.In ayurveda, onion and shallot comes under the category rajasic and tamasic, which means they are not good for body and mind. Onions were not part of the diet of Brahmin and Kshatriya families till recently. Princess Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi of erstwhile Travancore royal family is one among the few who still follows the tradition of satwic diet, which insists on avoiding the use of onion. ""Onions and shallots can be excluded from the curries and still you can have normal vegetarian diet. Try to avoid onion for a week and you can see the prices falling,"" she said. ""New generation is using onion in their diet. However, as per tradition, onion is taboo for us,"" she said.C V Gangadharan, owner of natural health food restaurant 'Pathayam', said onion could not be considered as a food. ""Shallots, bitter gourd, etc. may have medicinal values. Why do you cry when you cut onion, feel bitter when you eat bitter gourd and hot while eating chilly. It is because naturally it is not meant for consumption. There is no need for people to get worried about the rise in onion prices,"" he said."

Power supply has not yet been restored in most of the areas of the city. In the areas where it has been restored, power is provided only for a few hours during night.

The owner of this eatery said this could be done only due to the efforts of the female members of his home who grind the batter for idlis by hand. Because of which he has increased the price of each idli from Rs 2 to Rs 4.Vegetable prices upThe price of vegetables has also increased manifold after the cyclone as most vegetables are being sold at Rs 50 per kilogram or more. As it is the month of Kartik, when most families become vegetarians due to traditional beliefs, potatoes have become the major vegetable in most households. They are adding up soyabean chunks to the dishes.In most middle class households housewives like Pranita Patnaik are compelled to cook only a single curry for the meal which is usually eaten both during lunch and dinner. It is really hard to cook in darkness and without the grinder working only a few dishes can be cooked, she said.Most of the restaurants have stopped allowing customers to sit and eat during night to save cost on running generators and precious water needed to clean the dishes.They are only selling dishes and meals in packets. Several middle class families are preferring to buy curries for their dinner rather than cooking them at home.

""We will be issuing directives to the districts,"" said agricultural marketing minister Arup Roy.State officials argue that excess hoarding of potatoes in the 426 cold storages has led to a spurt in potato prices. The government has thus asked cold storages to release stored potatoes by November 30. It has also imposed a ban on sending potatoes to other states till the price stabilizes.Taking advantage of a good yield last year and the not so well production in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, potato merchants are making a good kill by sending potatoes to places outside Bengal.With lorries loaded with potatoes moving out of the state, stocks in cold storages are depleting fast. The state is now left with 18 lakh metric tonnes of potatoes when the yield was 98 lakh metric tonnes.

Now, due to the surcharge, it has crossed 5 per unit. For a high end consumer whose consumption is 700 units, the rate was 8.24 per unit. Now it is 9.70.Most consumers are not aware of the extra surcharges and think their meters are running fast. Both MSEDCL and SNDL field offices are receiving complaints in this regard. Ritesh Trivedi, a resident of Subhash Nagar, said his bill in summer was just over 850. ""However, this month it is over 1,000. What kind of logic is this? The bill in autumn has to be less than summer,"" he said."
280,India’s weight of the world moment,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/indias-weight-of-the-world-moment/article5283415.ece,2013-10-29,The Hindu,"India has one of the highest burdens of underweight women in the world, with rising obesity levels. Using the World Health Organisation classification based on body mass index, or BMI (the ratio of the weight of the body in kilograms to the square of its height in metres), there were about 31.5 per cent underweight women in the age group 20-49 years in 1998. The share came down to 26.6 per cent in 2005. In contrast, the share of the overweight (including the obese) rose from 13 per cent to 18.2 per cent.Transitional shiftThe coexistence of the underweight and the overweight is often referred to as the double burden of malnutrition. Besides, the burden of overweight (and obesity) is expected to shift to households with lower socio-economic status (SES) as India develops economically. Before a nutritional transition, the overweight and the underweight tend to be concentrated in high and low SES groups, respectively. During the transition, however, the overweight burden shifts to low SES groups, while the underweight burden remains high, exposing them to the double burden.Here we will focus mostly on the ratio of underweight to overweight (including obese) women. While both underweight and overweight are bads, serious concerns have been expressed about an emerging obesity epidemic and, consequently, a growing burden of non-communicable diseases (for example, a likely epidemic of diabetes in India in the near future). So whether this ratio is less than one (more overweight than underweight women) or greater than one (more underweight than overweight women) needs close scrutiny as the health policy implications differ vastly. This analysis is based on a nationally representative survey, the India Human Development Survey, 2005.Women & regional ratiosOur estimates show that at the all-India level, the ratio of underweight to overweight women aged 22-49 was 1.21. So, there were 121 underweight women for 100 overweight women in 2005. In the rural areas, there were more than twice as many underweight women as overweight but a little over a third in the urban areas.The lowest ratio is observed in the southern region and a moderately higher ratio in the northern region, with fewer underweight than overweight women in the former and more underweight than overweight in the latter. The central region had the highest number of underweight women relative to the overweight, followed by the eastern and then the western regions.Out of the 22 States analysed, nine (for example, Punjab, Delhi, Kerala) had fewer underweight women than overweight ones. Punjab had the lowest number of underweight women relative to the overweight, while Kerala had a slightly higher number. In sharp contrast were six States, including Orissa, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, and Madhya Pradesh, where the number of underweight women exceeded substantially that of the overweight. In Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh and Bihar, there were twice as many or more underweight women than the overweight. Orissa stood out as the worst with nearly four times as many underweight women as the overweight.Economic status and casteTo throw light on the relationship between SES and the ratio of underweight to overweight women, we first examine the association between this ratio and per capita monthly expenditure. The higher the expenditure, the lower was the ratio of underweight to overweight women. In the lowest expenditure group, for example, underweight women were over four times as many as the overweight, while in the highest expenditure range they were barely one-third. So there is an inverse association between this ratio and affluence.Another measure of economic status is in terms of assets (for example, motorcycle, car, refrigerator, sewing machine, television, cellphone). The association is similar to that obtained using expenditure. Underweight women were four times as many as the overweight in the lowest asset group, while they were a little over one-fifth of the overweight in the highest asset group. Thus the number of underweight women declines sharply as wealth rises.These monetary measures of economic status are supplemented by caste affiliation. The caste hierarchy manifests itself not just in different levels of economic well-being but also in aspects of social deprivation. Some of the most socio-economically disadvantaged groups comprise the Scheduled Tribes (STs), followed by the Scheduled Castes (SCs), and Other Backward Classes, with the residual group, Others, as the least disadvantaged. The STs are also the socially most excluded group as they are confined largely to remote regions.Underweight women were just under four times the number of the overweight among the STs, and more than twice as many among the SCs. In sharp contrast, underweight women were two-thirds of the overweight among Others. Thus, the socio-economic patterning of the underweight and the overweight was largely intact.Age factorAge matters too. There is an inverse association between the ratio of underweight to overweight women and age-group of women. The ratio was highest in the youngest, aged 22-28, and lowest in the oldest, aged 43-49. In the former, underweight women were three times as many as overweight women but in the latter just two-thirds.The effect of marital status  ever married women  on the ratio of underweight to overweight women was negative in the urban sample but not significant in others. This implies that ever married women were less likely to be underweight but not so generally. Social obligations play an important role, particularly in eating pattern changes upon marriage that help gain weight. Besides, married people smoke less and exercise less, and are thus likelier to be heavy.SanitationSanitation and hygiene (for example, an indoor toilet, a safe drinking water facility and a kitchen with ventilation) are associated with lower ratios of underweight to overweight women as the risks of infectious diseases are lower  especially those acquired by ingesting contaminated food or water, or other exposures in the environment.The risk of overweight/obesity is considerably lower with higher ratios of female-to-male workers, implying that greater opportunities for female employment are associated with greater physical activity and a lowering of the prevalence of overweight among women.Media exposure is linked to more leisure and more frequent eating, and thus a higher risk of being overweight. Other evidence confirms this result but fails to substantiate these links.Diet issuesContrary to assertions that SES is key to the prevalence of underweight and overweight among women, our analysis suggests that the effects of relative food prices through dietary changes are larger. Although we find significant effects of the ratio of cereal to milk and milk product prices, cereal to vegetable prices, and cereal to edible oil prices, the commodity classification is not sufficiently detailed (for example, the nutritional effects of potato and leafy vegetables differ, as also of how they are cooked  boiled or fried). More generally, weight gain seen for specific foods and beverages arises from varying portion sizes, patterns of eating, effects on satiety, or displacement of other foods or beverages. Consumption of starches and refined grains is less satiating, increases hunger signals and total calorie intake, as compared with equivalent calories obtained from less processed food, and higher fibre foods that also contain healthy fats and proteins. Other experimental evidence unravels a relationship between sleep, diet and obesity. Reduced sleep induces preferences for calorie-dense, refined-carbohydrate foods. Weight gain is lowest among persons who sleep six to eight hours a night and is higher among those who sleep less than six hours or more than eight hours.DiseasesThe health implications of being underweight and overweight are grim: underweight women are highly prone to risks of disease, disability and mortality. Besides, children born to them are more likely to be overweight or obese. Overweight and obesity elevate risks of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, hypertension and adult-onset diabetes. However, given the rising burden of NCDs while that of infectious diseases remains high, and as India increases its focus on the health needs of overweight and obese people, it must address simultaneously the needs of the large number of severely undernourished people in society.For Indian women, the pervasiveness of the malnutrition burden is matched only by the grimness of their existence and survival prospects.(Vani S. Kulkarni is research associate, Department of Sociology, Yale University and Veena S. Kulkarni is assistant professor in the Department of Sociology, Criminology and Geography, Arkansas State University. Raghav Gaiha was professor of Public Policy, Faculty of Management Studies, University of Delhi.)As the country develops economically, its double burden of malnutrition and its health implications will increasingly affect women and those who are socio-economically weak"
281,Dispur fails to curb price rise,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131029/jsp/northeast/story_17503351.jsp,2013-10-29,Telegraph,"Guwahati, Oct. 28: In typical knee-jerk reaction to rise in prices of potatoes and onions in Assam markets, the state food and civil supplies department has decided to supply the two commodities at fixed prices through fair price shops. The department, which is often criticised for failing to control prices, has, however, remained short of making a long-term difference because of its lack of legal teeth and insufficient manpower. A senior official of the department said they were unable to force the traders to lower prices of potato and onion as the two items are not included as essential commodities and could not act tough against traders even if they were resorting to unfair means. We can merely request the potato and onion traders to look into the customers interests. But we cant force them to lower prices, as we are not legally mandated to do so. We can register cases against those resorting to unfair means in the supply and trade of essential commodities and forward the cases to courts but we cant do so in case of potato and onion, the official here told The Telegraph. The department is empowered to allot and distribute items under the public distribution system (PDS) and enforce rules relating to trading of essential commodities like LPG and kerosene. Violation of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, may invite legal action, including imprisonment ranging between three months and seven years and fine, depending upon the offences. Assam and for that matter markets in the Northeast depend on Nasik and Bangalore for onion supply and Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Punjab for potato. Traders here control the prices of most of the commodities, including potato and onion as big wholesalers are based here. But they often increase prices of the two commodities citing problem in transportation. The consumer rights organisations, too, complain of illegal syndicates being run by a section of traders who decide prices of the two commodities according to their will. The state government often issues strict instructions for action against the unfair means adopted by traders. The department, however, is unable to do so because of lack of legal teeth. If we force a trader to sell onion and potato at a fixed price, the trader may drag us to court as we do not have legal power. We are also running short of manpower, particularly ground personnel like inspectors, the official said. Unless potatoes and onions are included in the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, we can do very little to control prices. As of now, we are only supplying the two commodities at lower prices through fair price shops as prices of potato and onion have again gone up, the official said. Ajoy Hazarika, chief co-ordinator of Consumer Legal Protection Forum, an NGO here, demanded that the state government should develop a mechanism to control prices of potatoes, onions and other vegetables. Without a proper mechanism to control prices, traders here are increasing vegetable prices according to their will and the supply department is only making knee-jerk reactions, Hazarika said."

One kg of potato is being sold at Rs 24 in the city leaving citizens in a fix.Tomatoes are being sold between Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg depending on the locality. French beans and capsicums have crossed Rs 100 per kilogram mark in the retail market and other common vegetables have also followed suit.""What to purchase and how to purchase"" is the common question raised by women who arrived at Stanely road vegetable market. The rising cost of brinjal too has troubled buyers as it sold at Rs 40 per kg."" This is not for the first time that vegetables prices have soared. In fact, the hike has been quite consistent and every week there has been a considerable rise,"" said a retail vegetable seller, Pappu.Bottle gourd is being sold at Rs 35 per piece while one kg onion is sold at the rate of Rs 70. Besides, prices of other vegetables are on the rise too. Apart from households bearing the brunt of steep price rise, restaurants, and mess facilities too are affected.The residents, however, demanded district authorities to put a check on retailers and initiate fresh measures to check the rise in vegetable prices."
283,Traditional basmati loses out to evolved strains,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/Traditional-basmati-loses-out-to-evolved-strains/articleshow/24898221.cms,2013-10-30,The Times Of India,"AMRITSAR: Considerably higher yields along with high rates have prompted farmers to opt for evolved varieties of basmati like Pusa 1121 and recently-introduced Pusa Punjab 1509 - both with long grain and mild aroma - at the expense of traditional strains like 386, 370, 217 and Dehraduni even in Majha region which is historically known for basmati cultivation. Strong overseas demand has pushed rates of all basmati varieties over Rs 3,500 per quintal this season.With demand for long-grained rice growing in the middle east, Iran, Iraq, Europe and US, more farmers are giving up cultivation of strong-scented traditional varieties of basmati for the high yielding strains. However, traders opine that higher rates of basmati may not last long if its demand drops in the international market, which may lead to losses for farmers, who are bringing more and more area under the crop in the recent years. International rice broker Danial Masih told TOI on Tuesday that ""certain big exporters and traders have created artificial inflation in the market but very soon, the prices of Pusa 1121 and Pusa 1509 will go down given the huge output this year on account of increased acreage"".He said that paddy of Pusa 1121 and Pusa 1509 was being procured from farmers in the range of Rs 3,500-3,700 per quintal, while the retail price of rice was around Rs 90 per kg.Rattan Singh, a farmer, said that traditional basmati was grown in selected areas in Attari, Chogawan and Ajnala besides few other places in Amritsar district but evolved varieties were being widely grown. ""Not only the evolved varieties give better yield, these are of shorter duration so a farmer can take another crop of peas or potatoes along with Pusa 1509, which was not possible with pure basmati,"" he said, adding that the variants had already been sold whereas harvesting of traditional varieties had just started.Arvinderpal Singh Manchanda of Amar Singh Chawalwala firm, which markets famed Lal Quila basmati rice, discounted the possibility of any decline in the price of evolved variants of basmati. He said that market of traditional basmati had shrunk to just 10% due to immense demand of Pusa 1121 and Pusa 1509. He, however, said, ""Pusa 1509 basmati has been cultivated for the first time and gave yield up to 27 quintals per acre but it is suitable for processing as parboiled rice and not for normal milling to be consumed as white rice.""Traditional basmati varieties have an average yield up to eight quintals per acre as against the average of 15-20 quintals per acre for Pusa 1121 and 20-25 quintals for Pusa 1509. Huge difference in yields and marginal variation in rates has pushed farmers to opt for evolved basmati varieties while reducing the area under traditional strains. Traders say both Pusa 1121 and Pusa 1509 have long grains (more than 7mm), which are in great demand in the middle east, Iran and Iraq."

Even as onion rates have settled on the higher side, potato too is witnessing a price rise. The spud is being sold at Rs30 per kg in the retail market. In normal course, the price doesn't go beyond Rs16 to 18 per kg, say traders. Prices have almost doubled when compared to those during same period last year.A brief spell of rains in producing centres like Allahabad, Kanpur and Mainpuri has caused large-scale damage to the crop even before it was ready for harvest. Farmers have now gone for a second round of sowing. As a result, fresh arrivals will reach only by February, which is a month behind the schedule. This has raised the demand for old stock lying in the cold storages. Certain farmers, who could salvage a part of their produce, are holding on to the stock, say market sources.Though the rates had eased a bit in the last couple of days, retail vendors have not passed on the benefit to customers yet. But on the brighter side, market sources say there are a little chances of further hike. However, some traders apprehend a further uptrend in the coming days.On the other hand, onions are still priced at Rs60-70 per kg in retail markets. Though the wholesale rate is Rs45 per kg, traders say a markup of Rs10 per kg by retailers is enough.Jaiprakash Wasani of M/s Pankaj Traders said the wholesale rate of potato is in the range of Rs15 to Rs18 per kg. However, a couple of days ago, it was Rs 20 per kg, but the rate has eased due to increase in supplies. According to Wasani, the rates may remain at this level till January end.However, Ilahi Baksh of Saurashtra Trading said there are chances potato prices may go up if the new crop is further delayed. According to Baksh, wholesale rates are 20% more than those during last year.Mohammed Afzal of M/s Afzal Trading Company discounted the rate hike theories. ""Such fluctuations are usual. The prices would come down by the month end after supplies from Punjab reach Nagpur. Even the current wholesale rates are not more than Rs15 per kg,"" he said. Another trader Rawaldas Motwani too said that the rates are in the normal range or Rs12 to Rs16 per kg.Kailash Babu, a consignment agent in Kanpur, said though it is usual for rates to spurt during this season, but the current levels are unprecedented. At Kanpur, the rate is Rs1500 a quintal (Rs15 per kg). ""This is a jump of Rs300 which happened in just over a fortnight,"" he said while rejecting chances of a further hike."
287,Rs 13 potato ceiling but price pot boils,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131101/jsp/calcutta/story_17518797.jsp,2013-11-01,Telegraph,"Mamata Banerjee on Thursday pegged the price of potato in retail markets across Calcutta at Rs 13 a kilo after a meeting with the task force that monitors prices of essential commodities. Agricultural marketing minister Arup Roy and other Trinamul leaders were prompt in terming the chief ministers announcement a reflection of her concern over rising prices and the problems homemakers were facing in balancing household budgets. Mamata has on several occasions given her government the credit of being the only one that keeps tabs on the prices of essential items. While any attempt to rein in prices will make people happy, some key issues get lost in the euphoria. Metro explains the economics of price rise and efficacy of price control. Surplus state Bengal, with around 18 lakh hectares under potato cultivation, is a surplus state with demand always lagging behind supply (see chart). The price of potato across the state has been between Rs 6 and Rs 8 a kilo over the past few years, except in 2009 when bad weather resulted in a production slump and the price soared to Rs 22 a kg. Sources in the agriculture marketing department said over 18 lakh tonnes of potato were in cold storage and the stock was sufficient to last till January, when a fresh crop arrives. Monthly demand of potato is around 5 lakh tonnes, which means there is no short supply, an official said. Supply chain Middlemen procure the produce  primarily from Hooghly, West Midnapore and Burdwan  and release it to the wholesale market, depending on demand. Wholesalers sell the produce to retailers. The state government blames middlemen for the price rise. Some unscrupulous middlemen have pushed up the price But we will not allow it, Mamata said, fixing prices for different stages of the chain. Stock shock Government officials and potato traders revealed two reasons for the price rise. The extension of the deadline to empty out cold storage facilities last year deviated from the practice of mandatory stock clearance by November 30 to prepare for the arrival of the new crop. The government had extended the deadline till December 31. Middlemen are holding on to their stock this year in anticipation of another extension that would help them release potatoes slowly till the end of the year instead of by November 30, in which case there would be a glut in the market and a fall in price. The subsidy on export that was offered last year is another reason for the current price rise. Traders are holding on to their stock in the hope of benefiting from an export subsidy again. Price ceiling Any ceiling on the price of an item has failed to yield the desired result so far as the government doesnt have any control over production and the supply chain. This was evident last week when the agricultural marketing minister declared that potato would not be sold at above Rs 14 a kilo. The result? Potato price shot up to Rs 18 a kilo from Rs 16/kg. On October 31, potato was priced Rs 20 a kilo at Maniktala market. Task force The task force comprising representatives of the police, enforcement directorate, CMC and the agricultural marketing department has had little impact on prices of essential items in the long run. It has been observed that prices tend to drop when chief minister Mamata talks about taking action against unfair pricing, only for the problem to resurface. The government has not taken action against any hoarder or unscrupulous middleman till now, an official said. And finally Potato price isnt the only dent on the homemakers budget; prices of almost all vegetables have spiralled I dont know whether the ceiling on potato price will work or not I would have liked some strong action to tame the prices of other products that are pinching us much more, said a homemaker from Salt Lake.

She announced a retail and wholesale price for potatoes.The city polices enforcement directorate along with the West Bengal police and the members of the task force set up by her government to monitor prices of essential commodities in different markets would monitor any inflation in prices.Ever since her government came to power, it had taken efforts to make the State self sufficient in the supply of vegetables and fish, Ms. Banerjee told journalists at the new State Secretariat in Mandir Bazar in Howrah district.We have to bring the seeds for cultivating potato from other States. We have decided to develop the seeds in the State  For the supply of onions, we are also are dependent on other States and we are trying to achieve self sufficiency, she said.As over five lakh metric tons of onions are required in West Bengal, the State has to arrange for about two lakh metric tons from other States, Ms. Banerjee said, adding that an additional 30,000 metric tons of onions were cultivated this year in Bankura district.She said that until the prices of vegetables in markets stabilised, the government would not allow the produce to be sold in other States.Ms. Banerjee also fixed the prices of potatoes at Rs. 13 per kg in retail markets and Rs. 11 per kg in wholesale markets. To meet the demand of fish, fish would be cultivated in 350 ponds brought under the purview of the Agriculture Department, she said."

""Supply will be affected to the seven sister states,"" an official said.Veggie prices are spiraling out of control in Bengal despite the state government's setting up fair-price shops and threatening hoarders with prosecution. Brinjal is selling at Rs 80, onion at Rs 70 and tomato at Rs 60 in Kolkata.Capsicum and bean have climbed past the century mark. On Thursday, the CM called a meeting with agriculture minister Moloy Ghatak, agriculture marketing minister Arup Roy, horticulture minister Subrata Saha, chief secretary Sanjay Mitra, home secretary Basudeb Banerjee and Kolkata police commissioner Surajit Kar Purkayastha.Mamata said that traders are diverting produce to flood-hit states for higher profits. Potato, for instance, is selling for Rs 50 a kilo in Bhubaneswar while it's going for Rs 13 in Kolkata. The CM said that the state government is ""aggrieved"" by the sudden price rise and blamed middlemen for ""stocking vegetables and potato"". Police will start raiding markets from Friday to keep tabs on prices, she said. ""Trucks loaded with potatoes and vegetables will not be allowed to ply out of Bengal until the price stabilizes here,"" the CM said.Mayoral council member for markets, Tarak Singh, said they will display the government-approved MRP of vegetables in markets so that customers aren't cheated.Mamata warned that FIRs will be lodged against traders who do not sell potato at Rs 13 in the retail market and Rs 11 in the wholesale market. ""The decision had been taken jointly by the state government and traders. Leaflets will be distributed in all markets with the signatures of the traders' representatives and government officials,"" she said.Trinamool is not against traders, she said, pointing out that they were only party to walk out of the UPA-II government on the FDI issue to protect the interest of traders. ""But we will take action against those who fleece the common man,"" she warned. ""We do not control prices of agri-products in individual markets. The sellers decide it. But we need to act tough because prices are rising since vegetables are not reaching the markets,"" Mamata said.The fisheries department has started rearing fish in 350 tanks to control rising fish prices. Fish-loving Bengal is dependent on Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh but it's getting costlier because of rising transportation cost. ""We have also started a hilsa research centre, which help lower its price,"" the CM said. The government has started growing onion in Bankura, to cut down its dependence on Nasik. ""We have started growing 30,000 metric tonnes of onions and a third of it will be sent immediately to the markets,"" she said."

States need to show greater initiative,"" he told a news conference, adding that the Centre can use food stocks to moderate prices of grains and pointed to the initiative taken by the government .Food inflation has hovered at 18%, with onion prices sky-rocketing to over Rs 100 a kg in certain markets such as Congress-ruled Delhi. The government has repeatedly taken the plea that it can do little to control vegetable prices. In the recent flare-up in onion prices, states were blamed for not monitoring the supply. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has ring-fenced the supply of potatoes from her state, leading to spiraling prices in some areas. The government has also blamed hoarded for the sharp spike in onion prices.Although union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and food minister K V Thomas have not refrained from repeatedly predicting a fall in onion prices, only to get it wrong, Chidambaram refused to make such forecasts. He said that steps taken by the government to repair the fiscal deficit will help check inflationary expectations in the economy.With little success in controlling vegetable prices, Chidambaram sought to hard sell the initiative to moderate wheat prices, which have remained high despite the government stashing the grain in warehouses."

""If Mamata can think about her state and restrict the export of essential commodities, why can't Gogoi also take some steps to improve the situation? The incapability of state food and civil supplies minister Nazrul Islam has worsened the situation,"" said Aasu president Sankar Prasad Roy.Potatoes are being sold at Rs 35-40 per kg, while onions are being sold at Rs 80-90 per kg in the state. Traders say that in the last two days, prices have gone up by 30 to 50 per cent and the halt in export from West Bengal may further aggravate the crisis.According to Kamrup Chamber of Commerce (KCC), though Assam imports onions from other parts of the country, huge quantities of potatoes come from West Bengal. KCC president Mahavir Jain said, ""We believe the West Bengal government would at least allow trucks carrying potatoes from other states to pass through West Bengal to reach Assam and the region."""

Potato prices, which caught an upward trend with the influx of new potatoes in Ranchi market, have gone through the roof with one kg of potato being sold for Rs 25-30 in the retail market on Friday.The potato crisis in Ranchi and other northeastern states is learnt to have emerged from restrictions on its sale to other states by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. While the retailers are unaware of why the prices are going up, some wholesalers are trying to understand the real story.""There has been a sudden fall in the potato supply to our market. This deficit is natural to an extent but largely manmade,"" said Mohammad Naim of Daily market, who owns a retail as well as a wholesale shop. Another trader of Pandra Krishi Bazar samity, Raju Verma, echoed similar sentiments. He said in October and November, prices usually come down as new produce hits the market. ""The demand for potato rises because by the end of the kharif season, there is an acute shortage of green vegetables in the market. But this year even potatoes have gone out of reach of the common man,"" he said.While the old variant of potato was priced at Rs 20 per kg in Ranchi, the new variant is being sold at Rs 30 per kg. The prices in northeastern states like Assam have touched Rs 45-50 per kg and is not likely to come down anytime soon.""In some of the potato-producing states, the untimely rains affected crops adversely as a result of which farmers have gone for a second round of sowing. Once this crop starts coming into the market from February, prices will come down,"" said Verma.Agriculture experts believe that potatoes from Meghalaya and Punjab would start coming by third week of November and help bring down the prices in local market. ""Jharkhand farmers also grow potatoes, which is enough to meet the local demand. But this year, Cyclone Phailin preceded by a long dry spell, damaged the crops,"" said Diwan Sharma an agriculturist working with the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK)."

He accused the government of failing to take required action even as the common man in Delhi continues to suffer from price rise and corruption.Indifferent attitude of the government has broken the back of the people of Delhi. Not a single house is unaffected by price rise and adulteration and the government machinery remains a spectator, he said in a statement. Pointing to the host of household goods that have seen a hike in prices, Dr. Vardhan said: Cooking gas cylinders are being openly sold from Rs.1,200 to Rs.1,400 in black market. People have been suffering due to unprecedented rise in the price of onion. And now vegetable traders have made potatoes, tomatoes, brinjals, green vegetables, mushrooms and garlic costly.He alleged that the market was full of adulterated sweets but the government had not raided a single shop. Further, he said tomatoes, which were being sold at Rs.40 per kg till very recently, are now being sold at Rs 60 to 70.Just three days ago, potatoes were being sold at Rs.25 per kg now these were being sold at Rs. 40 to 50 per kg, apples are being sold at Rs.70 to 140 per kg, bananas at Rs.70 per dozen, pomegranate at Rs. 140 per kg. and pineapples at Rs. 100 per piece, he added.High inflation has dampened the festive spirit, he claimed adding even price of small statues of Lord Ganesha and Laxmi was about Rs.300 in the market. An average family is unable to perform the worship of Lord Ganesha and Laxmi happily. The price of decorative materials, lighting, candles, colourful lanterns, earthen lamps is sky rocketing. Small earthen lamps cost Rs.15 per dozen, he said.Dr. Vardhan said that even purchasing dry fruits has become a dream with almonds being sold from Rs 800 to Rs.1,000 per kg, walnuts at Rs.1,400 per kg, raisins at Rs.800 per kg, cashew from Rs.1,000 to 1,400 per kg and pistachios at Rs 2,200 per kg."

According to wholesale traders of Muhana Mandi, there has been a rise of 35% to 40% in the prices of tomato and it will come down only after the arrival of fresh stock a week after Diwali.The rise in prices is attributed to disruption in supplies in northern parts including Rajasthan due to extended monsoon which affected the crops and also hoarding.Since the first week of October, price of tomatoes have risen by nearly 35% to 40% at the local Muhana Mandi.""In September, the wholesale price of tomato was varying from Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg which was nearly Rs 25 to Rs 35 in the retail.

Hence, with an inadequate supply in the state's markets, the average consumer managed to procure potato at anything between Rs 14 and 17 on Saturday, way above the Rs 13 fixed by Mamata.Moreover, potatoes were not available at many rural markets in Hooghly and Bankura. Cold storages were closed on Saturday, so it was not possible to ascertain the quantity of potato reached the market.Potato dealers and farmers termed the state's price fixation unrealistic and said the government's potato policy reflects ground reality. Potato dealers said the new crop is expected to hit the markets soon and the old crop will start rotting in cold storages unless the ban on selling potatoes beyond the state's borders is lifted.Farmers with stock remaining in cold storages are angry too. They say the cost of production of potato this season was Rs 15,000 every bigha. ""Owing to excess production, we were forced to resort to distress sale and even the cost of production could not be recovered,"" say farmers in Hooghly, the state's potato bowl. These farmers question why sale of potatoes outside the state should be restricted. ""Is potato farming a crime like dacoity and murder that we see police swooping down on truckloads of our crop,"" said Ratan Das, a farmer in Pursura, Hooghly.Saturday's wholesale price of potato at major markets in the state ranged between Rs 560 and Rs 580 for every packet weighing 50 kg. The trend could be observed was witnessed in the wholesale potato markets of Singur's Ratanpur, Tarakeswar's Chapadanga, Bankura's Kotulpur, West Midnapore's Chandrakona and Burdwan's Kalna. Farmers wondered how potato would sell at Rs 13 a kg in retail markets in situation where the wholesale price is as high as Rs 12.50 a kg in some markets.Further justifying their call to lift the ban on export of potato, farmers and traders alike said the potatoes sent to Bihar and Jharkhand in particular is of far inferior quality than potatoes sold in Kolkata where small or kent sized potatoes are in demand.Experts also held the weather responsible for the delay in the new crop hitting the market. ""Heavy rain till even last week delayed the new crop by a month. Normally, the new crop reaches the market by now,"" said Pradyut Das, an expert. Farmers in Bengal along with those in UP's Kanauj and Punjab's Jalandhar sow two crops in the same season, he added. ""The delay in the new crop's arrival has triggered the scarcity,"" added Das.Decrying the state's directive to clear the old crop from cold storages by November end, farmers said with the new crop yet to arrive, the state should give them an extension till mid-December to sell old crop.Kotulpur marginal farmer Shyamal Das rued that potato farming in the state involves a swing between joy and tears from year to year.Lalu Mukherjee, president of Pragatishil Aloo Byabasayi Samity, said presently the 416 cold storages in the state together store 17 lakh metric tones of potatoes. Of this, 6 lakh metric tones will be in demand in state markets till the end of December, while 4 lakh metric tones have been kept for plantation for the next season. ""So, some 7 lakh metric tonnes of potatoes will rot in cold storages unless the state sees the reality,"" Mukherjee said.Rejecting Mukherjee's contention, minister of state for agriculture Becharam Manna said, ""Some time back, farmers told me that they were not even selling their crops at Rs 5 per kg. Then, 50 kg packets were sold for Rs 260, while the present price is around Rs 550. Our decision is based on reality."""

The activity goes on in broad daylight and increases at night. Private buses depart from Strand Road with sacks of potatoes on top.These buses are bound for Bihar and Jharkhand and cross the border via Singur, Maheswarpur, Burdwan's Masagram and Jamalpur areas. Whole-sellers, on the other hand, prefer the Durgapur expressway to smuggle potatoes. Police have failed to check their activities.The chief minister had also ordered a crackdown on potato retailers who sell their products above the government rate of Rs 13 a kilogram. However, this has created a dilemma for traders. As the potato prices are very high across the country, traders are facing losses.According to traders, they will face more losses if they start selling potatoes below the rate of Rs 13 per kilogram. In such a situation where the police are pulling them up for selling potatoes above the rate fixed by the government, potato traders are not willing to bring their products from the cold storage to the markets.The price of potato could also not be controlled in the districts. Whereas a 50 kilogram sack of potato was being sold for Rs 580 on Saturday, on Sunday it was getting sold at Rs 600 to Rs 675.Chandramukhi and Jyoti varieties of potatoes for several markets in the city and adjacent areas are mostly supplied from Hooghly district.Lalu Mukherjee of the 'Progotisil Aloo Babosayi Samity' said that they were planning to request the state government to relax the rules on exporting potatoes.""There are 417 cold storages where almost six to seven lakh tonnes of potatoes are being stored. These potatoes will rot if not utilized by the month of December. Till this year, traders have been selling potatoes to other states. Why did the government come up with the ban this time?"" he asked.Hooghly district magistrate Manmeet Nanda and SP Sunil Chowdhury said that they were constantly monitoring the situation. ""Five cases have been registered and we are keeping a tab on almost all retail and wholesale markets,"" they said."

Although the government has stuck to its claim of doing everything possible to mitigate the crisis, buyers had to shell out between Rs 20 and Rs 24 today to purchase the Chandramukhi potato in Calcutta markets, much higher than the Rs 13 pegged by Mamata Banerjee and between Rs 8 and Rs 11 during the last quarter of 2012. The Jyoti variety is not available in the market. So we are being forced to purchase the costlier Chandramukhi, said homemaker Deblina Roy at Maniktala market. The situation was similar elsewhere in the state, with consumers wondering why prices remained steep despite assurances from the government, administrative monitoring and arrests of wholesalers. Be it Jyoti or Chandramukhi, the supply has been severely affected, which in turn is pushing up prices. The chief ministers assurances have not trickled down to the grassroots, said Rampurhat-based wholesaler Vijay Jaiswal. In Birbhums Rampurhat, retailers stopped selling potato today because the administration was forcing them to charge Rs 13 a kilo. In Hooghlys Mogra, police seized 200kg of potato each from two wholesalers following complaints that they were charging high prices. Twenty-five wholesalers were arrested in West Midnapore. Wholesalers attributed the artificial scarcity of potato in the markets to a three-day strike organised by the West Bengal Progressive Potato Merchants Association, the largest umbrella organisation of potato traders, since Saturday. This year, the state has produced a surplus of 30 lakh tonnes of potato, a big part of which is still in cold storages because traders protesting the price ceiling and a government ban on sale to other states have refused to take them out. Around 18 lakh tonnes of potato are being stored in the 500-odd cold storages in the state. From tomorrow, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation plans to sell 4,000kg of potato at Rs 11 a kg to retailers in city markets. They will have to sell the consignment to consumers at Rs 13 a kilo. We hope to implement the plan by Tuesday morning, said Khalil Ahmed, the CMC commissioner. Agri-marketing minister Arup Roy refuted the retailer lobbys claim that potato was not available at the wholesale rate of Rs 11. If any retailer faces a problem, he can come to our Sakher Bazar godown and procure potato. We will give it to them at Rs 10.50 a kilo, he said. The government sold Jyoti potato at Rs 13 a kilo from outlets in 12 markets in Calcutta and Howrah today. Minister Roy, who oversaw the sale of 1,000kg of potato at Howrahs Shibpur market today, said the government was doing everything possible to monitor and regularise the price of the tuber and the situation was expected to become normal within days. Setting a ceiling on the price of potato has failed to yield results as the government doesnt have control over production and the supply chain."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Nov. 4: What Phailin could not do to the potato price, a restriction by the Bengal government has done. Potato prices have reached Rs 30 a kilogram at retail outlets across the city since last evening. Annual production of the tuber in the state is 1.75 lakh to 1.8 lakh tonnes against the annual demand of five lakh tonnes. The rest comes from Bengal. It, therefore, becomes a burden on the people whenever any restriction or transportation problem arises. Traders attributed the rise to the restrictions imposed by the Bengal government to have sufficient stocks for their internal supply. But, an official of the civil supplies department said talks with their Bengal counterparts were on and a 40 truckload of potatoes will reach the city tomorrow. The states civil supplies secretary Madhusudan Padhi said: The Bengal government has introduced a centralised permit system through which the potato traders have to apply for permit in Calcutta to transport potatoes to Odisha. We are taking up the matter with the Bengal government to ease the situation. Padhi, however, said 49 truckload of potatoes have reached Bhubaneswar today as against 25 truckload on daily basis. Pokhariput resident Pitambar Parida said: Yesterday, as the wholesale price at Unit-I was Rs 25 a kilogram, the price in retail outlets reached Rs 30-a-kg. The tuber was selling at Rs 12-a-kg just before Phailin attack, but panic buying created problem and the price reached Rs 20 for two to three days. After a week of the cyclone, the price again came to Rs 12-a-kg. Last week, the rate reached Rs 20-a-kg as the supply started receding from Bengal. Yesterday, the retail price at Unit-I market reached Rs 25-a-kg. President of the Unit-I Daily Market Traders Association Gayadhar Swain said: The situation has resulted because of short supply. The state government should take steps to bring in more potatoes from Bengal. While the city and its outskirts need around 30 truckload of potatoes a day, the supply has come to 10 or 12 truckload. As there is less stock in the godowns, such deficit has arisen in the market leading to the price hike, said an official. In Cuttack, one kilogram of potato is being sold at between Rs 27 to Rs 30 at the retail market in the city. An official of the Chhatrabazar Byabasaik Sangha blamed on short supply from Bengal for the potato price hike. Secretary of the traders association Devendra Sahu said that earlier everyday around 12 to 15 truckload of potatoes reached Chhatrabazar, while the supply has been restricted to only three truckload of potatoes a day now."

This has put people, who prefer vegetarian food in the auspicious month of Kartik, in severe inconvenience. We cannot have non-vegetarian food during the holy month of Kartik. But the vegetable prices have been too high for past two weeks, making it very difficult for us to prepare vegetarian items. To add to our woes, the rate of the most popular vegetable, potato, has also gone up. It has almost doubled in one week. It hurts us a lot, said Smitarani Behera, a homemaker in Palasuni. Potato prices have been fluctuating for the past one month. While panic of consumers created artificial shortage and subsequent price hike of vegetables during cyclone. Later, the rate came down to Rs 10 to Rs 12 a kg. However, the flood triggered by torrential rain put pushed the vegetable prices again. Earlier, we used to skip many vegetables because of the high prices. But now, we are forced to buy only potato. I get confused everyday about what to cook for lunch or dinner. It has caused a headache as we have reduced the number of dishes in the holy month of Kartik, said Alibha Singh, a homemaker. The price rise has not only affected the kitchens at home, but also the various hotels and restaurants in the city. The hotel and restaurant owners are forced to either raise the rate of the items or reduce quantity. People argue with us for rise in price of our dishes. But, we are helpless as the price rise affects us badly. The government should take some steps to put a check on the uncontrolled rise in vegetable price, said Krupasindhu Bhoi, a roadside eatery owner. Even vendors selling gupchup, alu chop and alu dum, who depend heavily on potato, have also reduced the quantity of their items owing to the price rise. Officials of the civil supplies department today visited various godowns and stock centres of potato and other vegetables to check hoarding. They checked the quantity of stocks, rate of potato and ensured that the rate did not go up further. We visited these godowns to ensure that the prices will not rise. We instructed the traders in this regard, said Pravakar Rout, deputy director of civil supplies department. Sources said that 350 to 400 truckloads of potato come to the state from Bengal every day. But the Bengal government has put restriction on the supply, making it mandatory for traders to obtain permits for transporting potato to their state, which takes five to six days. Many trucks have been detained on the inter-state borders because of this. Though around 25 truckloads of potato are needed daily for Bhubaneswar and its surrounding areas, only 8 trucks have arrived today."

And this 'Chhath' is no exception. As if the increased petroleum prices and onion price were not enough to dampen the festive spirit, prices of vegetables have literary doubled this weekend.Since non-veg is a strict no-no in most of the Hindu families during 'Chhath', vegetables are in low supply and high demand. Even potato is pinching the pocket as during the last three-four days, its price has increased steadily.Prices of other green vegetables went north on Tuesday, on the eve of 'Nahai Khai', as bottle gourd, popularly known as 'doodhi' or 'lauki' was sold at Rs 70-80 per kg. The gourd, an indispensable item for the worshippers of Sun God, who start the Chhath rituals with 'kaddu-bhat', is fast disappearing from the vegetable marts.""Many of our crops were destroyed in the October rain. Hence, we are forced to sell it at such high price,"" said a vegetable seller Awdhesh at Rajiv Nagar.Even the prices of cucumber, cauliflower, brinjal, tomatoes and pointed gourd have almost doubled. While cucumber is selling at Rs 60 per kg, cauliflower, brinjal and tomatoes were being also sold at over Rs 50 to 60 per kg.The potato crisis is reportedly because of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee restricting its export to other states. ""There has been a sudden fall in the potato supply to our market. This deficit is largely manmade,"" said Ansur Naim, a wholesale shopowner at Boring Road market. Another trader of Krishi Bazaar Samiti, Raju, echoed similar sentiment. In November, prices usually come down as new produce hits the market, but this year the situation is unusual, he said.However, deputy director, horticulture, Nitesh Kumar Rai told TOI, ""This situation will prevail for another 20-25 days. Soon the new crop of potato from Himachal, Meghalaya and other states will be available in the market and prices will automatically come down. Moreover, Nalanda potatoes will be also ready in December. Incidentally, by the end of kharif season, there is an acute shortage of green vegetables in the market leading to rise in potato price. This gap between demand and supply has further added to the woes of consumers."""
308,"Rocket, not to Mars but in pockets",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131106/jsp/bengal/story_17535365.jsp,2013-11-06,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Nov. 5: Vegetable prices have rocketed up to 175 per cent this Bhai Phonta compared with their rates during the festive season last year. While the prices of onion have doubled in the past 12 months, those of brinjal have almost trebled. Although prices tend to move northwards during the festive season  from Durga Puja to Chhat  because of a spurt in demand, sources in the agricultural marketing department termed this years escalation unprecedented. In an attempt by The Telegraph to capture the extent of price rise, the rates of a select set of vegetables from various Calcutta markets were considered over the past two days and were compared with the prices last year. The prices of most vegetables were found to have shot up by 80 per cent on average. (See chart) I spent Rs 310 on vegetables today. This is the highest I have paid in recent times . Something must be wrong, said Sreemoyee Banerjee in Salt Lakes CA market today. The chief minister has of late criticised the Centre for failing to contain price rise. Mamata Banerjee had set up a task force to keep prices of essential commodities in the state in check. She had said her government was the only one to have set up such a team. But the prevailing vegetable prices suggest the task force has failed. A member of the task force attributed the price rise to untimely rain and the recent floods in the two Midnapores, Howrah and Hooghly, which affected crops across hectares. Till a few days ago, there was hardly any harvest in the villages because of heavy rain. The supply dropped, the demand kept rising. The severe mismatch pushed up vegetable prices, he added. Another official said hoarding by a section of traders, who form the supply chain between the farmer and the retailer, was also responsible for the price rise. Middlemen  known as phore in markets  operate in almost all sectors. They play a key role in the supply chain, which makes them eligible for gains from the trade. According to an official of the agricultural marketing department, the activism of the task force is limited to Calcutta markets. But the hoarding usually takes place midway, between the supply of vegetables from the districts and the markets. Lack of preparation in handling a sudden shortfall  as had happened in the case of potato  is another reason for the spiralling prices, the official said. During the Left rule, the government used to buy 12 per cent of the total potatoes in cold storages . Given the annual production in the range of 90 to 100 lakh tonnes, this would have meant around 10-12 lakh tonnes with the government. A sudden shortfall could have been handled with this, he added. The Left government also had an agreement with other potato producers like Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to bail out Bengal during the festive season. In 2009, Bengal bought 10,000 tonnes of the tuber from Punjab. The government yesterday had promised to provide potatoes at Rs 11 a kg to retailers in 20 Calcutta markets to be sold to consumers at Rs 13. But the potatoes arrived so late, the retailers had left by then. The Jyoti variety was not available while the Chandramukhi sold at Rs 24 a kilo."

It is being sold at Rs 30 a kg in the city.Meanwhile, the food supplies and consumer welfare (FSCW) department conducted raids on different markets here to check the stock and control prices. The vendors have been asked to sell potato at Rs 25 and onion at Rs 45 a kg instead of Rs 30 and Rs 50 a kg respectively.""Raids are being conducted to check hoarding. Action will be initiated against vendors, who are found selling potatoes at more than Rs 25 a kg,"" said deputy director of FSCW department Prabhakar Rout.Traders said there was an acute shortage of potato in the market, leading to 100% rise in the price. ""Earlier Unit-I marker received around 25 truckloads of potatoes every day, but on Tuesday only nine trucks came in with the vegetable,"" said Karunakar Behera, a trader.According to state horticulture department, the state consumes around 9.21 lakh metric tonne potatoes a year as against the annual production of 2.1 lakh metric tonne. Major potato growing districts in the state are Kandhamal, Puri, Cuttack, Balasore and Sambalpur. The state largely depends on West Bengal for the tuber.""Odisha's climate and soil conditions are not suitable for potato cultivation. We harvest only 13.57 metric tonne a hectare against the national productivity of 21.8 metric tonne a hectare. We are trying to increase the yield this year by sowing 21,000 quintal more seeds, but it will not make us self-sufficient. We also have to focus on storage facility and market linkage,"" said horticulture officer Susant Das.Ganjam district administration on Tuesday requested the state government to supply at least five truckloads of potatoes to tide over the present crisis. ""The wholesale market will exhaust its stock in the next two days,"" sub-collector (Berhampur) B K Das said."
310,Potatoes for Rs 13 but rotten,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131106/jsp/siliguri/story_17533656.jsp,2013-11-06,Telegraph,"(Left) A basket of gnarled potatoes that cost Rs 13 a kg in Siliguri, and another basket of the spuds that cost Rs 30 a kg. Pictures by Kundan Yolmo Nov. 5: Several rotten spuds will fall into the bag if you want potato at Rs 13 a kg in Siliguri. The green grocer will not let you take your pick. Depending on the price, you get a chance to pick and choose potatoes. If anyone is buying the tero takar alu, or potatoes selling at Rs 13, the buyer wont get the option of choosing. He will have to accept whatever the seller gives him after weighing, said Anjan Sarkar, a resident of Siliguri. If you buy the newly harvested potatoes of north Bengal or those brought in from Bhutan, which are being at Rs 30-35 a kg, you have the right to choose, the bank employee said. Ever since shortage of potatoes was reported across the state, with north Bengal being an exception, a number of initiatives has been taken by the district administrations to ensure that people get potatoes at Rs 13 a kg, fixed by the government. The wholesale price has been fixed at Rs 11 a kg. The reality, however, is different. Potatoes sold at that price (Rs 13 a kg) are available only in a few outlets, unlike the way it is sold at all municipal markets across Calcutta, Dhiren Lama, a Jalpaiguri resident said. Here, it is mostly the regulated markets, most of which are on the outskirts, he added. In retail markets, potatoes are hardly available against the fixed price. Most traders are selling newly harvested potatoes, that too at a higher rate like Rs 30 or so a kg. They are saying potatoes harvested earlier and kept in cold storages were not available and for that reason, they are not being able to sell them at the rate fixed by the state, Lama said. In Malda, too, the scene is the same. Only a few shops are selling potatoes at Rs 13 a kg but you cannot choose. If you can pay Rs 18 or Rs 20 a kg, you can choose the potatoes, said Ratan Saha, a Malda resident. Malda district magistrate G. Kirankumar has convened a meeting with cold storage owners and potato merchants to know about the stock. The idea is to tide over the crisis and get stored potatoes into the market so that people get them at the fixed rate of Rs 13 a kg. We are keeping a watch to see that potatoes are not sold at higher prices, he said. Retail vegetable sellers have devised a strategy. They are keeping potatoes at the rate of Rs 13 a kg, which are mostly rotten or damaged, and beside that they are displaying the good spuds and selling those at higher rates, said Nisith Das, a schoolteacher in Raiganj. Today in Dhupguri, the district agricultural marketing department of Jalpaiguri and representatives of the local vegetable vendors association sold potatoes at Rs 13 a kg from a counter at the regulated market. We will sell around 5.5 quintal at Rs 13 a kg. The sale would continue for a week and would be held in places like Malbazar and Jalpaiguri, Subrata Dey, the district agricultural marketing officer of Jalpaiguri said. We had taken a similar initiative in Alipurduar and we would ensure that the maximum portion of stored potatoes is sold at the fixed price."

It is selling two varieties of potatoes at Rs 24 and Rs 44 per kg.However, local vendors are charging Rs 70-80 per kg for tomatoes and Rs 60-70 per kg for onions.As per the government data, tomato was being sold at Rs 70 per kg in Kanpur, Dehradun and Aizwal. It was cheapest at Rs 20 per kg in Puducherry and Thiruchirapalli. The average rate for 57 cities stood at Rs 40 per kg.Traders at Delhi's Aazdpur wholesale mandi attributed the rise in tomato prices to lower supplies from Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh and major producing regions in Maharashtra.The arrival of tomatoes have almost stopped from Himachal Pradesh with the onset of winter season, they added.Arrival of tomatoes has declined by almost half in the national capital as compared to supplies before Diwali, mainly due to festive season and extended monsoon, traders said.Among green vegetables, capsicums are selling at maximum Rs 89 per kg at Mother Dairy's Safal outlets, followed by beans at Rs 76 per kg and colocasia (arbi) at Rs 64 per kg.Bottle gourds are being sold at Rs 38 per kg, ladyfinger (okra) Rs 54 per kg, cauliflower Rs 52 per kg and cabbage Rs 44 per kg."

From Shyambazar in the north to Behala in the southern fringes, potatoes were sold through fair price shops. With people queuing up in large numbers at these markets since early morning, potatoes were sold out in most places by noon, said a civic official.A section of buyers, however, was not happy with the quality of potatoes being sold at a subsidized rate in the municipal markets. ""I went to Behala Shakuntala Market with the expectation that I would get potatoes of good quality at a reasonable rate. All I got was potatoes of inferior quality,"" grumbled Manab Mukerjee, a Behala resident.However, the government's bounty - which comprised only three truckloads - largely failed to solve the severe crisis of potatoes across the city. In most markets, buyers were forced to buy potatoes at Rs 18 a kilo. In some markets like Bansdroni, Chetla and Ramlalbazar (Jadavpur) in the south and Cossipore, Chittaranjan Avenue and Bidhan Sarani in the north, the stock of potatoes ran dry, leaving buyers with no option but to search for the 'precious' vegetable in other markets or buy it at a premium.Tarak Singh, the member, mayor-in-council, overseeing the KMC market department, conceded that though the KMC had tried to fill the gap of supply and demand of potatoes in the city, the supply was far from satisfactory. ""We are trying to narrow the gap by supplying more truckloads of potatoes from Wednesday,"" Singh said. The state agriculture marketing department is supplying the civic body with potatoes at Rs 11 a kilo.As planned on Monday, three trucks loaded with potatoes did the rounds of all major municipal markets like Manicktala, Shyambazar, College Street in the north and Entally, Park Circus, Lake, Lansdowne, Sakherbazar and Jadavpur in the south. Traders were sold potato at Rs 11 a kilo and were asked to sell it for Rs 13 a kilo. Singh and municipal commissioner Khalil Ahmed made surprise visits to these markets to check whether the traders were selling potatoes at the price fixed by the civic body under instructions from chief minister Mamata Banerjee to take on a section of dishonest traders and hoarders who have been responsible for the rise in the price of potato.According to a senior official of the KMC market department, the civic body on Tuesday distributed potatoes to 12 municipal markets and some private markets, too. ""We have distributed potatoes at the major markets according to demands from vegetable sellers. While we have distributed 50 packets of potatoes in Shyambazar, traders at Behala Poura Panya Bithika, a municipal market in Behala, got 30 bags of potatoes,"" said a KMC market department official.Ahmed on Tuesday visited Lake Market to oversee the procedure of sale of potatoes. Singh also accompanied a team of civic officials and visited some of the municipal markets to watch the sale procedure. ""We have asked all market superintendents to ensure that a buyer gets potatoes at the fixed price. We won't spare those we flout the rules,"" Singh said."

315,"In Uttarkashi, life’s still not back on track",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/In-Uttarkashi-lifes-still-not-back-on-track/articleshow/25341448.cms,2013-11-07,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: At 4.30pm, Hukum Singh has been waiting for over two hours to cross the turbulent Bhagirathi river using a makeshift trolley. The hand-pulled trolley is the only option available, as the suspension bridge at Sainj, 18km north of Uttarkashi town, was washed away in the massive floods that ravaged the hill state in June.The trolley is stuck mid-way in the water, and to release it, someone has to pull on the rope from the opposite side. But instead of calling for help from his village Syaba, Singh patiently awaits another wayfarer who needs to cross over from the opposite side. ""Who will walk for three hours just to pull the rope?"" asks Singh, who is nearing 60.It has been almost five months since torrential rains wrecked the state, but the nearly three lakh inhabitants of Uttarkashi, in the northwest corner of Uttarakhand, have been unable to get their lives back on track. Data compiled by Shri Bhuvneshwari Mahila Ashram, an Uttarkashi-based NGO, states that of the roughly 100 villages along the 100km Gangotri highway in Uttarkashi's Bhatwari block, about 20 were badly affected and nearly 50 suffered partial damage.Locals claim the recent floods, dubbed the 'Himalayan Tsunami', washed away at least seven suspension bridges in Bhatwari block alone. The recent tragedy, coupled with earlier flooding, has damaged nearly all link roads which connect the villages, located on mountain tops to the national highway. Earlier these roads, some paved, others pucca, were navigated by villagers on foot, mules and even small cars. After these roads were washed away, villagers have had to manoeuvre the rough terrain instead.The state government recently released advertisements announcing the Gangotri national highway has reopened, but a visit to the region proves normalcy is far from restored. Children, who earlier used bridges to cross over to schools, are walking extra kilometers while farmers are finding it difficult to transport cash crops to the market. Surendra Singh of Kujjan village, roughly 30km north of Uttarkashi, says, ""I don't know how to carry my potato harvest to the highway as the mule trails have been destroyed.""Even access to medical treatment in villages like Pilang and Jadau, among the remotest in the Himalayan district, is challenging. Vikram Singh Rana of Jadau says that two women, Balma Devi and Pata Devi, from his village are due to deliver babies soon, and their relatives are contemplating a home delivery over the risk of carrying them on a chair or stretcher to Bhatwari primary healthcare centre (PHC)  approximately 18km away  given the roads have been washed away.The child birth statistics available at Bhatwari PHC and Uttarkashi district headquarters reveal that 564 deliveries took place between June and September 2013, and given that most of these women are from hill towns, they would have been carried to the hospital.The June floods have made the terrain treacherous, but the locals of Bhatwari have been waiting for over three years for the government to either improve infrastructure or relocate their village. The impending winters are worrisome as by November end, roughly 20 villages beyond Bhatwari market will be covered by snow, hampering restoration work.Uttarakhand chief minister Vijay Bahuguna admits it is a challenging task. ""The condition of hills is different from plains. At many places the road alignment has changed and hence construction of new roads will require fresh land acquisition and forest clearance,"" he told TOI, adding that apple and potato farmers who suffered losses would get relief money in a few days.The work, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Border Road Organization (BRO), has reportedly been delayed because of lack of funds and incessant rains. B C Khandhuri, former Uttarakhand chief minister and India's road and surface transport minister during the NDA regime, claims that in the last financial year, the BRO was given a paltry sum of Rs 20 crore against their estimated expenditure of 270 crore by the central government. ""Till June 2013, the central government had not allocated a single penny to BRO in the Garhwal region,"" he claims.The public works department (PWD) is yet to float tenders to rebuild village link roads, suspension bridges and protection walls.In October, the Uttarakhand state government announced the reopening of the Gangotri national highway and Chardham Yatra. However, infrastructure in Uttarkashi has barely been restored. Public transport has not been re-started and the roads are in such bad condition that local taxi drivers ask as much as are asking Rs 4,000 to travel to Gangotri temple, a journey that normally costs Rs 250.A majority of the shops in town are still closed, as owners are trying to determine how to dispose of their expired goods. Overall the tourist numbers on the Chardham Yatra are dismal. According to the pilgrim inflow data of available with the Uttarakhand government, between October 11 and 21 this year 3,098 tourists went on the yatra  roughly 4% of the number who visited in within this period last year (71,852).The Gangotri temple committee blames the state of affairs on the present condition of roads. However In such a scenario, R Meenakshi Sundaram, DG information, Uttarakhandgovernment, defends the advertisements promoting tourism, ""Tourism is the backbone of our economy and we have to spend the budget allocation on advertisements otherwise we have to return the money."""

The root normally retails for Rs 12-15.Traders have familiar explanations for rising prices, like improved farmers' margins to Cyclone Phailin and increased exports. Maniar, for instance, claimed the entire crop of new potato saplings was wiped out in the rains due to Cyclone Phailin.APMC director Ashok Walunj had assured Mumbaikars that potato prices would not rise. On Wednesday he said, ""The wholesale rate is Rs 16-18 but we have no control over the retail market. Around 80 trucks of potato carrying 18 tonnes each arrive at Vashi each day and no shortage has been reported."" Customers complain stocks are so bad, they have to discard half the purchase. ""It is hurtful to spend Rs 25 per kg and then find most potatoes with rotten black cores,"" said Maria D'Souza, an Amboli resident. But Walunj said, ""Potato is not essential like onion. Every vegetable, be it cauliflower, lady finger, brinjal can be prepared without potato.""Tomato too is dearer, selling for Rs 48-55 in Andheri, Rs 60-65 in Borivli and Rs 70 in Bandra. In north India, it is selling for a princely Rs 100-120 per kg. APMC says unseasonal rain has damaged crops and caused shortage.Onion and tomato prices often rise together. Shardul Sinha, a Kandivli businessman said, ""When onion rises to absurd levels, families tend to fall back on tomato and find that option closed too. The government is a mute spectator, though its own prospects will be harmed in an election year."""

The Chinese onions have landed in India via Afghan and are selling at Rs 50 per kg.Sameer Sheikh, a wholesale onion and potato dealer in the Kalupur vegetable market, said that 4,000 kg of Chinese onions have been bought for the local market. ""This Chinese variety is huge in size as compared to the local produce and is cheaper,"" said Sheikh.Sheikh said that while the local onions weigh roughly 100 gm, the Chinese variety weighs anywhere between 450 gm to 600 gm. ""These onions are huge in size and are being bought by people who use the vegetable in bulk, especially in hotels and restaurants,"" said Sheikh.However, the onion may not find many fans in the long run as it is rather bland in taste which is a downer for people who are used to the pungent taste of raw onions that are known to bring a tear or two in the eyes."

There seems a little scope to save money as the three very basic ingredients of local cooking sell at high prices.Onions continued to sell at Rs 70-80 per kg even as tomatoes too touched the Rs 70 mark. Potatoes which were available around Rs 15-20 per kg sold at Rs 25 per kg.Secretary of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Ahmedabad, Deepak Patel, said that while the prices of onions have gone down to Rs 50 per kg for Maharashtra onions and Rs 33 per kg for the Saurashtra onions, retail vendors failed to pass on the benefit to the consumers as in areas like Navrangpura, Satellite and Vastrapur, onions continued to retail at Rs 70 per kg in carts and shops. Some vendors keen to make the most of the onion price hype even sold the goods at Rs 80 per kg.Tomatoes, which were being used as a substitute for the expensive onions, too have turned the tables against the average middle class housewife, selling at Rs 70 per kg in the retail market. ""The wholesale price of tomatoes is Rs 40 per kg. Currently, there is a scarcity of tomatoes in the local market as the crop has been delayed due to widespread October rains. The city is getting tomatoes from Bangaluru. Dholka and Sanand are major producers of tomatoes, but the crop is expected to hit the markets after 20-25 days,"" Patel said.Patel said that 1,000 quintal tomatoes are sold in Ahmedabad market daily which has reduced to 700-800 quintals due to short supply.Patel said that potatoes which were selling at Rs 15 per kg in the wholesale market a few days back have become expensive selling at Rs 21 on Wednesday. Potatoes were selling at Rs 25-30 in the retail market.Housewives complained that after Diwali almost rendered their pockets empty, the high prices of staple vegetables are difficult to manage. ""One can stop eating onions, but tomatoes and potatoes are used in almost every meal,"" said Sulekha Prajapati, a housewife from Vejalpur."

As Chath festival is closely associated with vegetable and fruits offerings, skyrocketing prices of these commodities have dampened the spirit of devotees.The price pinch has even affected edibles like milk, sugarcane juice and ""duara"" (traditional wooden baskets) used by devotees to make the offerings to the Sun god. While sellers are doing brisk business to maximize profits, people are forced to cut down the Chath offerings.According to fruits and vegetable sellers, fruit prices have gone up by almost 15% to 20% while the vegetables have become dearer. The vegetable and fruit prices remained high during the Diwali and Annakoot too but have skyrocketed during Chath.According to the market prices, Bananas, considered the most sacred offerings, is being sold for Rs 35 to Rs 45 per dozen. Other fruits like pomegranates, apples and 'Singharda' too are being sold at inflated price. Fruit seller Vineet at Phoolbagh fruit mandi said, ""Prices are bound to go up. The bananas are being sold Rs 35-45 per dozen, while apples are available at Rs 80-120 per kg. Similarly, pomegranate is being at Rs 180/kg."" Similar is the scene at vegetable markets as well where even essential vegetables are costing dear to locals due to Chath Puja.Potatoes, the most essential vegetable is available at Rs 30/kg, while tomato has already breached the Rs 60 mark. Apart from potatoes and tomatoes, the most demanded vegetables like pumpkin, bottle-gourd (Lauki) and green leafy vegetables are costing at double rates to the denizens. ""I was shocked when vegetable seller told me that pumpkin is available at Rs 40 per kilogram. A week back I bought it for Rs 25,"" said Sneha.Even sugar and milk has been affected by inflation. Even commodities like jaggery (Gurd) and wooden baskets used during Chath Puja are being sold at inflated rates. Jaggery is an essential component of the Chath Puja as devotees prepare sweet dishes like 'Thekua' and 'Rasiour' with it. It is being sold at Rs 45-50/kg. The buyers are also surprised to find duaras costing Rs 200 to Rs 260 a piece which were being sold at Rs 100 a few days back."

You will have to recompense for your deed... and we will find out a mechanism for this, she said, speaking at Nabanna, her new Secretariat.I have told [Agriculture Minister Arup Roy] you stay as the minister... but for the time being, I will assume the departments responsibilities.Ms. Banerjee exhorted people to shun those who charged exorbitant prices for the vegetable: I seek your cooperation Dont buy from such traders They will automatically fall in line.Prices of the commonly used Jyoti potatoes were ruling at Rs. 16-18 a kg against the normal price-band of Rs. 12-13. The premium variety, Chandramukhi, was selling at Rs. 20 a kg. The government intervened last week, setting a price-band of Rs. 13 for the ordinary variety.The premium variety is being sold for Rs. 25 a kg.Ms. Banerjee said a control room had been set up to check malpractices after it emerged that trucks carrying potatoes were being diverted to neighbouring States and traders were fleeing the State.The government will not allow any hoarding and, if necessary, will clear out cold storages. If traders are found guilty of hoarding, their licences will be cancelled, Ms. Banerjee said.She said although the Chief Ministers of Orissa and Assam had asked the State to supply supplies of the tuber, her priority was to feed her people first."

The total allocation per family would be 1 kg of potato.She said the administration had procured 265 bags of potatoes from the cold storages in Kharibari block in Siliguri sub-division and 80 bags from neighbouring Jalpaiguri district. These would be distributed from ration shops in civic areas and blocks from today.Siliguri gets potatoes from south Bengal districts but the trucks from Burdwan have stopped coming.We used to get potatoes on regular basis from Burdwan but have not received supply from there since November 1, said Tapan Saha, the secretary of Siliguri Regulated Market Fruits and Vegetable Commission Agents Association."

Picture by Arijit Saha Calcutta, Nov. 6: Assuming charge of the agri-marketing department, Mamata Banerjee today vowed to take toughest possible steps against unscrupulous potato wholesalers who are manipulating markets and ban sale of the tuber to other states. After visiting some wholesale markets, including Koley in Bowbazar and the one in Sealdah, with senior government officials and Calcutta police commissioner Surajit Kar Purkayastha, the chief minister said: I am taking charge of the agricultural marketing department from now. Arup (Roy) will continue to remain the minister of the department but I will work hands-on for sometime. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused in the markets over the past few days. But let me assure you, we are trying our best, she added. The chief ministers apology today was a tacit admission that the co-ordination between different government departments  including agriculture and agricultural marketing  could not ensure smooth supply of potatoes at a regulated rate. With potatoes disappearing from almost all big, medium and small retail markets in Calcutta and the districts, frustration of the buyers is spiralling. Accusing a section of wholesalers of cheating people and betraying our trust, Mamata said: The government will take the toughest possible steps against these unscrupulous traders and a few individuals. If required, their licences will be cancelled. Customers queue up outside Maniktala market to buy potato at Rs 13 a kg from a government outlet. Picture by Amit Datta We will not spare those who have deprived our people and tried to sell potatoes to other states. There are a few who are trying to manipulate the markets. We will not leave them. Hoi espaar noi ospaar (we will resolve this any which way). The chief minister said she would not allow any lorry carrying potatoes to move out of the state till the time we are self-sufficient. I have spoken to the chief ministers of Odisha and Assam. They are my good friends but I cant give them potatoes at our cost, Mamata said. She said the police would escort trucks from godowns to retail markets to ensure potatoes were not diverted elsewhere to facilitate hoarding by a group of traders. Within hours of her comments, the police stopped seven trucks carrying potatoes to Jharkhand from Asansol. The raids will continue for the next few days with officials from the enforcement branch assisting the local police, a senior officer said. If this mornings visit provided the chief minister some information about the market dynamics of the demand and supply of potatoes, it also marked the return of the tuber at government-run counters across Calcutta later in the day. Homemaker Hemchaya Roy of Amherst Street, who could not spot potatoes in the market earlier in the day, said she was happy to know that it was available later. In the morning, potatoes were not available in the market. In the afternoon, one of my neighbours told me that a truckload of potatoes had arrived outside the market, she said. With Mamata cracking the whip, government counters, including those run by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, started selling the Jyoti variety of potato at Rs 13 a kilo, a price pegged by the chief minister. We are giving a maximum of 3 kilos to an individual, said a member of the task force set up by Mamata to keep vegetable prices in check. The result was obvious  long queues in front of stalls and potato counters. At Maniktala market, around 200 people waited in a queue. With the queues likely to get longer if the supply of potatoes in retail markets is disrupted, Mamata said her government was committed  morally and politically  to ensure that the people were not deprived of adequate supply of the tuber."

The state government on Friday wrote to the Centre asking for approval to include potato in the list of essential commodities.Sources in the state secretariat said Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has taken charge of the agri-marketing department, is monitoring the supply crisis across markets in Kolkata and rest of the state. Officials are confident of getting Delhis consent as potato is being sold in Delhis markets for as high as Rs 85-88 per kg.While the chief minister clamped down on transport of potato to neighbouring states like Odisha and Jharkhand on Thursday after prices soared to Rs 40 a kg last week, and pegged the price at Rs 13, potato vanished from markets across Kolkata, only to make a brief appearance on Thursday and Friday following some supply from government godowns. Although the government had to step in to supply potato, the demand was far higher than the supply and potato was mostly out of sight, if not out of range for a large section of buyers.Lack of supplyEven in wholesale markets of Kolkata, a large number of potato sellers have stayed away from opening their shops due to lack of supply.Around five to six sacks of old potatoes have been coming in for the last few mornings and are vanishing soon. Once their potatoes are sold out, sellers are shutting their shops and leaving by noon, said a senior functionary from the Posta Wholesalers Association, an organisation that controls wholesale vegetable markets in north and central Kolkata.According to government sources, Mamata told the Posta traders on Thursday that she would ensure the profits unscrupulous traders made by selling potatoes outside Bengal are recovered.I will ensure that the profits which you made in the past three days are recovered, she said, reminding them that they all signed a document agreeing to sell potato to retail markets at Rs 13 a kg."

If farmers get paid Rs 10 per kg, while the consumers pay anywhere between Rs 80-100 per kg of onion, there is obviously something seriously wrong in the way onion market operates.Onions, tomatoes and potatoes have witnessed a sharp rise in prices primarily due to the prolonged monsoon which has delayed harvest and sowing of fresh crop.Onion prices in the retail market are in the range of Rs 60-70 per kg, while prices of tomatoes have gone up to Rs 70-80 per kg in the capital.Anwar said there were governance issues related to licensing of wholesalers, holding capacity of farmers, market prices information and issues related to the wholesale supply chain which created the kind of pricing contradiction."

Vegetable vendor: But why, sir? Policeman: You are selling potato at Rs 25 a kg. The chief minister has said you cannot sell at more than Rs 13 a kg. Shopper: Sir, I am willing to pay Rs 25. We havent had potato in the past few days. Policeman: The chief minister has said potato cannot be sold at more than Rs 13 a kg. Shopper: This is unfair. There is no potato in the market. Policeman: I am a family man and I know the situation. If you dont have potato for a few days, it will not create any problem. The conversation was overheard this morning at Belgachhia bazaar as personnel from Talla police station raided the market to check the prevailing price of potato. As the vegetable vendor and shoppers argued with the cop, other personnel packed the vendors potato stock in a gunny bag and took it to the police station. This is strange. The government cannot supply potato to the markets and will also not let us buy it at higher prices, a shopper said as the policemen left the market. Other markets in Calcutta and its suburbs, such as Santoshpur and Thakurpukur, did not have any potato stock this morning as the supply promised by the government did not reach them. In some prominent markets in Maniktala, College Street and Gariahat, demand far outweighed the supply of potato, whose price has been pegged at Rs 13 a kg by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. A similar crisis prevailed in Behala, Thakurpukur and Santoshpur in South 24-Parganas and in Salt Lake. While some retailers faced action from the police for selling potato at higher prices, others did not even try to sell their stock. The fear psychosis resulted in potato vanishing from the markets, a source in the potato industry said. Potato was available in the markets from noon after Mamata heard that stocks had not reached them and held a meeting with her aides. While inaugurating a Jagaddhatri puja at the wholesale market in Posta in the evening, the chief minister pulled up a potato trader, albeit in jest. The chief minister accused a section of traders of creating an artificial crisis in the market by first selling the cheaper Jyoti variety to neighbouring states and then going on a three-day strike last weekend, which aggravated the crisis. They betrayed me. They told me they would first take care of the demand in the state and then sell potato to the neighbouring states. But they did not keep their promise, Mamata said in Posta, one of the biggest wholesale markets of Calcutta. Sources said the chief ministers tough words had prompted the police, enforcement directorate and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to swing into action and ensure that the tuber reached several markets from noon. A lorry carrying potato reached Maniktala market around noon. At Ashu Babu bazaar in Talla and markets in Belgachhia and Shyambazar, lorries arrived around 1pm. Within minutes, hundreds of people queued up to buy the tuber. Agriculture department officials said they managed to bring 120 truckloads of potato to Calcutta, less than half the demand of 300 truckloads. We could not cover all the markets today because of supply bottlenecks. But we hope to cover all markets tomorrow, said a member of the task force constituted by the chief minister to monitor the prices of essential edibles. Prabhat Kumar Das, a member of the Federation of Traders Organisation, said there was excess demand in the markets because people are trying to stock potato. But the situation will become normal in the coming days, he said. The agriculture department officials spoke on similar lines. Some, however, expressed apprehension that the crisis might recur. Coercive techniques may solve the problem for the time being, but it will recur, an official in the agricultural marketing department said. Aniruddha Mukherjee, the chief manager, markets, CMC, said almost all markets would be covered tomorrow and retailers would get potato at Rs 11 a kg. Fifteen lorries of potato will be kept ready at Sakherbazar and Behala to serve south Calcutta and 15 more will reach Ultadanga for supply to markets in north Calcutta, he said."

At some places, traders have resorted to black-marketing. Potato was being sold somewhere between Rs. 35 and Rs. 40 per kilogram.Even as the crisis over potato scarcity is growing by the day, the State government is struggling to rein in black-marketing and hoarding. In major markets potato, an essential food ingredient in kitchens of the State, has vanished since Wednesday.The crisis started after the West Bengal government decided to restrict movement of potato stocks from the State from October 24. During the past one week, the entire stock available in the State has been exhausted. Odisha is fully dependant on West Bengal for potato.Trucks seizedA helpless civil supplies department on Thursday seized two trucks of potato near Aiginia. We have taken control of two trucks of potato and distributed among 174 public distribution outlets and ensured that the price is not inflated, said Jnanendriya Mishra, Inspector of Supplies in Bhubaneswar.State looks at optionsThe State government on Thursday said it was looking to import potato from other sources.It is a supply-demand issue. We have to augment supply in order to tackle the crisis. If potato is not coming from West Bengal, we would look for supply from other sources, said Chief Secretary J. K. Mohapatra.However, market experts say that attempts to get potato stock from States other than West Bengal would prove futile. Potato is produced in Punjab and Haryana. But the price of potato would sharply go up if it is imported from northern States.Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has called up West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to relax norms on potato export from the State.At Cuttack tooEven as the Cuttack district administration on Thursday made an attempt to sell potatoes at fair price shops at a reasonable price of Rs. 20 a kilo, the 32 shops run by the civil supply department were not enough to meet the demand of the city. More shockingly, potatoes were not available with any vendor on the day in the citys biggest vegetable market at Chhatrabazar.At some places in the city, outside the vegetable mandi, potatoes were selling at Rs. 30 per kg making it nearly beyond the reach of even the salaried class to buy the essential vegetable.If potatoes have vanished from the market, other available vegetables are impossible to lay hands on. Prices of every vegetable are above Rs. 50 a kg, said a government employee in dismay.Stock exhaustedThe fair price shops run by the district civil supply department however, made an attempt to sell potatoes at Rs. 20 a kg.But soon the 32 fair price shops had to down their shutters as their stocks were exhausted in no time.We had supplied only two sacks of potatoes to every shop and it was rationed selling only one kg to each buyer, said an employee of the department."

But where are the potatoes? a bewildered Das asked after failing to spot a single potato vendor. Trucks carrying the tuber arrived at the market around four hours later. A few kilometres away at Entally market, members of the local market association were grappling with the problem of plenty. They turned away a lorry half filled with potatoes around 11am as there were no takers. Around 6 this morning, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation sent 3,500kg of potatoes, which were sold within a few hours. A few hours later, a lorry full of potatoes sent by the agri-marketing department arrived. Only a few hundred kilograms of that stock could be sold as there were hardly any customers later in the day. The lorry left with half the stock, said Prashanta Bose, a member of the Entally Market Traders Association. The two contrasting pictures captured how the governments intervention to counter the potato crisis has not been able to provide relief to customers, who have not got the tuber in markets for the past one week. Potatoes at Rs 13 a kg, a price pegged by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, eluded some markets in Calcutta today while in others, there was a glut. The overall supply has been much less than the demand. Officials of various agencies supplying potatoes at the pegged price said the situation was better today, adding that the government had sold the tuber in almost all markets in and around the city. Today, the government supplied 46.6 metric tonnes of potatoes to markets in and around Calcutta. In the next few days, more potatoes will be available, a member of the task force formed by the chief minister to keep a check on prices of essential edibles said. Todays supply was at least 18 metric tonnes less than the citys average daily consumption of potatoes. Although the supply was enough to cater to large parts of the city and its suburbs in a reduced quantity, the deficit, combined with lopsided supply logistics and hoarding by some consumers, ensured that the crisis did not ebb. Some markets received potatoes supplied by the government late in the day. Thinking there is a shortage, customers who consume less than 1kg a day are buying 3kg, the ceiling set by the government. This is compounding the problem, said Tarak Nath Trivedi, the general secretary of the Federation of Traders Organisation of West Bengal. Traders in many markets said lorries carrying government-supplied potatoes were arriving when most customers had left. The lorries should arrive by 7am, when most shoppers come to the markets, Trivedi said. But the lorries are coming around 11am, another trader said. Members of the task force, which has CMC, enforcement directorate, police and agri-marketing officials, said the government did not have the logistics to supply potatoes to so many markets across the state. We are facing problems arranging for so many lorries to carry potatoes to so many parts of the state, a member said. In North 24-Parganas Deganga, a scuffle broke out between customers and traders selling potatoes at Rs 20 a kg. While the customers demanded that potatoes be sold at Rs 13 a kg, the shop owners said they couldnt do so as they had procured the tuber at Rs 15 a kg. As soon as the police intervened, traders stopped selling potatoes in markets in Deganga and neighbouring Jibanpur and Sandhipukur."
332,Tit-for-tat plan in potato row,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131109/jsp/odisha/story_17545613.jsp,2013-11-09,Telegraph,"A potato vendor sitting idle without any stock at Capital Market in Bhubaneswar on Friday. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee Bhubaneswar, Nov. 8: The Bengal government-designed potato shortage has prompted vegetable sellers in Odisha to plan a retaliation. The traders associations in Balasore have threatened to detain trucks carrying essential commodities and fish from Andhra Pradesh and other states to Bengal on the national highway passing through this district in retaliation to the Bengal governments decision. Despite chief minister Naveen Patnaik requesting his counterpart in Bengal, the largest supplier of potato to Odisha, to consider demands of the people here and supply some tubers, the Mamata Banerjee government refused to supply potato to the state. It even kept vigil on the borders to check exports on the sly. A trader here said many of their trucks had been detained at the borders. We will block the national highway at Remuna round about and detain all the trucks carrying fish, a favoured dish for the people of Bengal, to their state from tomorrow. Many of our traders, who had purchased potato from the border districts of Bengal, were forcibly taken away by local police, alleged Fakir Biswal, secretary of the Perishable Goods Association. The traders and truckers association have given the district administration 24-hour time to sort out the problem, or else they would detain trucks from Saturday. Odishas most popular vegetable disappeared from the markets with the government failing to make any arrangements for procuring the tuber crop from other states. Baramunda resident Suchismita Kar had to return empty handed from the market, where she had gone to buy potatoes. Her husband also drew a blank. Without potato it is difficult to think of a dish. My husband went to the largest wholesale market at Unit-I and somehow managed to buy only half-a-kg for Rs 25 from Unit-IV, she said. However, by noon, all the shops were empty with no potatoes available. Everyday, over 350 to 400 truckloads of potato come to Odisha from Bengal. While there is a daily need of around 25 truckloads in Bhubaneswar, 40 trucks come to Balasore and its adjoining areas and at least 15 trucks to Cuttack. But with Bengal governments restriction in place for the past few days, a few trucks were coming, and this has been reduced to almost zero for the past two days. Yesterday, the civil supply officials had seized two trucks of potato as there was a law and order situation at the godown in Aigania. It provided around 27,350kg of potato to 140 government-regulated shops and 12 Udyan fresh stalls to sell at Rs 22-a-kg with a bar of 2kg to one person. In Balasore, the officials also took control of a cold storage that had around 1,500 quintals of potato and sold it at a lower rate to the people. Before the vegetable completely vanished from the markets in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, it was being sold at Rs 50 to Rs 60 a kilo. In Balasore, it has been sold at Rs 35 to Rs 40 a kilo. Its the month of Kartik, when we are bound to have vegetarian food and we have been roaming from market to market for potato that has disappeared completely, said Soudamini Rath, a Badambadi resident. However, sources in the government said they were trying to procure potato from other states, as the Bengal government did not come to its rescue. The government is also trying to procure the tubers from Kanpur, which supplies the vegetable to west Odisha. There are also talks to procure potato from Punjab, but it would take sometime for the decision to take shape and stocks to arrive. Its a demand-supply situation, where demand has exceeded supply. We were trying to get potato from Bengal. As the government there did not supply the tubers to us, we will look for other states to purchase it, said chief secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra. Secretary of the food supplies and consumer welfare department Madhusudan Padhee said they had been trying to bring stocks from Kandhamal and Koraput. Around 3,000 tonnes of potato have been there. But it is very less as the entire state depends on it. Even the traders there have started selling it at a higher rate, while it was selling there at Rs 12 to Rs 14 a kilogram. The Bengal government faces the same scarcity, but they are considering our request. Though the shortage will be there, we hope the situation will change a little by Monday, said Padhee. In another development, the Opposition parties blamed the government for not taking appropriate measures on time, which created such artificial disappearance of potato from markets. Senior congress leader Niranjan Patnaik said such situation had been there for long. The state government did not take steps properly and the situation went out of control, he said. Senior BJP leader Bijay Mohapatra blamed the governments insensitivity to the problems of the common man for the present crisis. They should bring potato from outside the state to cater to the need here, said Mohapatra."

There are some who have the erroneous impression that West Bengal is a separate country and its borders can be sealed for such transport of such agriculture produce to other parts of India, Mr. Bhattacharya said."

If the going rate of onions is Rs 60 per kg in most parts of the city, tomato rates have shot up to as much as Rs 50 and even Rs 70 a kg in some areas. Potato prices are hovering around Rs 30-40 a kg in the city, when they were selling for around Rs 20 a kg till a week ago.Wholesalers said poor supply of the three kitchen staples has pushed up their rates. While the city's potato supply comes from the country's north, tomatoes and onions come from Pune's surrounding areas. Traders said that a huge demand building up for the vegetables from other parts of the country has affected their supply to the city.Ritesh Poman, onion trader at the city's wholesale market explained that closure of the Lasalgaon market has further led to the price rise. ""With the Nashik market closed remaining closed for a full week on account of Diwali, the stock, which would have come to Pune alone, is now being sent to the southern states and even Delhi as well. Supply is already short, with chunks of the new supply too spoilt by heavy rains, and it is ultimately pushing up prices in the city. Retailers also need to keep a margin for spoilages, which is reflecting in the high retail prices,"" he said, but added that the situation would improve next week.Other traders, however, are not so optimistic. Shivlal Bhosale, president of the Market Yard Commission Agents Association, said it could take at least a month for prices of potatoes and tomatoes to come down.Citizens tweak menu to manage budgetNot only has the city's supply of onions, tomatoes and potatoes come down, but the quality of the available stock has also deteriorated.""Supply of tomatoes is down by about half, while that of potatoes is almost 40% less. The cyclone in Orissa, which was followed by heavy rains, have spoilt large parts of both the crops in the south, which is putting pressure on their supply from other centres. Until new stocks of the crop reach the market, their prices will not come down,"" said Bhosale, president of the Market Yard Commission Agents Association.The same logic is being offered by retailers too, who say they are helpless in the face of booming wholesale rates. ""Supply of many vegetables is less, so we end up getting our supply at a higher-thanusual rate. We have no other option but to increase our selling prices,"" said Rajeev Prajapati, a vegetable vendor in Model Colony. Rates are no different even at supermarkets, with a gourmet grocery chain selling tomatoes for as much as Rs 52 per kg, while onions at the store were priced for as much as Rs 73 per kg.Citizens said the rising prices have them at their wits' end. Smita Mahadik, a resident of Lohegaon said her monthly budget has spun out of control. ""Earlier it was only onions, but now tomatoes too are very expensive. We have no other option but to cut down on our purchases,"" she said.Karve Road resident Mangala Asher not only expressed concern over the prices, but also pointed to the poor quality which was being offered in the market. ""Two out of every five onions are rotten and smelly, while tomatoes are selling like they are as precious as gold. The new variety of potatoes is completely tasteless. It's difficult to make any dish without these three staples, so a lot of recipes have gone off our menu since the last few days.Forget cooking nonvegetarian food, even basic Maharashtrian vegetables of are tasteless without tomatoes and onions, but it's difficult to purchase them at these rates,"" she said."

The arrival of fresh vegetable will start only in December.In Kolhapur, the retail price of potato has been hovering between Rs 30 and Rs 38 per kilogram over the last couple of days, depending on the quality of the vegetable. With onion prices skyrocketing, these are expensive days if buying just two vegetables cost Rs 100.Maharashtra depends upon the north Indian states and Karnataka for potato supply, since its domestic production of the vegetable is inadequate to meet demands. In western Maharashtra, agriculture market produce committees (APMCs) receive marginal supplies from Satara, Belgaum in Karnataka and the northern Indian states. The supply had dropped significantly, say experts and traders.""At Kolhapur, we receive 10 to 15 truckloads of potato each day. This has dropped to four to five truckloads over the last week. This has affected the demand, because that remains constant. Over the past 30 days, the district consumed 464 tonnes of potato. Now the supply is so low that there only a single truckload was available a couple of days back. Obviously, this has forced the market to shoot up the price,"" said Dilip Maruti Raut, head of the onion-potato market of the Kolhapur agriculture market produce committee.Agra and Indore are the largest centres from where the state receives potato. ""These two centres have a large number of cold storages, where potato from the north Indian states are stored. These supply the vegetable to the Vashi market in New Mumbai and we receive truckloads from them,"" Raut said.The shortage has resulted in doubling up the retail market price over a period of just two months. ""This morning, I purchased potato from the wholesale market at Rs 3,000 per quintal. I have to sell it at Rs 35 per kg in retail to keep my business feasible. Consumers are asking me why the prices have gone up from a day earlier, which was Rs 28. I don't have any answers,"" said Salim Bagwan, a retail trader from Shivaji Market, a central vegetable market in the city.Small vendors and hoteliers that make batate vada, a typical Maharashtrian snack staple, are facing rough times. ""We are using potato and onions with extra care. No wastage is allowed while making. I have to spend hundreds of rupees more to buy potato for our weekly consumption and I cannot hike batate vada rates due to the market competition,"" said Somnath Shinde, owner of Janta Bhuvan, a small restaurant at Laxmipuri.Nilesh Vaze, who runs a chain of restaurants titled Khidki Vada specializing in batate vada, is being very careful of purchases. ""We have restaurants in Kalyan, Pune and Kolhapur. We are buying potatoes from our traditional agents in the markets and till now have survived the price hike heat. We can control the costs because ours' is a chain-business. The situation is certainly difficult for retail and small food vendors,"" Vaze said."

Retailers do not seem interested selling potatoes on the plea that they had bought potatoes at higher rates and the police are forcing them to sell both varieties - 'Jyoti' and 'Chandramukhi' - at government rates.Though potato supplied to the city on Friday exceeded its daily demand by 200 tonnes, most of the consumers, who headed to markets hoping to find the vegetable, returned empty-handed. Those who managed to find the potatoes at the markets had brawls with the retailers with the latter refusing to sell the 'Jyoti' variety at the Rs 13 a kg rate fixed by the state. And the little that did find its way to markets sparked heated arguments and even clashes between retailers and consumers with the former refusing to sell the Jyoti variety at the Rs 13 a kg firxed by the government, citing their need to maintaa prfit margin.A market at Deganga North 24-Parganas witnessed one such retailer-consumer clash.The disruption the regular distribution system was evident four key potato wholesale markets the state - Hooghly's Ratanpur, West Midnapore's Chandrakona, Burdwan's Jamalpur and Bankura's Kotulpur. Hardly any wholesalers turned up fearing police raids.

Sushanta Das of Singur's Jaminberia said, ""In August, 50 kg packets were selling for anything between Rs 220 and Rs 260. Now that price has more than doubled. We remaat the mercy of middlemen."" Samanta, however, said normal supply of potato to the city should start getting restored from Saturday and prices should start declining too. Traders are concerned over arrival of the new crop from Punjab and UP pushing down prices further.The government is making every effort to get traders involved the supply chato restore normalcy potato distribution.

Not a single kg of the tuber was available in Odisha markets on Friday.As frustrated consumers raided shops, traders at many places downed shutters and hid behind them. Potatoes were conspicuous in their absence at the Unit-1 market, the state's biggest daily market. Government officials raided some godowns in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and other places and channelled the seized stock for distribution at 2 kg per family at Rs 20 per kg through fair price shops, but that was too little to control the mad scramble at several places.Odisha consumes around 10 lakh tonne potato per annum, but produces barely 2 lakh tonne. Like many essential items, the state depends on import of potato from other states, mostly West Bengal. ""We need about 400 trucks of potato daily. Trouble started when Bengal government stopped export more than a week back,"" a senior agriculture department official said.As the crisis deepened, chief secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra spoke to his West Bengal counterpart seeking lifting of the export ban. ""The West Bengal chief secretary has assured resumption of movement of trucks from Friday evening. We hope the situation will improve soon,"" food supplies and consumer welfare department secretary M S Padhi said.Health minister Damodar Rout said the mad rush for potato was avoidable. ""Nobody will die without potato,"" he remarked. The opposition, however, came down heavily on the government."

Every other question  from the first dish he ever cooked, to the one that took the longest to master  produces an animated narration of how the preparation came to be. ""For the sambhar, you need white pumpkin, drumstick and a type of root called 'koka'"", begins the septuagenarian, when asked about his foremost foray into the kitchen. ""You fry chopped small onions in coconut oil, soak the tamarind for 15 minutes, then prepare the dal separately."" Sundaram has also jotted down recipes in five fat notebooks over the years. While some are from cookery shows in Tamil and Malayalam, many are his own inventions. From first making rasam as a teenager, to rustling up lunch and dinner at his Borivali home today, Sundaram's culinary enthusiasm spans over six decades.With a host of television competitions and workshops suddenly making it trendy to be a guy who cooks, weekend experiments with Mediterranean chicken and spaghetti carbonara are fast gaining ground. But for those like Sundaram, cooking isn't a Sunday indulgence or an occasional hobby. It's a regular  sometimes tedious, mostly enjoyable  part of the day, and they have been doing it long before the advent of prettily shot food-shows.""I started cooking when I was about 15 years old,"" recalls Sundaram. ""My elder brother and I were living with our grandmother, and she was an expert."" When paati fell ill, she asked her younger grandson to help out in the kitchen. He debuted with sambhar, picked up from observing granny cook. The experiment was successful. ""I was congratulated like anything by her,"" he adds, grinning. ""'God bless you. Future will be bright for you.'""While he then continued making stray forays into the kitchen, it was after marriage that it became an everyday activity. His wife was a teacher and left for work at 6am. Sundaram, whose office hours began later, began packing his own dabba. ""I didn't like the canteen food,"" he says. ""So I used to cook in the morning, and also keep some for my wife's lunch. She would come home around noon.""After retirement, Sundaram took over the kitchen, cooking lunch and dinner through the week. Today, it's only when he visits Belgaum for a few weeks every year, tending to his organic farm, that his wife cooks the main meals.Stay-at-home dad Ajay Bhandari takes charge of dinner for his 18-month-old twins and banker wife. The 45-year-old often refers to recipes in newspaper supplements, and lends his own twist to tried-and-tested favourites. ""Some days ago, coriander prices had fallen after a long time,"" he says. ""I bought a huge bunch and was wondering what to do with it."" He made kothimbir vadis, but steamed them before frying, so that they turned out looking like dhoklas.Bhandari is matter-of- fact about cooking daily, and doesn't consider men venturing into the kitchen as a ground-breaking expedition of sorts. Shaking up the menu, he says, is a necessity when you're cooking every day, especially for toddlers. ""For example, the kids like bhindi a lot,"" Bhandari says. ""So sometimes, I add potato to the sabzi, or dried coconut, or gravy of some sort."" Occasionally, the trial runs are hit-and-miss. ""A lot of effort goes into each dish so when something doesn't work well, I do feel a bit low,"" he admits. ""But then I try to present it in a different manner, hoping the family likes it the next time.""Balancing inspiration with individual preferences is also a challenge that Chandra Shekhar Ghildiyal has learnt to handle. The 41-year-old design consultant cooks everything from ""boring assembly sandwiches"" and banana muffins to his take on patti samosas, made with leftover chapattis, sabzi stuffing and cheese. ""When you have a school-going kid, they are always going to ask for something 'different'"", Ghildiyal explains. ""So you constantly need to think of something new, which is also nutritious.""At the Sundaram household, wife Vijaya protests that while she likes most of her husband's inventions, the fare can occasionally veer into the too-spicy territory. Sundaram indignantly brushes off the charge. ""I can cook non-veg dishes and also Chinese,"" he adds slyly, as Vijaya shakes her head. ""But that is all banned here!"" Sundaram remembers to mention however that he can't top his wife's snacks and sweets. This earns him a conceding smile. Peace is restored again.The idea of men cooking, adds Ghildiyal, is a practical need today that can't be shrugged off. ""As the lines between the roles of men and women are getting increasingly blurred, knowing how to cook is a necessity. Men just can't get away with saying that they won't go into the kitchen anymore."""

The 12 big potato godowns in Chhatra bazaar, state's biggest vegetable market, are all facing the problem. These godowns supply potato to sub-wholesalers and retailers.Traders said everyday 15 to 18 truckloads of potatoes (each of 16 tonne) enters Chhatra Bazaar but since Monday the number has dropped to just one, leading to an acute shortage of potato in the market.Traders have blamed the state government for the situation.

We will procure potatoes at higher rates but the government will seize our trucks and force us to sell them at cheaper prices.

While the traders association also feel that state government should deal with West Bengal government in a stricter manner.""It's not that we are only dependent on West Bengal for potato. It also depends on us for rice, iron ore and coal. Efforts should be made by state government to make the neighbouring state realise our importance,"" said president of Chhatra Bazaar Traders' Association Debendra Sahoo.Traders are more worried as the arrival of new stock of potato will take at least three months.

There are long queues at the fair price shops from 6 am to get just 2 kg of potatoes at subsidy, but there is no uncertainty that you will get the ingredient as there is limited supply,"" said Santosh Sahu, a 'dahibara-aludam' seller. ""Potato crisis has affected our business as customers are not willing to pay a higher price due to rise in potato prices,"" he added.Though potato was available in some shops in Unit-I market, the quality was not good and vendors sold it at Rs 35 to 40 a kilo. ""If this situation persists, then our families will starve. There is no substitute for potato in majority of street foods,"" said Prafulla Kumar Sahu, a food cart owner.Street food vendore selling 'chat', 'papdi chat', 'sandwich' and 'alu tikki' are trying to replace potato with carrot, coconut and green peas.Restaurant owners are planning to increase the prices of food items.

""The government is closely monitoring the situation,"" said Naveen.Food supplies and consumer welfare (FSCW) minister Pratap Keshari Deb said, ""There is no supply from West Bengal yet and the scarcity will continue till potato reaches the state from other sources.

Most potato traders did not open their shops while few shops sold little amount of potato seeds to desperate customers. Aiginia cold storage on the city outskirts witnessed ugly scenes as frantic people locked up the godown demanding a sales counter there.Admitting the situation as a wakeup call for the state, FSCW secretary Madhusudan Padhi said, ""We have some amount of potato in different cold storages and we are trying to make optimum use of the available stock.

People in the state are grappling with soaring prices, especially onion and green vegetables. While rising onion prices have been linked to countrywide crisis, vegetable prices touched a new high because of Cyclone Phailin in October.As most of the vegetable crops were destroyed, more people got dependent on potatoes till the time prices went up.Market experts say Phailin backlash was felt in most of the eastern states, including Jharkhand and West Bengal.

347,"Potato still hot, scientists show way",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131111/jsp/odisha/story_17551908.jsp,2013-11-11,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, Nov. 10: Potatoes continue to be beyond the reach of consumers despite efforts by the state government to end the crisis. Barring select government-sponsored outlets, where it is being sold at regulated prices of Rs 20 to Rs 25, the rates of potato in the open market still vary between Rs 80 and Rs 90, that, too, if it is available at all. In Balasore, the state government today seized 64 tonnes of potatoes that came in seven trucks from Bengal. Of these, four potato-laden trucks were diverted to Jagatsinghpur, while the potato that was recovered from the remaining three trucks, would be distributed in Balasore district at Rs 20 per kg. Wholesalers in cities such as Bhubaneswar and Cuttack have been forced to down shutters because of scarcity of the tuber. The situation has remained unchanged for the last three days, with the tuber practically vanishing from the platter of the people across the state. People are being forced to make do with drumsticks and papaya that are grown mostly in their garden. But when bought in the open market, even these vegetables are pinching the pocket. The price of drumsticks, which normally sell for Rs 30 per kg, has jumped more than five times, reaching Rs 160 to Rs 200 per kg. The price of papaya also has touched Rs 50 to Rs 60 per kg from Rs 10 to 12 per kg. After Phailin hit the state on October 12, the rate of papaya crashed drastically to Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg as all the trees were uprooted and the vegetables were available in abundance. It was the same case for drumstick, which was being sold at a lower-than-usual rate just after the cyclone. But now, the price of these vegetables have increased exorbitantly and people dare not touch these products, said Santosh Kumar Sahu, a trader at Unit-I market. He said most of the drumsticks were being supplied to the major markets of Bhubaneswar from Palasa in Andhra Pradesh. Besides, local products occupy the market during this season. Even Keonjhar and Jajpur belt, where drumsticks are cultivated in large scale, provide this vegetable to the market here and outside the state. But, the cyclone destroyed all the trees in these areas, badly affecting the price of drumsticks, said Sahu. He said that while more than five tonnes of drumstick used to be sold in the market here every day, traders were now forced to procure drumsticks from Tamil Nadu in very small quantities. Traders said the local production of papaya during this season normally sustained the local market till the first week of March every year. But, the cyclone, rain and flood uprooted these trees. The local market procures papaya from Dhenkanal, Athgarh, Angul and Satasankh in Puri. As all the papaya trees have been uprooted, we are forced to procure it from Bengal, East Godavari area of Andhra Pradesh and other states. But, many of our trucks have been detained on the border by Bengal government officials even though these trucks do not carry potato, said a trader. The traders even blamed the state government for the disappearance of potato from the market. Though the government failed to procure potato from Bengal, we could have got this vegetable from other states in our own way. But, the government officials have been raiding our trucks and seizing potatoes. So, no one wants to procure it in their own capacity and suffer loss, said another trader. On the other hand, brinjal is being sold at Rs 60 per kg, tomato at Rs 70, onion at Rs 55 and ginger at Rs 120. Secretary of Kuberpuri Potato Merchants Association Shakti Shankar Mishra said: We have contacted potato wholesalers of various states. Many potato-laden trucks are likely to reach the city within two days. However, the price of the potato is not likely to go down very soon. In Cuttack, Mahanagar Citizens Committee today organised a rally at Gopalpur on NH-5 to protest against the Bengal governments decision not to send any potato-laden truck to Odisha. What should be doneThere should be mechanism to supply good quality potato seeds as tubers, tissue culture- produced tubers or true potato seeds (as used in the northeastern states)There should be enough storage space as the state has only 14 cold store units, while it needs 200There should be scope for proper irrigation in regions such as Koraput, Phulbani and Sundargarh, where potatoes can be produced in twice a yearTechnical knowhow on potato production should be provided to farmers lFarmers also need enough subsidy and loan guarantee support from banksMarket linkage of the production should be ensured, minimum support price decidedand crop should be linked to public distribution network so that it can be available to allHow to go aboutFrom Feb 2014, state government should collect good quality potato seeds from Punjab or Uttar Pradesh at affordable price and store them for distribution among farmersLike in Karnataka, potato production can be taken up in public-private partnership. Karnataka has invited farmers from Punjab to boost potato productionIf annual potato production is 6-7 lakh tonnes a year, there will be no recurrence of the present crisisSteps takenHorticulture directorate will set up eight modern cold storage units across the state this yearModernisation of seven existing old cold stores is also in the pipelineThere is already a plan to get 19,500 quintal potato seeds from PunjabAwareness campaigns and demonstration workshops for farmers have also been planned"

350,Appeal to govt to lift ban on potato export,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131111/jsp/bengal/story_17552944.jsp,2013-11-11,Telegraph,"Two of the 23 trucks stopped in Burdwans Kulti earlier this week. Picture by Santosh Kumar Mandal Nov. 10: Potato traders in Hooghly and Burdwan, the two biggest producers of the crop in Bengal, have appealed to the government to lift the ban on export of the tuber to other states as they have taken advance payments for consignments. The traders said they were losing goodwill for their failure to deliver the consignments within the stipulated time. The potato traders in the two districts sell half their produce every year to Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The Bengal government has banned the export of potatoes after a shortage pushed up prices of the tuber in the state. Earlier this week, police stopped at the Duburdih checkpost in Burdwans Kulti 23 trucks carrying 300 tonnes of potatoes to Jharkhand. The trucks had valid challans. The traders were paid Rs 11.60 a kg and the potatoes were sold in retail markets in Asansol at Rs 13 a kg, a price pegged by the chief minister. The traders were supposed to sell the consignment at Rs 15 a kg in Jharkhand. Sagar Sarkar, the president of the Burdwan chapter of the West Bengal Progressive Potato Traders Association, said: We have appealed to the agri-marketing department to allow us to export potatoes to other states as many of us have already taken advance payments for consignments. Over the years, we have developed good working relations with potato traders in other states. But we are losing goodwill because of the ban. Asked if export of potatoes would push up prices in Bengal further, Sarkar said around 25 lakh tonnes of the crop were lying in 440 cold storages across the state. Denying there was a shortage, he said the stocks were enough for Bengals consumption in the next two months. Cultivation of potatoes for this season has begun. The new crop will reach the markets in two months. On top of that, 25 lakh tonnes of potatoes are lying in cold storages. A huge quantity of the crop will rot if we dont export now, Sarkar said. Traders said the demand for potatoes in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu had shot up as cultivation there had been affected by Cyclone Phailin in September. The association said around 17,000 potato traders in Hooghly and Burdwan would incur a loss of Rs 250 crore if the ban was not lifted. We usually export the super S1, super six and K22 varieties of Jyoti potato to other states as their demand in Bengal is less, said Ashok Makal, the secretary of the associations Hooghly chapter. An agri-marketing department official in Burdwan, Priyadarshi Sen, said he had received a letter from the potato traders, requesting that the ban be lifted. I have forwarded the letter to my superiors, he said. Agri-marketing minister Arup Roy declined comment, saying the chief minister was looking after the department. This year, the agri-marketing department has set a target of producing 22.18 tonnes of potatoes in Burdwan and 33 lakh tonnes in Hooghly. Traders said both districts were expected to exceed the target. People protesting Bengals decision to ban potato export blocked two national highways in Odishas Balasore for three hours yesterday, stopping trucks carrying fish and other commodities to Bengal. The Odisha government said no truck carrying potatoes reached the state from Bengal today. Bengal Opposition leader Surjya Kanta Mishra of the CPM accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of inept handling of the potato crisis. The decision to stop trucks going to Odisha and Jharkhand with pototoes is a step in the wrong direction, he said."

On Sunday,the hopeful lot was visited by two eunuchs from Ambaji,Gujarat. In a 30-minute prayer session,the eunuchs showered their blessings on residents of the illegal flats and confidently warded off any evil that may be coming their way. As the two special guests were warmly escorted out of the compound,a resident of the core committee of the Campa Cola Residents Association happily added,All the tarot card readers and astrologers we approached have predicted that nothing bad will happen to us and our homes.Tasting timesWhile most visitors to the civic headquarters go to the BMC canteen for food,some standing committee corporators have objected to the quality of food served to them during the committee meetings. Although a proposal to order food for such meetings from south Mumbais posh Thackers restaurant was rejected by the commissioner,committee chairman Rahul Shewale quickly offered to pay the bills for such orders from his own pocket. At least when it comes to food,even opposition corporators seemed to be praising Shewale at a recent standing committee meeting.Building capacitiesByculla zoo authorities regularly send their animal keepers to the Delhi zoo to learn more about animal healthcare as part of capacity building. They dont receive proper training before becoming keepers. They start out as labourers and work with senior animal keepers and learn on the job, admitted a zoo official. Until a few years ago,the carrying capacity of the zoo was not a concern for officials. An official admitted that the keepers did not control the breeding of spotted deer and there were too many in a single enclosure. We once released around 200 spotted deer into the national park, he said.Potato politicsThe steep rise in potato prices has triggered an NCP versus Congress tussle within the Cabinet. Last week,a senior Cabinet minister (NCP) made a sarcastic remark,asking what happened to the fair vegetable price shops that were promised by agriculture minister Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil. The NCPs dig at Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and Vikhe-Patil was to settle scores on the onion price rise. Earlier,state and central Congress leaders had blamed NCP for onion price rise,arguing it was their political clout that controlled the biggest onion centre at Nashik.Counting on an adArecent advertisement of a telecom company seems to have left a deep impression on policemen. A young couple who went to Marine Drive police station after leaving a cellphone in a shared taxi got an unexpected reply from the officer on duty. After recounting the incident and giving their contact details,the woman asked if the phone would be recovered. The officer replied,Agar taxi driver ne ad dekha hai toh phone mil jayega. Nahi mila toh driver ne apna andar ka raavan ko nahi maara (If the taxi driver has seen the ad,you will get back your cellphone. If you dont,it implies that the driver hasnt killed the Raavan in him). The officer,having sensed that the couple did not see the funny side,hastily told a constable to note down and track the lost phones IMEI number,before adding,Agar woh Raavan nahi ban gaya,toh aapka phone mil jayega (If he hasnt turned into Raavan,you will get back your phone).Off guardLate evening on Saturday,when a woman passenger boarded a Borivali-bound train from Churchgate and found no policeman guarding the coach,she called up the Government Railway Police,who directed her to another helpline. What followed was a series of phone calls back and forth from the helpline,but no guard showed up for the next 30 minutes. After missing the train at Mumbai Central,Dadar and Bandra,two policemen finally boarded the train at Santacruz,exactly two stations before the passenger was about to alight. They kept asking me which station I was about to reach and promised each time that a policeman will board from that station. However,later they would call and ask for the upcoming station because the guard missed the train from the previous station But at least they turned up. I did not expect even one but two showed up, she said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

353,Hot potato burns fingers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131111/jsp/bihar/story_17551338.jsp,2013-11-11,Telegraph,"The cascading effect of Bengals alleged ban on the supply of potato to other states is drilling holes in the pockets of Patna residents. The price of the tuber has almost doubled in a fortnight. It was even dearer during Chhath. A couple of weeks ago, the retail price of the old variety of potato was Rs 16. Now it is selling between Rs 22 and 24 per kg. The price of the new variety is Rs 32-36 per kg. The pocket pinch was more acute during Chhath  the biggest festival of the state. On the day of Kharna (the second day of Chhath on November 7), the new variety of potato was priced at Rs 55-Rs 60 per kg. Homemaker Rinku, a resident of the Rajapul area, said: I bought potato at Rs 60 per kg on the day of Kharna. Last year, the price of the tuber during Chhath was Rs 8-Rs 10 per kg. Experts attributed the price hike to the short supply of potatoes from Bengal. The neighbouring state meets 60 per cent of the total tuber demand of the city. The rest comes from Uttar Pradesh and local cultivators. Both account for 20 per cent of the total demand. After the ban imposed by the Bengal government on the export of potatoes, the supply has dropped to 20 per cent. Even that is coming clandestinely. Since potatoes are being brought through different routes, its price has soared, said Sujeet Kumar, a wholesaler at Mithapur Mandi. Firoz Ahmed, an employee of the Patna branch of Food Corporation of India, criticised the state government for not intervening in the matter. The Bengal government has banned export of potatoes following its price hike. Why the state government is not intervening in the matter to control the situation? asked Ahmed. A senior officer in the agriculture department, requesting anonymity, said the state government had no official information on the Bengal government imposing a ban on supply of potato to other states. If it is so, the state would certainly raise the issue because rules do not permit any check on the movement of food items within the country, he said. Bihar alone is not feeling the pinch because of the Bengal governments ban on potato supply to other states. Odisha, too, is feeling the heat. Bengal-bound trucks carrying fish and other vegetables from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka via Odisha were not allowed to ply through the state on Saturday. Patna-based traders have no such blockade plans, though. We shall not do anything like that. If we do not get supply from Bengal, we shall bring potatoes from other states, Sujeet, the wholesaler at Mithapur Mandi, said. While the potato supply from Bengal has dropped by over 65 per cent, the contribution of Uttar Pradesh has also declined. It is supplying 5 per cent against the 20 per cent of the total demand. The flow of the local produce has been poor as well, said Sujeet. Amid the gloom, there is some good news. The price of potato is expected to come down within 10 days because different traders in the city are bringing stocks from Jharkhand and Haryana. Around 100 tonnes of potatoes reached the city market from different places on Sunday, marginally bringing down the price. Besides, we are expecting a good quantity of potato from Uttar Pradesh soon. Once it arrives, the price of potato will certainly drop, Sujeet added. The wholesale price of the new variety of potato on Sunday was Rs 22 per kg at Mithapur Mandi. But The Telegraph found huge disparities in its retail prices. The new variety of potato was sold at four different prices at Anta Ghat  Rs 26, Rs 28, Rs 30 and Rs 32 per kg. The retailers in the Ashiana area charged customers Rs 36 per kg. Sujeet said: The retailers are not passing on the benefit to customers. Has the high price of potato affected your budget?

Didar Singh in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury Calcutta, Nov. 11: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee today kept her date with tigers but kept members of a leading business chamber at bay. She declined to meet a visiting delegation of Ficci, led by president Naina Lal Kidwai, at Nabanna, the new state secretariat, delegating the task to finance minister Amit Mitra. When the meeting with Mitra, a former secretary-general of Ficci, was taking place at his 12th floor office in Howrah, Banerjee was two floors above. A regret letter from her office to Ficci read that the CM would be travelling today and, hence, would be unable to meet the team that included senior vice-president Sidharth Birla and vice-president Jyotsna Suri, besides some city-based industrialists. We were under the impression that the CM has left for the districts. After reaching Nabanna, we came to know that she is two floors above us. I have no idea why she did not meet us, a member of the delegation said. Officials at the state secretariat said Banerjee went to the Alipore zoo in the morning as scheduled. She was there from 11.55am to 12.20pm, inaugurating an enclosure for tigers and an aviary. The Ficci national executive committee meeting, attended by around 68 members, was taking place just across the road at a prominent hotel owned by the Tata group. Mamata reached her office at Nabanna around 12.30pm and from 2.30pm held a meeting with the members of the task force to monitor price rise and the ongoing potato crisis. The chief minister also held a meeting with senior police officers before she left for Durgapur later in the evening. Incidentally, Banerjee will be attending an event organised by the CII, a rival of Ficci, at Milan Mela on Wednesday. She was invited to Ficcis executive committee meeting last year as well but skipped the event. However, she had agreed to meet its senior members at Writers Buildings. Later, in December, she also addressed the annual general meeting of Ficci in Delhi. On being asked about Mamata refusing to meet Ficci members, secretary-general A.

357,Flowers and cakes  in cold storages  ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131112/jsp/odisha/story_17555396.jsp,2013-11-12,Telegraph,"Workers carry potatoes inside a cold storage at Aiginia in Bhubaneswar. Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Nov. 11: Cold storages in the state that are supposed to stock potato are being used for other purposes. Some have even been converted into offices by traders citing the lack of government support. Traders allege that the government is not offering them incentives, including subsidised power supply, to keep the facilities running. Two huge cold storage units at Ainginia are now storing carrots and cabbages and occasionally, even flowers, sweets and cakes because the facilities required to store potatoes are not available. Potato needs long-term storage that requires more power which, the traders were not being provided at subsidised rates. A cold storage at Chandaka Industrial Estate near Patia has been turned into an office building. Power subsidy is available only for energy-efficient cold storages. But most of us do not have the resources to re-design the facilities we set up long back, said a trader on the condition of anonymity. Sudhakar Panda, secretary, All Odisha Byabasayi Mahasangh, said government has refused to consider their repeated demands for relaxation in electricity charges for cold storage units. It (the government) needs to evolve a more rational policy, he said. He claimed that in the neighbouring Bengal, cold storage units were getting power at a low rate meant for farmers. Lack of storage space and market linkage has occasionally led to states own potato harvest being sold out to traders outside the state. Two years ago, the bumper harvest of potato in Khurda and Nayagarh was bought by traders from Bengal because local traders did not have enough storage capacity. Similarly, potato from Koraput is often carted away by traders from Andhra Pradesh. There is neither any serious effort to increase production nor the storage capacity. Had this been done, we would not be facing this scarcity today, said Panda. Director horticulture Sanjeeb Chadha said that according to the state agriculture policy 2013, for construction, expansion or modernisation of cold storage units, 60 per cent subsidy on the capital cost of the project was being provided in coastal areas and 75 per cent in case of scheduled areas. But the units must adopt energy-efficient technology. We have built an ultra-modern cold storage unit near Chandaka... Interested traders can visit the unit to know about the technology and plan modern cold storage units to avail subsidy, he said. The horticulture department is planning to add about 10 modern cold storage units across the state."
358,Clueless on pricey potatoes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131112/jsp/jharkhand/story_17555935.jsp,2013-11-12,Telegraph,"Customers bought potato at Rs 30 per kg from retail markets in Ranchi and Rs 35-Rs 40 in Jamshedpur on Monday, but the state government trotted out platitudes of everything is normal instead of tackling the crisis.Compared to a fortnight ago, the price of potatoes in Jharkhand has appreciated by 150-200 per cent. The main reason for this monstrous rise is said to be the recent decision of the Mamata Banerjee government in Bengal to stop vegetable export to neighbouring states, including Jharkhand.Asked what the Hemant Soren-led state government has done so far, political adviser to the chief minister Himanshu Shekhar Choudhary told The Telegraph: On chief ministers directive, chief secretary R.S. Sharma has talked to his Bengal counterpart (Sanjay Mitra). Sharma has been told that the Bengal government has not taken any decision to stop potato supply to Jharkhand.Choudhary added that potato was being transported from Bengal as usual.However, truck owners who ferry potato from Bengal told a different story. During the past one week, not a single potato has reached Jharkhand, said a trucker.Many trucks carrying potatoes to Jharkhand were detained at Jaipur police station near Jhalda in Bengal, said Jharkhand Truck Owners Association president Uday Shankar Ojha.Jharkhand produces 6,59,000 tonnes of potato per annum according to National Horticulture Board figures. In marked contrast, Uttar Pradesh produces 1,38,69,000 tonnes and Bengal 1,15,50,000 tonnes.However, Jharkhands per annum consumption is some 15,82,500 tonnes. Thus, Jharkhand needs to buy over nine lakh tonnes of potato from other states.We are getting potato from Uttar Pradesh now, but as the distance is much more in comparison to neighbouring Bengal, prices of the tuber wont come down drastically, said Anil Kumar Gupta, president of Potato-Onion Wholesalers Association.The wholesale rate of potato on Monday was Rs 1,100 per 50kg sack, Gupta added.Early season potato from Jharkhand farmers has reached markets but its quantity is too less to make a dent in price.But if urban customers think they are the worst-hit, they are wrong. Potato farmers have it far worse.Potato seeds are being sold at Rs 30-32 per kg. These steep prices will have a negative impact on potato sowing and final production, said Ram Prasad Mehta, vice-president of Jharkhand Agro Association. It is a matter of livelihood of thousands.Farmers may also miss the Bengal variety this year. Bengal variety and quality seeds may become scarce, admitted state agriculture secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni.To add fuel to the fire, Godda MP Nishikant Dubey has threatened to stop coal transport to Bengals Farakka, if Hemant did not take up the issue with the Mamata Banerjee government in Bengal and resolve it within a week.Earlier today (Monday), I met Godda DC K. Ravi Kumar and handed him a letter addressed to the CM.

Housewives jostled in the crowd on Monday noon to buy a kilo of subsidized onion in front of the mall at Lake Market. It reminds one of the long queues for kerosene in front of the ration shops during the load shedding days in the early Eighties.Molly Mukherjee came all the way from her Kalighat residence to buy the onion selling at Rs 36 a kilo in front of the Lake Mall. Jagori Sinha dropped by on her way back home with her daughter, a student of National High School for Girls, to buy the subsidized tuber. The desperation becomes evident when one takes a peek inside the Lake Market. Onions are selling at Rs 70 a kilo. Yet the quality is not up to the mark. Physiotherapist Rita Das was shouting at the top of her voice, accusing the shop owner for giving her bad quality onions the day before despite the high price.The scene is different for potatoes. Coming under pressure from the Mamata Banerjee government, no retailer dares to sell the 'jyoti' variety above Rs 13, but the stocks are meagre. Haggle over the potato quantity,A shop owner also points to the 'chandramukhi' variety selling at Rs 18 or Rs 20 a kilo. ""We are buying the 'chandramukhi' variety because truckloads of government monitored 'jyoti' potato reach the market late. If you compare prices of other vegetables, brinjal, cabbage or tomato, I have no choice but to opt for the 'chandramukhi' potato,"" said Nandita Das.Masuma Wahab from Park Circus isn't going to the corporation market. She instead goes to the neighbouring Quest Mall to buy her weekly potato stocks at Rs 13. ""There is no restriction on the quantity you buy. Onions are also selling at Rs 59 a kilo,"" Wahab said. Nasreen Siddque, her neighbour, also came to the mall to buy rice, dal and sugar. ""Here prices are cheaper than the kirana stores. You don't have to queue up for your purchase,"" said Siddique. The message has reached households. Food Bazar at Baguiati is facing a rush from consumers while the Food Bazar at City Centre II has run out of stocks.But why is it so when potatoes procured by the mall and wholesale traders are from the same 416 state cold storages? ""Malls make contract purchase. They float tenders inviting traders to supply the tuber for at least six months at rates fixed beforehand. So, when prices soar in the open market, malls can keep the price low if they want,"" a potato trader said.Dig a little into the potato supply chain, it will surprise you more. Fact is Bengal had a bumper potato yield this year as much as 1 crore tonnes. Potato prices were low during January because of the huge production when traders chose to send out potatoes to neighbouring states. The government didn't keep a tab on the inter-state trade then. The outgo to other states helped traders to come out of the excess supply situation in September. Stocks started dipping due to the untimely shower all over the country that took a toll on the early variety of the tuber grown in Bankura, Midnapore, Udaynarayanpur and Mashagram apart from those in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.The Mamata Banerjee government pressed the panic button when falling stocks in state cold storage indicated that Bengal can't sustain the demand for 4 lakh tonnes of potatoes a month with the remaining stocks.The embargo on potato export has brought Bengal back to a comfortable situation. According to government, cold storages have a stock of 13.7 lakh tonnes of tuber that will take care of the state's demand till January before the new tuber reaches market in February.But then the government ban is having an effect on prices of commodities coming from other states. Egg is selling at Rs 4.50 each and fish for Rs 250 a kilo. BJP state vice-president of Baleswar district in Odisha Arun Beij has threatened to stop lorries carrying egg and fish to Bengal from Tuesday if his state doesn't get potato. ""We gave an ultimatum to the executive magistrate on Saturday to arrange for potato. Else we will stop trucks at Jaleswar Road,"" Beij said.Chief secretary of Bengal Sanjay Mitra rubbished such argument. ""The government has no information about such threat. It is also not proper to relate the embargo on potato with prices on other commodities. We are concerned with potato and onion prices. The government has set up a committee exclusively for these two. Potato prices have stabilised by now,"" the chief secretary said."

He said several police officers, including from IB and other wings of police, had talked to him in Patna. He also claimed the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley, was asked by IB officials to cancel the rally. He inquired from a woman police officer of Bihar police whether they had any contingency plan to safely evacuate the leaders and the audience from Gandhi Maidan. The woman officer said she would inform him after talking to her seniors, but she never returned.Modi said it was the duty of the senior officers of Bihar police to inform Narendra Modi and other senior party leaders about the safety and security measures. They did not give any advice whether to proceed with the rally or return. They remained silent.Referring to rising potato prices in Bihar, Modi said the state government should negotiate with the West Bengal government to lift ban on supply of potato from that state. He even suggested that like Odisha, which has banned the supply of fish and vegetable to West Bengal, Bihar should also take some retaliatory measure against West Bengal."

Cuttack and other cities in the state also saw people standing in long queues to buy salt. The police had to intervene to control the mob. The situation came in handy for traders who lost no time in raising the price to Rs 40 a kg at places.Food supplies and consumer welfare secretary Madhusudan Padhi attributed the scramble for salt to ""false reports published in a section of the press"".""The rumour is fanned by the media,"" said Padhi, adding, ""There is absolutely not an iota of truth in the reports. Salt in abundant quantity is available in the state. There is no need to panic.""The government allayed fears by making frequent announcements over the loudspeaker at different markets. An official media release issued here said, ""Some persons with vested interest have started a rumour about salt shortage."" It warned ""stringent action"" against such elements and asked people to inform in the toll free number (155335) about traders selling salt at higher price. Odisha, like potato and many other essential items, depends on the import of salt. The state annually consumes around 2.75 lakh tonnes of ordinary iodised salt mostly from Gujarat and Rajasthan and about 1.5 lakh tonnes of refined iodised salt.Amid this panic buying, the potato crisis persisted with no regular arrival of stocks from neighbouring West Bengal that meets nearly 90% of the state's estimated 10 lakh tonnes of annual needs. The open market price of potato crossed Rs 50 in Bhubaneswar during the day, while it shot up to Rs 80 in Cuttack.The scarcity of potato had started after the West Bengal government stopped its export more than a week ago.

We hope normalcy will return in the next three days,"" the secretary said.Sources in the food supplies department said officials are wary of raiding potato hoarders because the item is not in the essential commodity list. ""We cannot raid traders. We can only caution them but that has little impact,"" admitted a senior official."

It means employees will have no special feelings for Raja Festival as it will overlap with two obvious holidays.Some employees associations are preparing to move government demanding allotment of additional holidays as many festival and commemorative days are falling on Sundays.Cost of being vegetarianIncrease in price of most vegetables including that of potatoes and onions has brought in changes in the dishes cooked in several households. It may be noted that during holy month of Kartik most families become vegetarian for religious reasons.But this year becoming vegetarian during this month has become a financial burden as most vegetables are being sold at more than Rs. 60 per kg and price of potatoes and onions are at Rs. 40 per kg.Many families have started to realise that it is easy to satisfy most family members by cooking fish, eggs or small amount of chicken meat. So, vegetarian food is being cooked for only those members of the family who for their religious belief are hell bent to remain vegetarian during this month.For rest of family members a single non-vegetarian dish is being cooked.As per housewivesm it is easy to satisfy children with single non-vegetarian dish while for a vegetarian meal at least two curries have to be cooked which puts pressure on the purse. In some other families, a non-vegetarian dish is being procured from some hotel to avoid cooking at home for religious reasons.(Satyasundar Barik & Sib Kumar Das)"

Lalu is not in Bihar  he is serving time in Ranchis Birsa Munda jail in a fodder scam case  while the potato may not have completely gone missing from samosas, its portion has surely shrunk. With the tuber, a must in almost all dishes, becoming pricey, shops and hotels selling samosas have either jacked up prices of the all-time favourite snack or are going easy the key ingredient. The samosas, which used to cost Rs 5 a piece just a few days ago, are now being sold at Rs 6 at roadside shops in Bariatu. A few popular sweet shops and restaurants have also increased the rates to Rs 10 a piece for samosas and Rs 55-Rs 70 per plate for aloo chaat and samosa chaat. Kya kare? Aloo ka daam itna badh gaya hain (What can we do? Prices of potatoes have gone up so much), said Mani Ram, a samosa seller near Jai Prakash Nagar Colony. On Monday, a kg of potatoes was selling for Rs 30 a kg in the capitals retail market. Many eateries like Prem Sweets near Plaza Chowk are doling out samosas in less number. Owner Deepak Sharma said: We are yet to increase prices of samosas and other potato delicacies, but have asked our staff to prepare the snack in less quantities. On an average, we prepare 400 pieces of samosas every day, but now we are going to reduce it to 200 pieces. Or else, our business will suffer.

But now, we are planning to bring down the number as we cannot take a risk by increasing the prices and lose our permanent customers, he added. The worst-hit are the small snack sellers near Kutchery Chowk, who are not in a position to effect a further hike as they had increased the rate from Rs 3 per piece to Rs 5 some time back.

It was expected that the prices would go down as the demand for vegetables generally goes down after a festival. The rising prices have forced many residents to restructure their budgets.The prices of potatoes and onion continue to range between Rs 30 to Rs 40 per kg while those of leafy vegetables are priced at a minimum of Rs 15 per kg.Officials of the city-based agriculture produce market committee (APMC), the wholesale market for vegetables, said prices of vegetables continue to remain high mainly due to poor supply. The local production of vegetables is now sufficient to meet the demand in the city as well as some other urban pockets in the district, including Ichalkaranji, Jaisinghpur and Gadhinglaj. Kolhapur is a highly irrigated district and farmers have a tendency to produce sugarcane, which is a cash crop. Though vegetables are a good source of income for farmers as they can earn money by selling vegetables on alternate weeks, most farmers in the district have not developed the business acumen to do so. Most vegetable growers have minor land holdings or do not have a steady financial background to invest in cash crop cultivation, the officials added.Kolhapur receives its supply of vegetables from Sangli and Karnataka, while potatoes and tomatoes are supplied from the Agra market as well as the Pune APMC.Ragini Chaugule, a resident of Rajarampuri, said, ""Vegetable prices are as high as they were before Diwali. I am spending around Rs 100 even if I buy three-four vegetables in a week. Potatos are being sold at Rs 30 to Rs 35 per kg while tomatoes are being sold at Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg."" Interestingly, prices in shopping malls are lower by Re 1 or Rs 2 per kg, but many families said it is not economical to go to a mall only to purchase vegetables. ""There are only three or four malls in the city. So it is not economical to go there merely to buy vegetables,"" Chaugule added.Kapil Teerth is one of the markets in the city where vegetable growers sell their produce. Vendors have not reduced vegetable prices though they are selling almost 50 to 80 kg of all types of vegetables. A small farmer, Shankar Patil, said, ""I have a 10-guntha (10,000 sq ft) agricultural land, which I use for vegetable production. I have to keep the prices high to recover my travel and daily expenses over fuel and food. The prices of seeds are also high, so I cannot sell vegetables at a lower price though the market is sluggish. I cannot sustain my business if I do not earn more than my input cost."" Patil regularly sells his vegetables such as spinach, fenugreek and coriander to consumers at the Kapil Teerth market. He was selling a bunch of his produce for Rs 12.Shamrao Powar, who runs a food joint in the city, said, ""I have tied up with some farmers and vendors to ensure a smooth supply of vegetables. Such tie ups helps me to book vegetables at a fixed price, wherein I can save a couple of rupees per kg. But the rates have remained high for more than a week and I have to quote a higher price to suppliers. Potatoes, tomatoes and onions are essential items used in several dishes.""Powar added, ""I used to place an order of 80 to 100 kg of vegetables along with 50 to 70 bunches of leafy vegetables earlier. It was sufficient for me to run the business for a week. Now, I have cut the order to 70 to 80 kg of vegetables and I stop cooking if the stock is exhausted before the next delivery. It is unaffordable to buy vegetables from the open market and serve customers. I cannot change the rates of dishes even if there are changes in vegetable prices."""

Onion rates have already been high since last few months and now prices of tomatoes have also increased, and also of other vegetables such as potatoes and cucumber. In some cases, like garlic, there has been a three time rise in rates since last month. Even prices of ginger have almost doubled since last year. It has become extremely difficult to make ends meet, considering we need almost 80 kg of vegetables everyday,"" he said, adding he is not expecting prices to come down soon.Jadhav, however, said the price rise at this time of the year is an annual trend. ""We have been seeing this trend of price rise every year after Diwali and a correction doesn't happen before February-March, so I am bracing for the time ahead. Considering we can neither compromise on quality nor raise prices for short time periods, it's just about survival till then,"" he said.Consumers across the city are feeling the pinch of the escalating prices of vegetables, which have gone up by almost 50% over the last ten days. Prices of vegetables like cauliflower, ladyfinger, bottle gourd, brinjal, tondli and even gavarphali have shot up to around Rs 60 per kg in several parts of the city over the weekend, up from the average Rs 40 per kg they were commanding till last week.Shopkeepers say they are only passing on the rate they are being charged with in the wholesale market. ""There is a shortage of supply is reaching Market Yard, because of which wholesalers are charging us more. We also need to keep a margin for spoilage, which is around four kg out of every 50 kg. We end up earning hardly anything,"" said vegetable vendor Chandan Gupta.Officers in-charge of the wholesale market say it could take at least a month for prices to stabilise. ""Large chunks of even the new crop have been spoilt this year because of heavy and untimely rains. Supply is substantially down, which is pushing up the prices.

After a week, they will sell the delicacies for Rs 10 per piece. The steep rise in potato prices has cut into our profit margin. I had a daily sale of over Rs 8,000 from my unit and a profit of Rs 500. However, the cooking cost is over Rs 9,000 at the moment while sales figure remain the same. I had resisted the price hike till now, as it is bound to affect customer footfall. But, now we have no option, said Rahul. Hotels and restaurants have also adopted the wait-and-watch policy. We do not want to rise the prices of dishes having potatoes in them abruptly and face the wrath of customers. But potatoes are an integral part of Indian cuisine, and if the present trend continues, we will have to increase prices of some of the dishes, said Prabhakar Singh, a senior functionary of Jamshedpur Hoteliers Association. Prodded about the possible hike percentage and time, Prabhakar said it would come to about 15-20 in a week or so. Several shops in capital Ranchi have already increased samosa prices. Roadside eating joints in Bariatu are selling the all-time favourite snack for Rs 6 a piece. A few popular sweet shops and restaurants have hikes the rates to Rs 10 a piece for samosas and Rs 55-Rs 70 per plate for aloo chaat and samosa chaat."

Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee Bhubaneswar, Nov. 11: Salt seems to be going the potato way. Even as the state struggles to overcome an unprecedented potato shortage, salt, too, seems to be on the verge of vanishing with apparent scarcity pushing up its prices. Though the government claimed that massive buying of salt followed rumours of its shortage, people complained that it had indeed vanished from the market. Some people, who managed to buy salt today, paid as much as Rs 70 for one kilogram. When I heard about the shortage, I rushed to the market to buy a packet. I was surprised to see long queues in front of many shops late at night. I had to pay Rs 35 for a kg of a popular brand of salt, which normally costs Rs 16. Within a few minutes the shopkeeper told others waiting in the line that the stock was over, said Nayapalli resident Satyasundar Naik. The situation became grave this morning with people queuing up at grocers shops across the city to purchase salt. Some were seen buying more than 5kg of salt at a time. Consequently, shopkeepers hiked the prices. Later in the day, the food supply and consumer welfare department issued a statement, urging people not to pay attention to rumours of salt shortage. The government is taking stringent action against such rumour mongers, said the statement. Retailers across the city said that when people started buying salt in bulk, the stocks got exhausted. However, Sudhakar Panda, secretary of the All Odisha Traders Association, said that when he got to know about the rumours, he had immediately informed the district collector to appeal to the people not to resort to buy salt under any apprehension. We have enough stocks for more than a month. We do not know who spread these rumours, said Panda. The city needs around 10,000 tonnes of salt every month. Sources said the rumours started from Nayagarh district last night. Salt superintendent for Odisha Harekrushna Agarwal said the state needed three lakh tonnes of salt every year while it produced 30,000 tonnes a year. Most of the salt requirement here is met by supply from Alwar in Rajasthan, Tutikoran in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. The current situation must be the handiwork of a handful of traders. Action should be taken against such people, said Agarwal. He was surprised how such rumours spread despite 16,000 tonnes of salt stocked in Ganjam district. We have instructed all the district collectors to intervene in the market. There is no short supply of salt and people should not panic. We will take steps against traders behind this, said civil supply and consumer welfare secretary M.S. Padhi. Salt was sold at normal rates in Bhubaneswar this afternoon following the governments appeal. But, the situation is yet to be normal in some other districts. Potato was sold in the city today after four days, albeit at a high rate. Ten trucks loaded with the tuber reached Bhubaneswar last night. The state government managed to procure 17 trucks from Bengal, of which 10 were sent to Bhubaneswar and seven to Cuttack. Civil supply officials were present today at Aiginia potato stockyard along with police officials to thwart any law-and-order problems when the vegetable was provided to the traders. We got potato at Rs 28 to 30 a kg from the wholesale market and we have been selling it accordingly, said Ratnakar Sahu, a trader at Unit-IV. One kilogram of potato sold at Rs 40 at several parts of the city this afternoon. Padhi said the Bengal government would take a decision today regarding supply of potato to Odisha. The neighbouring state has restricted the supply. We expect the Bengal government to take a positive decision. Besides, through National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India, we are planning to procure potato from Ranchi in Jharkhand and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, said Padhi."

Following restricted supply, the price of potato has shot up in Jharkhand. Potatoes, which were earlier sold at Rs 14-16, are being sold at Rs 25 on Monday.Pasupatinath Singh, the MP of Dhanbad constituency,said Jharkhand government should retaliate. ""If West Bengal is not supplying potatoes to Jharkhand, the supply of coal and other items to them should be stopped. Let the factories in West Bengal shut down suffering coal crisis,"" he said.Many of the leaders also blamed that Banerjee decision in this regard is against national sovereignty.It is harming Banerjee popularity as a national leader. MLA, Chandankyari, Umakant Rajak demanded from Banerjee to lift up the restriction immediately.Chandankyari is neighbouring constituency situated adjacent to Purulia. Rajak said that they are forced to restrict things going to West Bengal, if potato supply is not restored soon. ""It is against national sovereignty. Potato has created difference between neighbouring states,"" said Rajak.The firebrand legislature of Dumri, Jagarnath Mahto asked the state government to come up strongly against such unethical move of Banerjee and restrict supply of electricity and water to West Bengal.""Bokaro boast two power plants of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), of which electricity produced is being supplied to West Bengal to meet power demand there.""Besides the water released from Tenughat Dam quenches thirst of people of West Bengal. We should stop electricity and water supply to West Bengal,"" said Mahto, who is a leader from ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and said to be very close to chief minister Hemant Soren.Bokaro, MLA, Samresh Singh also raised voice against Banerjee imposed restriction over potato supply. He said that the step is not fair and has raised the cost of potato in state. This ultimately made residents suffer. ""Banerjee should rethink and restore the supply. This move has maligned her national image,"" said Singh.Meanwhile, Congress leader, Madhavlal Singh and MLA from Gomia constituency whose border also touches Purulia district said, like West Bengal supply potato to the state, Jharkhand also in large quantity supply green vegetables to it.""Banerjee should think that, if we started imposing ban on supply of our products to Bengal, they will suffer more,"" he said."

""Though some of the provisions of the modalities which make it mandatory to obtain the nod of department secretary for transport of every truck load of potatoes to other states unrealistic, no neighbouring state can compel West Bengal to change its stand,"" he said. While Jharkhand government has requested Bengal to reconsider the decision price of potato has touched Rs.30-35 per kg back home.Pawan Kumar Sharma, secretary general-FJCCI, said such decisions (of the Bengal government) could hamper relationship between states because traders in Jharkhand would be encouraged to stop transporting minerals and other commodities required in Bengal.""The white potato is chiefly produced in Bengal whereas domestic production of potato in Jharkhand is sufficient to fulfil little more than 60 % of the demands."

374,HOT POTATO,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131113/jsp/opinion/story_17557850.jsp,2013-11-13,Telegraph,"West Bengal is not an island. This is a self-evident truth in terms of geography. But there seems to be a misconception that it can be treated like an island, and through regulations, isolated from other parts of the country. The chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, angered by the rise in the price of potatoes, took two drastic steps. One, she regulated the price of potatoes, thus forcing retailers to sell at a price fixed by her. And two, she prohibited the movement of potatoes to other states. She had probably miscalculated the consequences of these measures. Potatoes disappeared from the market and buyers had to queue up to get rationed supplies at fixed prices. Bazaars in West Bengal suddenly acquired features of stores in erstwhile Soviet Russia. The prices of other vegetables sky-rocketed because of the restrictions on the price and the scarcity of potatoes. Another impact was even more significant. On the borders of West Bengal and Odisha, trucks carrying fish and onions into West Bengal were stopped in protest against the banning of the movement of potatoes from West Bengal. The chief minister of Jharkhand very aptly pointed out that West Bengal is not a self-sufficient state and is dependent on Jharkhand for the supply of large quantities of vegetables. Other chief ministers of eastern Indian states and elsewhere could have made the same point. Unknowingly, Ms Banerjee may have let loose a boomerang. India is one unified market. This means the free movement of goods and services at prices determined by unregulated market forces. It is logical to expect that enforcing a fixed price will lead to hoarding and thus to a scarcity in the market. The banning of movements of a commodity to other states is always self-defeating since it opens up the possibility of other states hitting back. It also defies the fact that India is a single market. West Bengal or any other state cannot suddenly decide that it is not part of this system. The so-called potato crisis could have been better dealt with in the short run by requisitioning wholesale stocks. In the medium term, it could be averted with some foresight. The late rains delayed sowing and thus the availability of the new crop, so traders monitored the release of potatoes to the market. This could have been avoided. Having failed to do these, the West Bengal government reacted with a populist knee jerk. The problem may not have disappeared."

378,Card link to potato crisis,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131113/jsp/bengal/story_17561363.jsp,2013-11-13,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Nov. 12: Non-availability of Kisan Credit Cards needed for bank loans has forced potato farmers to sell their cold storage bonds  receipts for storing stocks  to intermediaries, giving the latter the chance to control the market. Following the recent potato crisis, the state government analysed the supply chain from cold storage units to retail markets and found deficiencies in the system that led to the shortage of the tuber and the consequent price rise. In Bengal, each cold storage has to reserve 40 per cent of its capacity for farmers so that they can stock their produce till they feel they would get the proper price from sale. But because of lack of loans, farmers are often forced to sell their cold storage bonds when prices are low to reinvest in their fields. The intermediaries wait for such opportunities. Within months, most bonds are sold to the intermediaries and they start controlling the supply of potatoes to the market, a senior agriculture department official said. Senior officials said holding the intermediaries responsible for the potato crisis would not be the correct analysis. We should address the problem instead of passing the buck. The intermediaries are actually taking advantage of the faulty policies of the state government, an official said. The farmers keep potatoes in cold storage units in February or March but are forced to sell their bonds by July or August to invest in kharif (monsoon) crops. Had the government ensured farm loans for them, they could have stored their produce till the time they got the proper price, an official said. Only nine lakh of Bengals one crore farmers have Kisan Credit Cards, which are essential to get bank loans. There are at least 15 lakh farmers in Hooghly, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Bankura and Birbhum alone who cultivate potato. Nationalised banks provide Kisan Credit Cards on recommendations from the government. Officials said successive governments in Bengal did little to ensure that the farmers got the cards. The Trinamul government had requested banks to make available cards even if farmers did not have land documents. But banks are often reluctant to do so, the officials said. The officials said successive governments did not take proper initiatives to make fertilisers available at subsidised rates to farmers. Many farmers are forced to take loans from intermediaries to cultivate their plots. Often, the farmers have no option but to sell their cold storage bonds to repay the loans, an official said. The state government also does not have the network to ensure that the cold storage units kept aside 40 per cent of their space for farmers, the officials said. We have received several complaints that farmers have been denied storage facilities. But neither the erstwhile Left Front government nor the Trinamul dispensation took any initiative to track the activities of cold storage owners, another official said."

Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee Bhubaneswar, Nov. 12: The availability of potato has gone up with more stock reaching the state today, but prices remain high. An official said the Bengal government had softened its stance on potato supply to Odisha. While 10 trucks of potatoes reached Bhubaneswar from Bengal yesterday and seven to Cuttack, 30 more potato-laden trucks today arrived in the city. However, the tuber is still being sold at Rs 40 a kg or more. Yesterday, I sold five sacks of potato very quickly, as people had been waiting for it for the past four days. Today, I got equal number of potato sacks from the wholesale stockyard at Aiginia. The rate at the stockyard is between Rs 26 and Rs 30 a kg and we sell in the retail market accordingly, said Sumant Sahu, a retail trader at Ruchika market. Residents were relieved after the tuber was available again at local shops. Despite the high price  Rs 45 a kg on the city outskirts and Rs 40 in the city  people appeared happy that they were at least getting it. The high price forced many people to buy potato from the Udyan Fresh and government shops where it is being sold at Rs 22 a kg. Buyers today thronged the 11 Udyan Fresh shops and 140 government-recognised kiosks. We prefer to buy it from the fair-price shops because the price is at least Rs 15 less here, said Old Town resident Sangram Senapati. A trader said the situation would become normal with the arrival of potato from other states. Sudhakar Panda, secretary of the Odisha Traders Association said 200 trucks of potato today reached the state from Bengal and 30 of them had been supplied to Bhubaneswar. With the softening of stance of the Bengal government, we are procuring potato from there and hope to continue it. Besides, we are in talks with the Uttar Pradesh government because it is one of the leading potato producers. We are also in search of other sources. This will continue till the cultivation peaks up here, said Panda. The traders are planning to procure around 20,000 sacks of potato from Agra. But they would take at least two days to reach the state. Panda said that after this supply worked out, the rates would fall. Besides, the production of new potatoes will also reduce the price. Civil supplies and consumer welfare secretary M.S. Padhi said the potato situation was now under control. We have asked the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India to procure 400 tonnes of potatoes everyday for three days from Uttar Pradesh. This will be provided to six cities. Then we will review the situation, and if need be, procure more, said Padhi. The prices of other vegetables remain high.

People looted three more weekly haats in Malda on Tuesday, triggering panic among vegetable traders who have threatened to call a strike unless they get police protection.Those who looted Dharampur , Achintola and Balupur bazaars on Tuesday are ordinary people driven to desperation by the unbridled rise in vegetable prices. It's also an indication that the government has failed to restore confidence among buyers.On Monday, villagers had looted the Sovanagar haat in Malda after a quarrel with potato sellers who refused to sell at the government rate of Rs 13 a kg. The fire spread to Dharampur with people ransacking stalls and running off with all the vegetables they could lay their hands on. The administration, which had brushed off the Sovanagar looting, tried to play down the Dharampur incident as well, calling it a mere scuffle between a seller and some customers . ""Some potatoes and spinach were snatched, which was blown out of proportion ,"" said an official.Traders reacted angrily, accusing the administration of being ignorant or deliberately suppressing the looting. While the blame-game was on, two more haats - Achintola and Balupur in Ratua - were looted. A worried administration has called a meeting on Wednesday.The trigger in Dharampur was the same as Sovanagar - potato being sold at Rs 20. Newly harvested potato was selling for a whopping Rs 60 a kilo and onion at Rs 80. Even the humble kochu (yam) was priced at Rs 45 per kg and raw banana at Rs 5 a piece. To top it all, there was little of everything. People flew into a rage and started looting the market. Some sellers began to hide their goods but the frenzied mob snatched everything. Even bundles of spinach were torn from hand to hand. It was a free for all.Police from Manikchak reached around 9.30am but there wasn't anything left. Traders alleged that vegetables worth Rs 2-3 lakh were looted. In Balupur and Achintola , the loss was Rs 1 lakh each. Worryingly, clashes broke out at Achintola, and police had to lathicharge the looters.SP Kalyan Mukherjee said police are trying to hold negotiations to clear the ""misunderstanding between sellers and buyers"" . District magistrate G Kiran Kumar was not willing to acknowledge the lootings as ""big incidents"" . ""They were blown out of proportion . We have already taken measures to keep prices in check and have opened two stalls in each block for selling vegetables.

The inflation rates for rural and urban areas for October 2013 were 10.11% and 10.20%.Final inflation rates for rural and urban areas for September 2013 were 9.71% and 9.93%.The key driver for the surge were vegetable prices which shot up 45.67% year-on-on year in October. Vegetable prices have remained a pressure point for several months, with onion, tomato and potato prices spiralling due to supply problems.Eggs, fish and meat rose an annual 11.78% in October, fruits shot up 12.84% year-on-year. Cereal prices rose 12.05%. The overall food and beverage inflation in October stood at 12.56% year-on-year, highlighting the stress on the household budget as food is a vital chunk of monthly expenses.Stubborn retail inflation along with pressure on wholesale prices makes it difficult for the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates and ease the pain of households reeling under the burden of soaring prices and costly monthly payouts on mortgages and vehicle loans.RBI governor Raghuram Rajan in his latest monetary policy review has said that he expects retail inflation to remain above 9% for the remaining part of the year. The RBI has raised interest rates in the face of price pressures. ""On inflation, both wholesale and consumer price inflation are likely to remain elevated in the months ahead, warranting an appropriate policy response,"" the RBI said in its review last month.Food inflation has remained a policy challenge for the past three years, prompting calls for urgent measures to raise supplies and remove the bottlenecks but progress has been limited."
383,"No let-up in prices of onion, potato, tomato",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/No-let-up-in-prices-of-onion-potato-tomato/articleshow/25664320.cms,2013-11-13,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: The government's claim that prices of onion, potato and tomato would moderate soon have fallen flat. While price of onion is hovering around Rs 70 a kg, tomato prices are Rs 60-70 in most north Indian cities. Potato prices have increased in almost all cities barring Ludhiana and Amritsar.A comparison of retail prices in the past 12 days based on details provided by the price monitoring cell of consumer affairs ministry shows that tomato prices increased by Rs 18 per kg in Delhi while potato prices rose Rs 4 per kg. Prices of onion, tomato and potato went up in other cities including Chandigarh, Lucknow, Kanpur, Dehradun and Indore. However, retail prices of these three remained stable in Mumbai.This is despite government functionaries, including food and consumer affairs minister K V Thomas, saying prices would start moderating after Diwali. Even Centre's advisory to states to crack down on hoarders and middlemen making a killing has not worked.Sources said while shooting tomato prices was due to insistent rain that damaged farm produce in many parts of the country, particularly in hill states and eastern region, traders were making maximum profit. This is evident from the fact that on Tuesday, while the wholesale tomato price in Delhi was Rs 33 per kg, the retail price was Rs 60. In Amritsar, it was no different. Against wholesale prices of Rs 35 per kg, tomato was selling at Rs 80 per kg in the retail market. However, both wholesale and retail potato prices have remained constant in cities of Punjab.Government sources said that potato prices are on the rise as farmers in potato producing regions have put a check on the harvest so that they keep getting good prices for some more time. ""Last year they had to sell potato at less than a Re per kg and farmers even threw tonnes on roads for not getting good price,"" said an official.Meanwhile, prices of almost all vegetables have increased significantly in eastern parts of the country after Phailin which destroyed vegetable crops. By now the fresh produce such as cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal should have reached the market. But now farmers are going for fresh saplings and it will take at least two months for new produce to be available in the market."
384,Govt nixes plea to ease potato curbs,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131114/jsp/bengal/story_17564739.jsp,2013-11-14,Telegraph,"Sanjay Mitra Calcutta, Nov. 13: The Bengal government today turned down a request by cold storage owners to relax the ban on export of potatoes although they claimed 5 lakh tonnes faced the risk of rotting. At a meeting chaired by chief secretary Sanjay Mitra and attended by agriculture secretary Subrata Biswas and agriculture adviser to the chief minister, Pradip Majumdar, the owners appealed to the government that the ban be relaxed so that a portion of the stock in the states 450-odd storages could be released. The government banned the export of potatoes after a shortage pushed up prices of the tuber in the state. At a rally in Birbhum yesterday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee instructed cold storage owners to stack potatoes till December 15, extending the November 30 deadline. Today, Jyoti variety potatoes were not available in most Calcutta markets because of a lax in government vigil, officials said. The more expensive Chandramukhi variety sold at Rs 25 a kilo. An official who attended the meeting at Nabanna today said the West Bengal Cold Storage Association mentioned that around 5 lakh tonnes of the 13 lakh tonnes of potatoes in cold storage units would rot if some relaxation on export was not offered. The operators said the bulk of the existing stock would rot as the fresh crop was expected to arrive in December. The official said the cold storage owners were clearly told that there would be no relaxation till the crisis was over. There could be more stringent measures against export if those adopted so far do not yield results, he said. The official said the government was in no position to look into the demands of the cold storage owners till the situation became normal. Besides clamping down on export, the government has also fixed the wholesale price of potatoes at Rs 11 a kg and the retail rate at Rs 13 a kg. Last week, potato traders in Hooghly and Burdwan, the two biggest producers of the crop in Bengal, had appealed to the government to lift the ban as they have taken advance payments for consignments. The Bengal government has sent teams of officials to Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to strike deals for the import of potato seeds for the next season. The state has decided to procure seeds for distribution to farmers to ensure better cultivation of potatoes."

Though no fresh incident of market looting was reported on Wednesday, traders in many parts of the state downed shutters fearing backlash from consumers.The government sub-committee set up to keep a tab on potato prices took stock of the situation at a meeting held at Nabanna on Wednesday. Sources said cold storage owners have sought police protection when the stock is sent to markets. Truckloads of potato were seen waiting near the Tea Board in the city on Wednesday. They have also urged the government to relax the ban on potato exports to other states because the 13.7 lakh metric tonne of stock in the 416 cold storages is enough to take care of the state's aggregate demand for potato till January.Looting in Malda pormpted the district administration to hold a meeting with potato traders to allay fears. While representatives of Malda Chamber of Commerce sought security of the retailers, local MLA and social welfare minister Sabitri Mitra tried to pass the buck on the opposition. Police have arrested one in connection with Tuesday's looting. ""We have asked cold storage owners to release 15,700 quintal potato by Novemeber 20. They were trying to delay it,"" Mitra said.Looting was reported at Shobhanagar bazaar in Malda on Monday and three more at Dharampur, Achin Tola and Balupur. Niyamatpur Hat, around 50 km from Malda town, was kept closed on Wednesday fearing public rage. While no looting was reported, hooligans tried to rampage Nawabganj market in Old Malda.Looting was reported on Tuesday from Radhanagar haat in Kulpi in South 24-Parganas where a retailer was selling potato at Rs 16 per kg. Buyers, unwilling to pay more than Rs 13 per kg, got into a heated exchange of words and looted the shop. The market was shut on Wednesday.Similarly, police had to intervene after buyers got into a scuffle with a retailer in Deganga. A potato retailer lodged a complaint with Haroa police. The trader alleged that potato was looted from his van as he was unloading bags. ""We are keeping an eye on the developments across the markets in the district,"" said Bhaskar Mukherjee, additional SP, Barasat.Wholesalers in Burdwan have sought police protection while the crop is unloaded from storages. Madan Mondal, secretary of Burdwan Sadar Aloo Byabsayee Samiti, said: ""We will release potato till the end of this month under police supervision."" While no looting has been reported, police have seized 50 truckloads of potato in a week from the Duburdihi check post at Asansol-Jharkhand border.There was a surge in potato prices on Wednesday with wholesale price at the cold storage point touching Rs 700 per 50-kg bag. ""Prices increased after the state government softened its stance on potato export and said traders can export after getting permission from the state government,"" said Rampada Pal, president of the West Bengal Cold Storage Association.Vigilance has been stepped up in districts like Birbhum which share their border with other states. While traders said there are no reports of large-scale potato exports, traders from neighbouring districts are buying from the local markets. ""The stock in cold storages is sufficient to meet the domestic demand for next one and a half months,"" said Pawan Agarwal, a cold storage owner in Birbhum.At the retail-end, Jyoti variety continued to command a higher price across the state. ""Traders who have got the state government's nod have started sending potato to neighbouring districts over the last two days,"" Pal said. ""Many retailers have stopped selling potato for the time being. Who is going to risk his business,"" asked Biswajit Das, a vegetable retailer at Chanpadanga market in Hooghly."

Administrative delay in handling the crisis has now left the government in a difficult catch 22 situation wherein consumer's interest clash with that of the traders. However, the entire fiasco is proving dear to the hapless farmers in the state.With fresh produce ready to hit the local market soon, the government officials are undecided how to tackle the crisis. On Wednesday, farmers across are village mandi in Ranchi and its adjacent areas were agitated over state government's decision to restrict transport of potato outside state, a measure to bring down the price of the vegetable. State agriculture secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni had directed the agriculture marketing boards to discourage traders from selling potato outside state so that the new crop is available at a reasonable price. If the government's decision is implemented and transport of potatoes gets restricted, the traders are likely to suffer loss to the tune of Rs.10-12 per Kg.On Wednesday fresh batch of potatoes were sold at Rs.24-25 per kg in the locale market whereas price of the old batch continued to be Rs.30 per kg. President of Jharkhand chamber of commerce and industries, Vikas Singh blamed it on the administration for its failure to check price rise. ""If Bengal chief minister Mamta Banerjee is ready to face all around criticism and still help people living there by controlling the prices why is Jharkhand government hesitant in doing so,"" he asked. Directing the traders' association at Pandra-based Ranchi agriculture produce marketing board to issue their statement and clarify the situation at hand, he said that the consumers are under the wrong impression that traders are making money out of this crisis. ""It is beyond the common man's understanding why is the government allowing traders to sell local potato outside when there is a demand within the state,"" he said.While farmers are selling potato at Rs.20 per kg to the traders they in turn would get Rs.22 per Kg from the local wholesale market whereas the traders outside state are ready to pay Rs.27-28 per kg."

Though it was difficult for them to understand initially, later they were satisfied that at least somebody bothered about the crisis the customers are facing due to price rise.It was the opposition leaders' day out at the Ganeshguri market to refute the remarks of Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi on price hike.""It's good that at least somebody is bothered. But it would be better if some from the ruling party - may be the chief minister himself or the food and civil supplies minister - comes here to check the reality,"" said a vegetable vendor at the market.BJP state president Sarbananda Sonowal, who along with a few leaders of the saffron party arrived at the market to buy vegetables, said he has realized that common people can hardly purchase essentials in the present condition. ""After purchasing onions at Rs 80 per kilogram, potato at Rs 40, tomato at Rs 75, I feel that tea garden workers or similar wage earners can never enter this market. Why our CM does not understand this reality and do something,"" said Sonowal. He, however, stayed away from buying fruits as the price was too high.On the other hand, food and civil supplies minister Narul Islam said the price of onion will come down to Rs 50 or Rs 60 within a week. ""We are bringing onions from Nasik. It will take one week for the trucks to reach Assam. We hope the price will go down after that,"" Islam said."

390,Veggie rates double from wholesale to retail markets in Amritsar,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/Veggie-rates-double-from-wholesale-to-retail-markets-in-Amritsar/articleshow/25722466.cms,2013-11-14,The Times Of India,"AMRITSAR: Rates of many staple vegetables like onion, tomato and potato surge by two times from the wholesale market of Amritsar to the retailers of the city. The wholesale vegetable mart at Vallah is located barely 5.5 km from major retail markets of Rambagh, Lohgarh and Chhehrata, yet prices double after covering such a short distance.There is another 25% in spike in prices of these vegetables when these are bought by consumers from shops in city's posh areas.On Wednesday, TOI team visited wholesale vegetable market at Vallah to find out the rates of different commodities. Onion from Afghanistan was being sold in the range of Rs 15-20 per kg, domestic onion was priced at Rs 20-27 per kg, tomato rates were between Rs 30 and 35 per kg while potatoes were being sold at Rs 12-15 per kg.In the Rambagh and Lohgarh retail markets, domestic onions, tomatoes and potatoes were being sold at Rs 60, Rs 70 and Rs 30 per kg respectively. Being of inferior quality as compared to Indian produce, Afghan onions are being purchased by local eateries and restaurants.Retailers have to pay 9% taxes for buying vegetables from the wholesale market, which includes 5% commission, 2% rural development fund (RDF) cess and 2% market committee fee, apart from paying labour and handling charges of Rs 0.30 per kg.Even the modal rates of top grade Afghan onions, Indian onions, tomatoes and potatoes, inclusive of taxes and charges, for the retailers were Rs 22, Rs 29, Rs 38 and Rs 17 per kg respectively.Gaurav Behl, a wholesale onion and potato dealer, said that due to soaring prices of onions and tomatoes, consumption of these vegetables had come down by nearly 50%. ""Earlier, we used to sell around 10 truckloads of onion per day, but now it is less than five trucks a day,"" Behl said.Justifying the steep rise in retail prices of vegetables, a dealer Kundan said they couldn't survive if they didn't hike the rates. ""After all, we have to earn and spend on other things that have also become costlier. Moreover, such a sharp rise in vegetables rates is not a new phenomenon. It has been happening earlier also,"" he reasoned.Another retailer, Sukhi, said, ""Retail rates of vegetables have gone up since the wholesale prices too have risen. However, when the wholesale prices climb down, nobody will take note of that as everyone is bothered by stiff retail rates,"" he added.Wholesaler Gaurav expressed hope that with arrival of onions from Nasik in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, the rate of the bulbous crop would come down and even the potato prices would drop with the arrival of local crop in a week to 10 days. ""Tomato rates can still keep people see red for some days. Barring stoppage of tomato exports to Pakistan on November 14 and 15 due to Muharram, their rates will not decrease much,"" he said."
391,Future tense on vegetable front,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Future-tense-on-vegetable-front/articleshow/25781597.cms,2013-11-15,The Times Of India,"BHUBANESWAR: While West Bengal's curb created acute potato shortage and jacked up price, there would be no relief so far as other vegetables are concerned. With cyclone and floods eliminating the local production for the year, the vegetable-deficit state's problem would only worsen.According to government estimates, over 51,000 hectare of standing vegetable crop were affected in the calamities in 92 blocks. With saline ingress, most farmers are not in a position to restart rabi crop anytime soon.""Local vegetables are almost ruled out for the coming harvesting season. Prices may not come down like previous years though there is some downward revision in the cost of most vegetables this week compared to a week before,"" said general secretary of Rajdhani Haat Byabasayee Sangha Gayadhar Swain.The calamities have only added to the state's poor vegetable production. Compared to the demand, state's vegetable production is far less even during normal time.According to government figures, Odisha grows vegetables on 6.90 lakh hectare and produce around 95.15 lakh metric tonne (MT) annually. Against its annual need of over 8 lakh MT potato, Odisha produces around 2 lakh MT (14,000 hectare). Similarly, it produces 4.18 lakh MT onion (36,000 hectare), which is higher that the demand. The state mostly depends on neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal besides Maharashtra and Karnataka for other vegetables.During the 2013-14, potato has been cultivated on 15,000 hectare and government expects the production to go up to 2.5 lakh MT. Similarly, the state expects to produce 13.85 lakh MT tomato (97,000 hectare) and 4.3 lakh MT onion (36,000 hectare).""Besides small cultivation area, our productivity of around 14.17 MT per hectare (for all vegetables on an average) is far lower compared to the national average of over 22 MT. We have failed to be self-sufficient in vegetable production,"" said professor (horticulture) at Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) D K Dora.According to farmer leaders, poor state intervention in terms of marketing and storage facility is discouraging farmers from taking up the highly-perishable commodities. ""Farmers get very poor returns as they can't keep the vegetables for long. There is no storage place for them,"" said farmer leader Lingaraj.Citing the example of West Bengal (WB), which produces over 35 lakh MT of potato annually, Lingaraj said it is only because almost all districts in WB have cold storages. Government authorities said efforts are on to increase the production of various vegetables by providing more subsidies to farmers. ""The government is pursuing a farmer-friendly policy by providing suitable subsidies and building farmers' capacity. We are on the right track,"" said director (horticulture) Sanjeev Chadha.Government sources said to increase onion production in the state, the government is planning to replace traditional onion seeds with better verities to increase productivity.Of the 36,000 hectare, only 6,000 hectare at present use (desirable) multiplier onion seeds. Compared to its earlier target of providing 193 quintal onion seeds, the government has revised the target to 400 quintal for this rabi. Similarly, 250 quintal onion seeds would be given to farmers in 2014-15 kharif and 600 quintal in 2014-15 rabi.The government has approached the Sikkim state cooperative supply and marketing federation for supply of additional 10,180 quintal of potato seeds for coming rabi and has sanctioned additional Rs 2 crore subsidy to farmers to grow potato and other vegetables."

With new crop supplies from Jaipur getting delayed, there is hardly a respite for the common man till January.After Diwali, the skyrocketing veggie prices came back to normal. However, abrupt rains in some parts of Maharashtra have again thrown the prices off-balance. Tomatoes on Friday sold at Rs 40 per kg in wholesale market while potatoes were sold at whooping Rs 45 per kg. Onion after reaching up to Rs 80 per kg has now settled at Rs 60 per kg in wholesale. Prices of other seasonal vegetables, too, remained high with cabbage selling at Rs 25 per kg in wholesale.""Market has again become volatile. Unexpected showers in Maharashtra and early arrival of winter in Himachal have led to price rise. Also crop which was expected to arrive from Jaipur in October end will now be available only by December-January. After that one can expect some drop in prices,"" said Radheyshyam Phatak, president of Rajasthan Fruits and Vegetable Traders Association.The commerce and industry ministry data showed that vegetable prices shot up 78.4% year-on-year in October - onion prices rose by an annual 278.2% while tomato shot up by 122% in October last year. Policy makers assert that spike in prices was largely due to rise in food costs.""Core inflation is under limit but it is the food prices that are hurting common people most. Major reason is that supply has reduced while demand is constantly on the rise,"" said Amit Sharma, economist with a city-based financial firm.Traders claim that prices will only come down when a fresh supply from Jaipur and surrounding areas will start arriving at Mandi. ""Right now most of the vegetables are coming from outstations. They divert their produce wherever they get the maximum price. Situation will only improve when we get vegetables from city and other parts of the state,"" said Mahesh Kumar, wholesale trader at Muhana Mandi."
394,Salt rub in price-rise wounds,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131116/jsp/northeast/story_17574570.jsp,2013-11-16,Telegraph,"People jostle to buy salt at Fancy Bazar in Guwahati on Friday. Picture by UB Photos Nov. 15: Festering wounds left by skyrocketing prices of onions, potatoes and other vegetables had salt rubbed into them as rumours of short supply pushed up salt prices manifold in many places in the region. State governments across the Northeast today moved swiftly to contain panic buying of salt, sparked by rumours of scarcity because of reduced supply from outside the region. The rumours, which started last night, spread like wildfire in Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Nagaland, forcing the state administrations to hold emergency stock-taking meetings with officials and traders. It ordered a crackdown on rumour-mongers and unscrupulous traders/shopkeepers, and used public address system and the media since noon to assure the people about availability of the commodity. In most areas, panic buying pushed the price of salt from Rs 7-16 a kg to anywhere between Rs 50-300 a kg. In Meghalaya, residents woke up to a salty morning as rumours about salt shortage spread like wildfire. Panic-stricken people rushed to grocery stores, many purchasing the item. There were long queues in the market areas. One person from Upper Shillong even sent his vehicle to Iewduh (Bara Bazar) to purchase the commodity in bulk. While some shopkeepers sold the item at an inflated price, ranging between Rs 20 to Rs 300, others requested consumers not to panic as there was sufficient stock and sold it at a normal rate. Though most citizens appeared to fall prey to the rumours, some tried to bring sanity to the situation. A few even lodged complaints with police. The first to do so was a lady from Madanrting in Shillong, who filed an FIR with Laitumkhrah police against a shopkeeper who charged her Rs 20 per packet of salt when the government had fixed the rate at Rs 14 a packet. The Meghalaya government announced that there was abundant supply of the commodity and warned shopkeepers against sale of the essential item at a high price. Principal secretary, consumer affairs, P.W. Ingty said the government had taken steps to curb rumours and supply officials had conducted surprise raids. East Khasi Hills superintendent of police M. Kharkrang said no one had been arrested so far for selling salt at a higher price. East Khasi Hills deputy commissioner Sanjay Goyal said he had instructed the police to investigate the matter and find out the origin of the rumour on shortage of salt. The situation was similar in Jaitia and Garo hills. In Manipur, the situation was so alarming that minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Moirangthem Okendro Singh, convened a meeting of businessmen and officials this morning to take stock of the situation and warned retailers against hoarding and charging exorbitant prices. There were reports of long queues in front of shops and of a kilogram of salt being sold at prices ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 200. Many shopkeepers said they ran out of stock. Uploads on social network Facebook about salt scarcity in the state worsened the situation. In Tripura, salt sold at Rs 150 a kg after a local TV channel reported a major crisis in its availability. Even retailers who thronged stores and chambers of wholesalers were told that the commodity was in short supply and that they would have to purchase it at a higher price. Tripuras minister for food and civil supplies Bhanulal Saha could not be contacted but his principal private secretary S.K. Gupta said the minister had taken overall stock of salt. Poll-bound Mizoram, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will attend a poll rally tomorrow, was also hard hit by the contagious salt panic. A mad rush to buy salt started early morning with wholesalers selling hundreds of kilograms of salt to panic-stricken buyers at inflated prices. I was woken up at 7am by a friend who told me to go and buy three packets of salt for her as there was no more salt in her locality, Chanmari, said Mawii. She paid Rs 50 for a kg of salt, which usually costs Rs 16. Some people said they had paid Rs 100 a kg. Sanity prevailed after village councils and the government moved quickly to defeat rumours of nationwide salt scarcity. In Assam, chief minister Tarun Gogoi assured the people that all was well within hours of food and civil supplies minister Nazul Islam telling the media that Assam had enough stock of salt to last six months. There is no salt crisis as such in the state.

It was these traders who had given crores of rupees to the Trinamool during the panchayat elections and now they want to recover the amount, Mr. Sinha said.Coming down strongly on the State government for having no control over the current steep hike of prices of potato and some other vegetables, Mr. Sinha said it exposes the failure of the government and the bankrupt condition of the administration.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is saying a lot about taking action against corrupt potato traders  but not a single one of them has been arrested, he said.Half of the potatoes rottenHalf of the potatoes supplied by the State government [at fixed prices] are rotten and people have to throw them away. People have to pay twice the price for the staple vegetable than they have to pay in the open market, Mr. Sinha pointed out.Referring to Birbhum district president of the Trinamool Congress Anubrata Mondals threat earlier this month at Katwa in Bardhaman to cut off Congress workers wrists if found damaging posters and Ms. Banerjees cut-outs, he charged him with talking like an extremist and demanded his immediate arrest.Alleges collusion with tradersNo one has been arrested for causing shortage"

And her act of not letting trucks loaded with potatoes come to NE states through West Bengal is worst. Being the party chief, she never tried to understand the feelings of voters and party workers here. After realizing all these things, I have decided to step down from my post and from general membership,"" Purkayastha told reporters in Guwahati.Assam and other NE states faced severe price rise of potatoes and onions recently. Despite such scarcity, the West Bengal chief minister had blocked NE-bound trucks on the highway in her state. Assam CM Tarun Gogoi had to personally request Banerjee in this regard. At present, potatoes costs Rs 30 to 40 per kilogram in the state.Besides, Purkaystha lamented that party workers in Assam feel cheated by the top brass of TMC over the years as no promises have been fulfilled so far. ""When TMC was a part of the UPA government at the Centre and Mamata Banerjee was the Union railway minister, she did nothing for Assam though we expected a lot from her. No work was initiated in the Silchar-Lumding Broad gauge conversion project apart from giving a new train to be named Jajabar Express after Bhupen Hazarika,"" he added.The TMC has one MLA, Dwipen Pathak, in the assembly."

Chowdappa, principal scientist of the IIHRs Division of Plant Pathology, told The Hindu that it would have been possible to prevent the outbreak of the fungal disease as well as crop losses if the country had a good biosecurity system to screen the produces being imported for diseases.He stressed the need for setting up plant quarantine facility at all international airports in the country to prevent the entry of disease-affected plant varieties.Referring to the seriousness of this plant epidemic, he said late blight was also known as Irish potato famine fungus as it completely wiped out potato crop in Ireland in 1845. The threat intensified after a new strain of this fungus which is more harmful and resistant to several fungicides emerged in 2004 in Europe.Ever since this new strain of fungus struck Hassan in 2008, the total area under potato cultivation in this district has been reduced from 57,000 hectares to 17,000 hectares, Dr. Chowdappa said.In many StatesThe disease had spread in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, he said.He warned that wheat and forest plants could also face serious problems from fungal diseases prevalent in other countries if there was no screening of imported varieties.Costly exerciseProtecting potato and tomato crops from the fungal disease has become a costly exercise as farmers spend about Rs. 20,000 an acre on expensive fungicides, Dr. Chowdappa said.The IIHR has now come out with a package of practices for weather-linked integrated management of late blight that aims at mitigating the impact of the disease effectively and economically. Under this, Bordeaux mixture, which can be prepared by farmers by mixing copper sulphate and limestone, is being proposed for spraying on plants. According to Dr. Chowdappa, this will cost only Rs. 2,100 an acre.To create awareness among farmers on the economical methods of controlling late blight, the IIHR organised a field day on its campus earlier this week where the preparation of Bordeaux mixture and methods of spraying were demonstrated.For more details, contact Dr. Chowdappa on 9916355932.Set up plant quarantine facility at all international airportsIIHR comes out with a package of practices for weather-linked integrated management of blight"

At the Warsaw talks, the developing countries, including India, brought the devil  easing the costs of intellectual property rights (IPR) on clean technologies  back to life, by demanding that a funding mechanism be set up to buy licenses of clean-but-costly technologies.The topic of intellectual property rights has been such a hot potato for the developed countries that at the climate talks last year, developing countries had to agree to back-burner it in order to build consensus.Address IPRsBringing the topic right back to the centre-stage again at Warsaw, the Egyptian lead negotiator, speaking for the Like Minded Developing Countries, said: Like the Harry Potter series character, in Doha, IPR was the word which should not be named. But we live in the real world not in a fictional world. In this real world we live in, we need to address this issue of IPRs in a pragmatic manner, not run away from this issue.While the analogy elicited smiles and some laughter from all quarters, the real content of the proposalagain brought to the fore the deep divisions. The LMDC countries said: To begin with, we can use the financial mechanisms under the Convention to fund the IPR costs to ensure that climate-friendly technology is available to developing countries easily. A dedicated window under the Green Climate Fund for technology transfer and IPR issues should be established.Indias negotiator in the room, T.S. Tirumurti, intervened to add: The word that should not be named was one on which Parties have serious differences. There is need to be pragmatic and not run way from the issue. The delegate called for the word to be named.Egypt, speaking for the LMDC  which includes Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, China, Cuba, Dominica, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, India, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mali, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Syria and Venezuela  said the group wanted a chapter on technology development and transfer as an integral part of the 2015 outcome.The EU delegation opposed the move a day later, claiming that it saw the protection of IPRs as essential to dissemination of technologies and not as a barrier.A source in the LMDC group told The Hindu : It is important for us to keep this issue on the table. It is going to generate a lot of heat and perhaps not get as much traction but its important to not let this fall off.As the U.N. climate negotiations require consensus and not majority for decisions to be taken, the chances of a mechanism to buy out IPRs remains low and progress on the issue is bound to be hampered. But the intervention by the group, of which India and China are important members, has ensured that it will not get knocked off the decisions taken in Warsaw drawing elements for the 2015 agreement."

The state government, however, has been trying to keep prices in check by selling potato at Rs 22 per kg through Udyan Fresh outlets. Wholesale traders said that they have been selling potato between Rs 22 and Rs 24 for a kg, but the price of a kilo of tuber in retail market continues to vary from Rs 35 to Rs 40. Government officials said that the rate of potato would come down after more procurement from other states. We are getting to know that more tuber-loaded trucks are reaching here, but it has not changed the rates. We do not know when normalcy will return, said Nandini Nayak, a resident of IRC village. With the holy month of Kartik ending today, people are returning to non-vegetarian fares and this has eased the prices of other vegetables. However, the high rates of potato remain a matter of concern. The state civil supplies department has failed to take action against people pushing up the prices. We have been conducting raids on wholesale traders whenever they stockpile the stuff creating artificial shortage. But we have not got any proof regarding the inflated retail market price of the tuber. Whenever we ask retailers or wholesalers for money receipts, no one provides them. Though wholesale traders are claiming that they have been selling potato at Rs 22 and Rs 24 per kg, but retailers said that they have been getting tubers forRs 28 and Rs 30, said a civil supplies official.

While some retailers were selling potatoes at Rs 20 a kg, the customers demanded potatoes at the rate of Rs 13. But the traders refused.""Police were informed and a team from Gazole police station led by ASI Biplab Mandal reached the spot and asked the retailers to sell potatoes at state-fixed rates. But the traders refused and started assaulting the officers. They claimed that the customers had no objection till the men in uniform arrived. Outnumbered by the huge crowd, police left the spot,"" said sources.Soon this sparked panic among the people and they scampered away.Trinamool Congress held the market committee responsible for this fiasco. Local leader Rahanur Sk said, ""The market committee led the attack on police as they are hand in glove with the retailers to hike the price of potato. Locals were scared as police were assaulted in front of them. Market committee office bearers should be arrested immediately.""However, inspector in charge of Gazole police station Parimal Saha denied any such attack on police.SP Kalyan Mukherjee said, ""I've heard of an altercation of retailers with police, but haven't got the details yet.""It may be recalled that four village markets in the district were looted last week by the mob in protest against high vegetable prices.Meanwhile, acute shortage of potato in the market left Malda people reeling.

Domino's owns the largest slice of the Rs 2,300-crore organized pizza market in India with a 67% market share, as per a recent report by London-based market intelligence firm Euromonitor.And that's not even counting the umpteen street joints which serve up desi vegetarian pizzas  usually a combination of tomato, onion and capsicum topped with oodles of processed cheese. ""When it comes to junk food, there aren't many options for vegetarians . So, most of them opt for veg pizzas,"" says nutritionist and celebrity food guru Pooja Makhija. ""Even while travelling abroad, vegetarians depend on pizzas over any other food.""In India, the per capita consumption of pizzas might still be a measly four pizzas a year compared to Americans, who consume 350 slices a second , but pizzas constitute nearly half of all the fast food eaten here, according to market research firm Crisil.Sandwiches are the second choice. And despite the current economic slowdown, the domestic market for pizzas is growing at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 25%, encouraging foreign players to open more stores.The second largest pizza seller in the country, Pizza Hut, a brand of Yum! Restaurants, is also banking on its vegetarian customers. Apart from operating three vegetarian-only pizza outlets in Surat, Rajkot and Ahmedabad, its extensive menu, even in metros, is dominated by vegetarian options . ""Our non-veg offerings contribute only 30% to our pizza sales,"" says Sanjiv Razdan , brand general manager of Pizza Hut Delivery India. ""We couldn't have ignored such an important businessgenerating segment.""Pizza Hut recently ventured into Vadodara and after conducting an extensive doorto-door survey, which aimed to crack consumer tastes, came up with a pizza with potato toppings . According to Razdan, it's not just regions with vegetarian leanings like Gujarat that are driving the demand for vegetarian pizzas. ""Even states like Punjab, which one would usually associate with meat-loving people, are a huge market for our vegetarian offerings ,"" he says. ""Regular orders of non-veg pizzas on normal days are offset by large bulk orders of vegetarian food during religious occasions.""Reports by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) point out that Indians' per capita consumption of meat stands at nearly 5-5 .5kg a year. Though it is paltry compared to the Asian average of 27kg and the world average of 38kg, industry experts, such as Arvind Singhal, head of Technopak , a New Delhi-based retail consultancy, says that it is increasing year on year. ""When it comes to pizzas, you also have to take into consideration the price point,"" he says. ""Vegetarian pizzas that start from just Rs 44 are more affordable than non-veg variants. A lot of people also opt for plain margheritas without any toppings . Toppings, especially non-veg ones, cost more. And veg or not, India is still a very price sensitive market."""
405,Potato prices fall from perch,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131118/jsp/jharkhand/story_17582349.jsp,2013-11-18,Telegraph,"Welcome back, hot aloo parathas in cold mornings. Uttar Pradesh imports and local produce from Ranchis Bero block stabilised Jharkhands retail potato prices to around Rs 20-25 a kilo on Sunday, down from the astronomical Rs 35-40, but this still remains a long way off from being the poor mans food. Ever since Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee clamped supply of potatoes to neighbouring states, Jharkhand, a key buyer, had to suffer skyrocketing prices of the essential tuber. But now, though potatoes from Bengal are still missing  and sorely missed  Uttar Pradesh and early winter harvest from Bero have dragged prices down across the state. Potato per kilo retailed for Rs 20, Rs 25, Rs 25-Rs 30 and Rs 22 in Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Bokaro and Dhanbad, respectively, on Sunday. If dealers in the capital are to be believed, the price of potatoes will further come down in the next few days, making it more affordable. About 10 days ago, a 50kg potato sack in the wholesale market sold at Rs 1,100. Five days ago, it came down to Rs 900. Today, it is being sold at Rs 850. During the next 10 days, potato will flood the markets, said Md Shahjad, a wholesale dealer operating from Daily Market, Ranchi. The versatile tuber that is a staple in most Indian kitchens is also one of the main source of affordable carbohydrates for the poor. Last week, as potato prices shot through the roof, chief minister Hemant Soren wrote to his Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee asking her to resume supplies. However, Bengal consignments have still not made their appearance, at least officially. The supply of Uttar Pradesh consignments, on the other hand, is regular now. When Bengal stopped its potato supply, we started getting trucks from Uttar Pradesh. Even 10 days ago, we received some 10 trucks a day from the northern state. Now, we get 100 trucks of potato everyday from UP, said Uday Shankar Ojha, president of Jharkhand Truck Owners Association. Bero potato market, where local potato producers sell their crop, is also doing good business. We are getting some 20-25 trucks of potato from local farmers everyday. A small portion goes to states, including Bengal. But most get distributed across market hubs in Jharkhand such as Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Bokaro and Hazaribagh, said Sunder Sahu, a potato dealer at Bero wholesale market. He added that the wholesale price of potato in Bero, which around 10 days ago was Rs 18-Rs 20 per kg, was Rs 14-15 per kg now. Prices will fall further as large tracts of land are ready with the new crop of potatoes. Even if Bengals potato does not come soon, people can look forward to buy the tuber at Rs 15-16 per kg in the next 10 days or so, Sahu said.

He works for the Copenhagen Studies of Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC), the Danish Pediatric Asthma Center, Copenhagen University Hospital, said that their results show that asthma attacks requiring young children to be hospitalised are usually genetically related.He said that genes play a far greater role in children with asthma than in adults. By screening childrens DNA theyve discovered that a gene called CDHR3, which was previously unassociated with the disease, plays a key role for the development of asthma, particularly in the very early years of life. The researchers have studied the genes of 1,200 young children aged between two and six who had been hospitalised several times because of severe asthma attacks, and compared them with 2,500 healthy people.The study was based on examinations of 1,200 Danish children hospitalised for asthma and 2,500 healthy individuals.

A pilot study conducted by Fronterra North America found that females who supplemented their regular diet with an additional 20 grams of protein at both breakfast and lunch over a three-week period lost two inches from their waist.Meanwhile, a recent study indicated that rice protein helped recovery time after exercise and improved body composition and exercise performance.Using a double-blind, randomized cross-over design, researchers from Iowa State University found that an emerging fiber, soluble fiber dextrin, may help promote satiety from three to eight and a half hours after consumption.A recent study showed that consuming raisins as an after school snack compared to potato chips or cookies in children 8-11 years-old led to a lower cumulative food intake."

411,Party banks on Modi for capital challenge...,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131119/jsp/nation/story_17586968.jsp,2013-11-19,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Nov. 18: The BJPs campaign in Delhi has gained no traction with a little over two weeks before the capital polls. Rebellion outbursts, alleged excessive interference by some top central leaders over ticket distribution, perplexity over the role of the Aam Aadmi Party and its potential to commit damage and chief ministerial candidate Harshvardhans less-than-inspiring image have torpedoed the BJPs intent to emerge as the Congresss prime challenger. The upshot of the tardy take-off is that the BJP has registered its presence on voters through a 3-D motorised rath (chariot) that bears a huge picture of Narendra Modi and a smaller one of Harshvardhan. The rath perambulating across Delhis highways plays a Modi speech  in the form of a 3-D video  that he delivered at a Delhi rally in September and nothing else. Lets admit. Madhya Pradesh has Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Chhattisgarh has Raman Singh and Rajasthan, Vasundhara Scindia. We have only Modi to draw the public, said a local leader. The BJPs endeavour to hit the Congress on inflation and rising vegetable prices  depicted in its posters showing onions, potatoes and tomatoes and their prices per kilo  has not elicited the expected response, said sources. Unfortunately in the slums and resettlement colonies, we are labelled a bania (traders) party. So our campaign carries little credibility, a source confessed. Sources alleged that a few central bosses, who took no interest in the affairs of the Delhi BJP before the elections, had their way when tickets were given. In one suburban constituency, where the partys internal surveys reportedly placed a young leader ahead of the pack of contenders, a much older candidate, who came third in the 2008 polls, was selected because of his alleged proximity to one leader. In a north-western constituency, another leader pitched for Pravesh Verma, the scion of a former Delhi chief minister, the late Sahib Singh Verma, overlooking the claims of an incumbent councillor who sources said had been earlier promised a ticket. The rejected contender confronted the leader and asked for an explanation. He was told not to protest over it much and was assured that he would be given a Lok Sabha ticket. Peeved at the response, the councillor, who is supposedly well-networked in his area, is now indifferent to electioneering. The BJPs biggest concern is that its middle and upper class voters, barring the committed ones from the RSS stream, might plump for Arvind Kejriwals AAP if they were determined to vote out the Congress. The AAP looks like it is about to damage us more. Our feedback is that the Congresss support in the slums remains largely undented, a source said. To compound the BJPs woes, its Delhi veterans like V.K. Malhotra, Vijay Goel and Vijendra Gupta are either grounded in the constituencies of their nominees or in their own. Gupta is fighting chief minister Sheila Dikshit and Kejriwal. Malhotra, who is L.K. Advanis peer and was projected as the chief minister candidate the last time, is focused on his son Ajays win while Goel reportedly turned cold once Harshvardhan was chosen as the chief ministerial face. Modi apart, the BJP has pinned its hopes for a respectable showing on its propaganda messages. One was that a vote for the AAP meant a vote for the Congress because the BJP claimed Kejriwal was a Congress proxy. The other was a prestigious place like Delhi could not afford to go into the hands of rookies and anarchists from the AAP."

On Monday, the government had instructed potato retailers not to breach the Rs 20-a-kilo ceiling. But consumers today alleged that they were forced to buy the vegetable for Rs 30 a kg. At many places, consumers had heated exchange with the traders when they refused to pay more than the government stipulated price for a kilo of potato. Consumers also complained that the government partnered Udyan Fresh shops in the city were selling potato at Rs 25 a kg. Officials of civil supplies department, however, claimed that while carrying out checks during the day they found that potato price stood at Rs 20. Secretary, food supplies and consumer welfare department, M.S. Padhi said that retailers were bound to sell potato at Rs 20 a kg because the wholesale price had dropped to Rs 16. Despite increased supply and decrease in wholesale prices, the retail rate of was not coming down. After the government order, many shopkeepers sold potato at Rs 20 a kg last evening. But this morning when I went to Unit-IV, the shopkeeper demanded Rs 30 for a kilo (of potato). When I told him about the government rate, he asked me either to buy from him or get lost, said Gagan Mishra, a resident of Unit-II. People alleged that the shopkeepers not only violated the government diktat, but were also misbehaving with the consumers. I bought potato for Rs 30 a kg from the market near my house today. When I told the shopkeeper about the government decision, he did not pay any heed to it. This led to an altercation with him, said Abinash Pati, a retired schoolteacher. An official of the civil supplies department said that 10 city markets were inspected today. We have asked the shopkeepers to display the rate chart in their shops, he said. At Udyan Fresh shops, there were allegations of the tuber being sold at Rs 25. As the price in the market is higher, I went to the nearby Udyan Fresh and they demanded Rs 27 a kg. When I asked an employee they said that they had no instruction from their higher ups, said Adikant Palei, a resident of Chandrasekharpur. However, operations head of Udyan Fresh Bijay Kumar Mahapatra said they had been sticking to the governments orders. An official of the civil supplies department said the city had enough stock of potatoes to bring the prices down to Rs 20 a kilo and less."

Potatoes are selling at the vegetable market at this current price because the city now has adequate amount of the vegetable to fulfill requirements of the people. Arrival of local potatoes at market has also helped in bringing down the price.Local trader Faisal from Daily Market said on Tuesday, ""The price of potatoes has come down as there is good supply at the markets. Also, we are getting local potatoes which have helped.""Though vegetables grown in winter have now flooded the markets, prices continue to be sky high. Most vegetables including cauliflower, brinjal, ladies finger, capsicum etc are being sold at an average rate of Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg.Even radish is being sold at Rs 30 per kg. Onions are being sold at Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg at the market which has also come down from Rs 60-70 per kg.Relieved at the slashed prices, Savitri Devi from Hindpidi, said, ""Now at least I can include potatoes in my daily menu.

416,Left despondent before civic polls,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131121/jsp/bengal/story_17595098.jsp,2013-11-21,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Nov. 19: A turn-around seems distant for the Left Front as it gasps for breath in Howrah, Jhargram, Midnapore, Krishnagar and Behrampore, where civic polls will be held on Friday. CPM leaders in Calcutta admitted that they had hardly anything to lose in the battle for the five civic bodies as the organisation was in disarray. So bleak is the scenario that no top leader from Alimuddin Street visited the poll-bound areas to address rallies. While the CPM controls the Jhargram municipality and the Howrah Municipal Corporation, Trinamul runs the Midnapore and Krishnagar civic bodies. The Congress is at the helm of the Behrampore municipality. Truly speaking, our party no longer has organisational strength in any of these areas, except Howrah to a certain extent. So we are not attaching much importance to the results, CPM state secretariat member Gautam Deb said. Debs admission is significant as the Jhargram municipality and the Howrah Municipal Corporation have been controlled by the Left for nearly three decades. CPM sources said the local cadres had virtually given up and the top leadership seemed resigned to the inevitability of a whitewash. Trinamul hoodlums are creating terror all over the state. The civic polls will be rigged, just like the other elections in the past two-and-a-half years, Deb said, trying to explain the reason behind the despondency. Although leaders like Deb have been citing terror tactics of Trinamul and the depletion of organisational strength of the CPM for the Lefts poor performances in successive elections, a section in the CPM pointed fingers at lack of direction from the leadership. A disgruntled CPM leader gave the example of Midnapore to explain what he perceived as lack of leadership from Alimuddin. He said the CPM had done little to tap anti-incumbency in Midnapore. Trinamul has been at the helm of the municipality for three terms. So anti-incumbency is bound to set in. Besides, 10 dissident Trinamul candidates are contesting against party nominees. But our party has done little to cash in on these factors, the leader said. If we could have managed to defeat Trinamul in Midnapore, it would have been a big boost to the partys morale But there was no effort on the part of our leadership, he added. The scene is similar in Jhargram, where the CPM was routed in the July panchayat polls. The party won only two of the 67 zilla parishad seats. The CPMs poor show in West Midnapore, which used to be a party bastion till a couple of years ago, was discussed in recent state committee meetings, where there were calls for a change in the district leadership. But a leader said today that the CPM would not be able to achieve much by changing the district leadership. There is no direction. We have failed to organise any movement despite several opportunities, he said. Be it the recent rise in prices of vegetables, including potatoes and onions, or the Saradha default, the CPM has failed to organise any movement. Although some local-level leaders are trying to highlight these issues in the run-up to the Howrah Municipal Corporation polls, the overall campaign has been lack-lustre, a CPM leader admitted. We do not stand a chance in the other two municipalities  Krishnagar and Behrampore, he added. Even though Trinamul and the Congress are not fighting the polls in an alliance, the Left Front has failed to derive any advantage from that."
417,Something is cooking in city of Nabanna,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131121/jsp/bengal/story_17595106.jsp,2013-11-21,Telegraph,"Jagan and Mamata at the news conference at Nabanna on Wednesday. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha Calcutta, Nov. 20: Fish fry for Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy. Potatoes for Naveen Patnaik. Some political noses are catching a federal aroma in the simmering pot of Nabanna. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee today played gracious host to YSR Congress chief Jagan, who came to the Bengal secretariat to seek her support in his campaign against the Centres decision to create Telangana. Hours before reassuring Jagan, Mamata slipped into the role of a kind neighbour by announcing that one lakh tonnes of potatoes would be sent to Odisha, which is reeling from a severe shortage of the tuber. Although Mamata did not elaborate on the chances of participating in a federal front  she stuck to a United India Front  it was evident that the chief minister was happy with Kadapa MP Jagan coming to meet her. With Jagan by her side, Mamata launched a virulent attack on the Centre at a news conference, holding Delhi responsible for all ills plaguing the country  from price rise to the states share of central taxes and the refusal to give a moratorium on the debt incurred by the Left Front government. She held the hands of the YSR Congresss Jagan and the BJDs Naveen Patnaik before attacking the Centre. These are signs of her attempts to forge an alliance with like-minded parties, a Trinamul source said. Mamata has been championing the cause of federalism for some time by trying to get the Centre to give more power to states and bring other chief ministers on the same platform. The support offered by Patnaik and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar to Mamatas federal plank has sparked speculation that the Bengal chief minister is trying to stitch together a federal front to take on the Congress and the BJP. Mamata today dodged questions on the possibility of a federal front. The federal front is always there. From the day Jagans party was formed, it has been with us. We share a good relationship and understanding. The federal front will come later. Abhi United India Front hai (Now is the time for the United India Front), she said after the 70-minute meeting at Nabanna, which means rice just after harvest. Mamatas comments made it clear she had not ruled out the possibility of a federal front. Trinamul sources said that by stepping up her criticism of the Centre, Mamata had indicated that she was aiming to align herself with anti-Congress forces. Given her dependence on minority votes, it is assumed that she wont go with the BJP, which is projecting Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial candidate. The Congress had promised Telangana five years ago. Why didnt they do anything till now? Creating a state with a political motive is not correct. You cannot bulldoze before elections. Divide and rule does not help, Mamata said. The reason for rallying behind Jagan, who is opposed to Telangana, is easy to understand as Mamata had faced similar problems in the Darjeeling hills, where the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha is demanding statehood. Although the government has countered the hill crisis with strong administrative measures, the chief minister is aware that the creation of Telangana could create fresh trouble. Mamata is keen on having Odisha chief minister Patnaik on board as his clean image and anti-NDA stance would help her reinforce her secular credentials. Patnaik is a rare regional party leader to have broken off from either the BJP or the Congress and still won a state election. Sources said Mamata, whose government has banned export of potatoes, agreed to Patnaiks request for the tuber as the two leaders had spoken a few days ago. We must look after our neighbours to the best of our ability after taking care of our own needs, Mamata said in the Assembly today. Jagan, who addressed Mamata as Didi, welcomed the Trinamul chiefs support for him. The Centre can divide any state, acting on its whims and fancies, unless Article 3 of the Constitution is amended. My personal relationship with Didi is very good. I am happy that she is supporting us, he said. Article 3 deals with the formation of new states and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing states Jagan said a new state should be cleared by two-thirds majority in Parliament besides the Assemblys consent. Mamata supported Jagans stand, saying Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh were created on the basis of a consensus in Parliament. She added that the decision to create Telangana was taken even though there was no such consensus. Sources said Mamata gifted a showpiece to Jagan and sent a sari for his mother Vijayamma."
418,Traders seek fair potato rate,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131121/jsp/siliguri/story_17594119.jsp,2013-11-21,Telegraph,"Malda, Nov. 20: Traders in Malda district today made it clear to the administration that it was impossible to sell potatoes at Rs 13 a kg fixed by the government and they wanted to sell the spuds at a reasonable price. The Malda Merchants Chamber of Commerce made the comment at a meeting between its representatives and the district task force on food prices in the district magistrates office. Malda is not a potato growing district and our traders have to buy the stock from districts such as Burdwan and Hooghly and bring it here. We can buy the potato but the administration should ensure that we are allowed to sell them at a reasonable rate so that our livelihood does not suffer, said Ujjwal Saha, the secretary of the traders body. He said the administration had been told at the meeting of the task force that the potatoes couldnt be sold at Rs 13 a kilo. Saha said there was a demand of 150 tonnes of potato daily throughout the district. Our wholesalers have stopped buying potatoes as they are not able to sell at Rs 13. At present, potatoes brought from cold storages are selling at Rs 22 to Rs 25 a kilo. The freshly grown varieties are selling for Rs 35 a kilo. There are only three government outlets in the district  in Englisbazar, Gajole and Chanchal  where the spuds are available at Rs 13. The district magistrate, G. Kiran Kumar, said the merchants had been requested to buy potato from outside, but also ensure that consumers were not harassed. He said a constant vigil was being kept on the markets. Potatoes are being sold at Rs 13 a kilo. Our task force members are regularly visiting the markets. We have approached the Malda Merchants Chamber of Commerce which said the supply of potatoes needed to be increased and we are working to make that happen, said Kiran Kumar. The meeting had been preceded by a two-hour demonstration by the Congress in front of the district magistrates office to protest against vegetable price rise. The agitation was led by North Malda MP Mausam Noor. The administration has failed to control the prices of items like potatoes despite repeated assurances. We will launch a widespread movement if the prices are not brought down, said Mausam. The MP alleged that the Mamata Banerjee government was to blame for the price rise. Ever since the Trinamul Congress came to power in Bengal, prices of all items have gone up. Although the government has fixed the price of potato at Rs 13 a kilo, the vegetable has vanished from the market and whatever is available is being sold at up to Rs 25 a kilo. The ruling party will have to be answerable to the people, said Mausam. Tourism minister and Englishbazar MLA Krishnendu Chowdhury termed Mausams agitation as a gimmick. What has she done as an MP in the past four years? She and her party have nothing to show in terms of development of the district. What she did today was just a photo-session. The administration is doing best to keep prices under control."
419,Potato subsidy comes with seeds of doubt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131121/jsp/bengal/story_17595105.jsp,2013-11-21,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Nov. 20: Mamata Banerjee today promised to give subsidised potato seeds to 30,000 farmers to ensure smooth supply of the tuber next year but questions were raised on whether distribution among a select group was enough to tackle a structural problem. The chief minister made the announcement through a written statement in the Assembly this morning. Thirty-thousand farmers will be given 100 kilo of certified seeds at Rs 18 a kilo, compared to the uncertified, poor quality seeds the farmers have to buy from states like Punjab at Rs 60 per kilo, the statement says. This is the second time this year that the government is making an intervention in the potato market. Earlier, the government had pegged the price of potato at Rs 13 a kg. The ceiling could not be imposed in all markets and potatoes continued to be sold at Rs 25 to Rs 30 a kg. The government can always intervene in the market. But the question is whether such interventions will yield results, a potato trader said. He said though the reason behind the distribution of subsidised seeds was to soften potato prices the next season, meeting the objective would be easier said than done. Sources in the agriculture department said the states annual potato seed requirement was around 7 lakh tonnes, but the government would distribute only 3,000 tonnes at the subsidised rate. Some farmers are buying high-priced seeds from the market. This will push up their cost of production and consequently, the price of potatoes, an agriculture department official said. A section of farmers is using their potato stock  old potatoes can be used as seeds  this sowing season, but that affects productivity and quality. If the trend this sowing season, which began in November, is any indication, the production next year is bound to suffer, an official said. This will push up prices even if the government imposes a ceiling, he added. Some experts said the state government had tried to solve the potato crisis through knee-jerk reactions instead of proper planning. The most important thing is we need home-grown seeds, which will significantly reduce the cost of cultivation, a senior agriculture department official said. The quality of the seeds the government will supply to the farmers has also been questioned. The seeds have been grown in Burdwan and West Midnapore, where the agriculture department had supplied the mother seeds to farmers and bought the produce from them. In such a system, the quality is often compromised as it is tough for the department to monitor whether the farmers are following the required practice while growing the seeds, an official said. Officials said the department could have taken the initiative of growing seeds in its own farms. Conspiracy theory Mamata today told the members of the task force formed to monitor prices of essential commodities that she feared the agriculture commodities market was being manipulated as she was opposed to FDI in retail. She told the task force members at Nabanna that even though the state had enough stock of potatoes in cold storages, the price of the tuber had gone up. She told traders who attended the meeting she was sure that the onion price rise was a well-designed plan. She expressed her surprise at depleting onion stock. Where did the stock go? Production of onion was not hit by any natural disaster. I believe the onion stock was exported silently, Mamata was quoted as saying."

It was due to this that the prices were ruling higher in the State than in many others.Citing the recent rise in price of potato they slammed Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for not giving any thought to the alarming situation that has arisen from the steep price rise of essential food items as well as the artificial scarcity in various markets.Accusing her of trying to mislead the people by entering the markets time and again and admonishing traders, the employees organisations said, the task force set up by the State government to curb price rise is actually working to safeguard the interests of hoarders.The trade unions claimed that whereas in other countries the rate of price rise is from one to three percent, in India it is close to 10 percent, because the ruling party supports the neo-liberal economic policy of the Centre.They claimed that the recent price rise of salt in the State has taken place due to black-marketing.Despite the steep hike in prices of agricultural commodities the farmers are not getting appropriate prices for their crop and the middlemen are making profit.They also slammed the State government for doing little to reduce the prices of petrol and diesel."

Due to rising demand and shrinking supply, the potato prices were up recently, he added.The demand for potato increased due to its substitution for other costly vegetables, he said, while pointing out disruption in the supply of vegetables because of delayed summer and late rainfall during September-October 2013. At the same time, the high temperature during these months adversely affected the yield of new pre-mature harvested potato crop, he observed.""High potato prices during November have prompted the farmers to harvest pre-mature potato from larger area. Therefore, the supply of main crop during February 2014 onwards may be tightened, which will put upward pressure on potato prices during 2013-14,"" Sidhu said.Moreover, the potato production was also likely to decline marginally as the untimely rainfall during its harvesting time in February 2013 had adversely affected the quality of potato seed in most parts of the state, he added.Highlighting that potato was the most important vegetable in India, Sidhu said India was the second largest producer of this crop with more than 10% share in world potato production after China, with a share of 22%.""In India, about 85% potato is grown in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand and Punjab,"" he said.Most of the potato produced in the country is consumed within the country with very little export mainly to neighbouring countries such as Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.Punjab state accounts for about 5% of the total potato production in the country, he said.The area and production of potato in the country remained almost same during 2012-13 as that of last year around 19 lakh hectares and 450 lakh tonnes, respectively.Similarly in Punjab, the area and production of potato remained around 85,000 hectares and 21 lakh tonnes, respectively, during the same period, he said.Sidhu advised farmers to keep in mind the above information while taking their potato harvesting, selling and storage decisions."

However, traders in Assam have to pay Rs 600 and Rs 280 per quintal as road and rail transportation charges, respectively.Recently, the Kamrup (Metro) administration has issued a toll free number where consumers can lodge complaints if vendors are selling products at a price higher than the price set by the administration.Officials at the deputy commissioner's office said that so far they have not received any official complaint but only general complaints. ""The response has been good. If we get any concrete complaint, our team will visit the place and do the needful,"" said an official."

The traders had said the ban violated Article 301 of the Constitution, which provides for freedom of trade through the territory of India.Around 3 lakh tonnes of potatoes will be exported in the next few weeks. Most of the consignments will go to Odisha and Assam, where there is an acute shortage of potatoes, an official said.He said the situation in the states markets had been showing signs of improvement and added: Besides, the need to release stocks ahead of the new crop cannot be overlooked.The states cold storages have eight lakh tonnes of potatoes. As the intra-state consumption till the arrival of the new crop wont cross five lakh tonnes, sources said the government had decided to release some of the stocks.On Wednesday, Mamata Banerjee had said the government would send one lakh tonnes of potatoes to Odisha."
424,Roadmap little help for farmers hit by calamity,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131124/jsp/bihar/story_17606258.jsp,2013-11-24,Telegraph,"The absence of sufficient cold storage in north Bihar districts has hit hundreds of farmers hard even as they fought the disasters of drought and cyclone in the past few months. Ranbir Singh of Dhanusi village on the Muzaffarpur-Vaishali-Hajipur road had 70 per cent of his standing paddy crops over four acres of land destroyed by cyclone Phailin in October and he could not implant seedling on the rest of his three acres because of severe drought that preceded the storm. I have so far got only the first lot of subsidy on irrigation against the governments claim that it has paid the same for four lots, Ranbir said, adding: We are running from the pillar to post to get the rest three lots of subsidy but to no avail. Be it Ranbir of Dhanusi, Dilip Singh of Namadih or Jaiprakash Sahu of Ghotaro on the fertile stretch capped with green litchi, banana and mango trees from Muzaffarpur to Vaishali - the farmers are grappling with the damage caused by the long spell of drought during July and August followed by Phailin in October. Known for the fabulous production of litchi, banana, mangoes, paddy, potato, wheat and maize the north Bihars region today has farmers battling with destruction caused by two spells of natural calamities - drought and cyclone. We are still dependent on nature to rescue or destroy us. The government has seldom stepped in to help us either with finance or with tools, storage facilities, seeds and fertilisers, said Satyendra Singh of Namadih. A few farmers in the agriculture-rich ubiquitous villages on the Muzaffarpur-Vaishali-Hajipur highway were even remotely aware of the ambitious agriculture roadmap (2012-15) that chief minister Nitish Kumar got President Pranab Mukherjee to inaugurate with much fanfare here on October 3, 2012. The cardinal features of the roadmap involving 18 government departments included the building of Rs 1,799.50-crore Gandak canal project phase II that will irrigate vast tracts of farmlands in Samastipur, Muzaffarpur, Vaihali, Sitamarhi, East Champaran and West Champaran districts, setting up of agriculture cooperatives, opening chains of cold storages and warehouses to ensure long retention of the produce, survey and consolidation of the lands besides providing market access and credit to the farmers. The work on the mega Gandak canal project phase II, which the first President Rajendra Prasad had envisioned and which Nitish thought of building, is yet to begin. Anger writ large, the farmers ubbish the promises made in the roadmap. We were forced to sell our potato at the rate of Rs 300 per quintal last year for we had no storage facility nearby. Now we are buying potato to eat at the rate of Rs 30 per kg, said Dilip of Namadih."
425,Scion’s Nobel poll promise,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131125/jsp/nation/story_17609275.jsp,2013-11-25,Telegraph,"Raghaogarh (Madhya Pradesh), Nov. 24: Joseph Eugene Stiglitz is not a name that would roll easily off an Indian farmers tongue. But if some people in backward Raghaogarh seem suddenly aware of the American economist and Nobel laureate, thank the new princely entrant into Madhya Pradeshs electoral scene. Jaivardhan Singh or JV, the 27-year-old son of Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh, has promised voters he would bring Stiglitz to Raghaogarh, a small principality in Guna district his family once ruled. The idea is to receive expert advice on how to improve rural folks lives here, and stands in intriguing contrast to the usual poll promises about free cereals or colour TVs. I shall bring professionals from the United Nations, World Bank and other reputable forums. I have already invited my professor from Columbia University (Stiglitz) to come and suggest micro-level projects at the village level, Jaivardhan told a news channel in between addressing meetings in Raghaogarh town. Jaivardhan, an MBA in rural development from Columbia University, said the visit was likely to happen next January. Few in Raghaogarh would have till now heard of the economist, known for his critical views on the IMF, World Bank, globalisation and the way free markets are managed. But Jaivardhans promise has had quite a few of them excited. I had not heard of the American economist before but Im sure that Jaivardhans plans would transform the constituency. Like his father, he is a visionary, said P.D. Sharma, a landowner and educated farmer. In his book The Price of Inequality, Stiglitz has argued that widely unequal societies dont function effectively or have stable economies, and that even the rich must pay a steep price if economic inequalities continue to worsen. In a recent blog, Stiglitz wrote that US food policy lacked logic as it was based on spending billions on farm subsidies and planting more crops than required. As a result, a glut depresses world crop prices and harms farmers in developing countries. Stiglitz quoted economist Amartya Sen to argue that even famines are caused not necessarily by a lack of supply but by a failure to reach food to people. This was true of the 1943 Bengal famine and of the Irish potato famine a century earlier, he wrote. Before joining the electoral fray, Jaivardhan worked as a research fellow in the Planning Commission under its deputy chairman, Montek Singh Ahluwalia. In August 2010, he came to Raghaogarh with Digvijaya to enrol in the Indian Youth Congress. Raghaogarh has been plastered with posters and banners carrying Jaivardhans photographs. Most refer to him as Baba, Kunwar Sahib or Yuva Hriday Samrat. Jaivardhan blushed when some youngsters described him as the younger face of actor Arjun Rampal."

Like NCP, JD (U) too was fighting against the communal forces, he added. Tariq also predicted a record food production in the country in 2013-14 and hoped the prices would come down soon with the arrival of fresh crops in the market.NCP president and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar will share platform with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar here on December 7, Tariq said. The Union agriculture ministry has organized a national seminar on promotion of food processing industries in Bihar, which will be attended by both Pawar and Nitish.Tariq said the 14-party forum against communalism has both NCP and JD (U) as its members and they have made a common cause against communal forces. ""Whosoever fights against communal forces would be welcomed by the NCP,"" he said. The party will decide its political strategy on December 7 at Miller School grounds, where workers' conference would be held. It will be inaugurated by Pawar.He claimed there was no shortage of onion or potato in the country and it was an artificial crisis created by the hoarders. The state governments should take action against the middlemen and hoarders, like the West Bengal government has done, he suggested. He claimed the country exported food items worth Rs 2.37 lakh crore last year. These included rice, wheat, fruits, vegetables, mutton and fish."

""The tomato crop that normally arrives from Gujarat at this time of the year has been delayed. Once supplies resume, prices will fall,"" said APMC director Shankar Pingle, adding that the situation will ease after the predictable 15 days.The wholesale rate in APMC Vashi on Monday was Rs 30-50. But at Mt Mary in Bandra, vendor Pappu Jaiswal said, ""I am selling tomato for Rs 80 because the wholesale rate is Rs 60 and I incur costs on transportation as well. The truth is we only hear of short arrivals-the Vashi market is filled with produce. It is strange how the cost of basic items like salt, onion and tomato has risen so high ahead of the elections.""One of the largest wholesalers, Javed Haroon Memon, said, ""First there was Phailin in Odisha and now Helen in Andhra Pradesh. Both have caused extensive crop damage.""Tomato prices, though, had risen well before Helen made landfall last Friday. Also, it is not clear how any cyclonic impact in Andhra Pradesh should reflect on markets in faraway Mumbai within two days of a storm. Importantly, the paddy zone has been affected but no damage is reported to tomato.Considering that low stock is not an issue in Vashi, consumers wonder how such a common food item became so costly. ""We expect onion, potato and tomato to be affordable. Now tomatoes are as exorbitant as onions,"" said Smita Khandelwal, a Sanpada housewife."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Nov. 26: The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) today submitted an action plan to Assam government, aimed at monitoring supply and prices of vegetables. A team of the farmers organisation today met state agriculture minister Nilamoni Sen Deka and submitted an 11-point charter seeking land for opening at least 20 shops in Guwahati and at least five in each of the 27 district headquarters for starting fair price farmers markets. The KMSS team, led by its president Akhil Gogoi, told the minister that they were willing to start fair price markets, which would control 25 per cent of supplies and sell food items at less than the market prices. The team also sought a Rs 1 crore interest-free loan and vehicles at 50 per cent subsidy for transportation of goods from farms to markets. Reducing the role of unholy middlemen is the only way to control food prices. There should be a mandi for open auction of vegetables. If the government supports us, we will start the fare price markets, the KMSS said. The KMSS had recently put up stalls in Guwahati and had sold onions, potatoes and other vegetables at lesser prices. They sold onion at Rs 55 per kg when the market price was Rs 70 per kg. Retail prices of potatoes and onions had touched Rs 40 and Rs 90 respectively in Guwahati in the first week of this month. At present, potatoes are being sold at Rs 24 per kg and onions at Rs 40 per kg. The KMSS also demanded that special vendor trains be run between Guwahati and the district headquarters to help farmers sell their produce directly in the markets here. It sought steps to remove syndicates, money collection by police and the agricultural department. There should be 50 per cent subsidy on transport of agriculture produce. The government should also fix a minimum support price for agriculture produce. The department should constantly monitor prices and fix maximum retails prices of food items accordingly, Akhil said."

Districts like Chatra, Hazaribag and Balumath region of Latehar, along with villages close to Ranchi adjacent to NH-33, usually produce tomatoes in large quantities. Even after exporting to other states, farmers would suffer losses as tomatoes were sold at throwaway prices.But this year the situation seemed to be different. Agriculture experts blame it on Cyclone Phailin.The cyclonic circulation hit the state in the second week of October and damaged seedlings of crops almost all over the state.""Since one lot of seedling was wasted in the three-day incessant rain causing water logging in the fields farmers had to go for second round of sowing which is yet to mature to bear fruits,"" said Jata Shankar Choudhary, director state agriculture management and extension training institute (Sameti).He said prices would come down by first week of December when rabi production comes to market.Farmers had almost similar experience last year. It was in the first week of December 2012 that vegetable prices crashed suddenly because of heavy supply.The situation had proved detrimental for farmers as they could not even realize their input cost and had to sell away cauliflowers, French beans and tomatoes at one-fifth of the prices in the previous month.Choudhary said in absence of proper marketing infrastructure, similar situation could not be ruled out this year.Farmers blame it on traders as well. While tomato is still being sold at Rs 20-30 in village markets, it becomes dearer by Rs 10 a kg after reaching the urban market.""We were the real sufferers because the first round of sowing got wasted and our input cost was almost doubled but since there is no provision to stock farm produce we have to sell to the traders at whatever rate is being offered,"" said Jayendra Mahato of Makhmandro village.Makhmandro's weekly wholesale haat is the central point for farmers around Ratu region to sell their produce.Prior to 2005-06, Ranchi has experienced tomato prices coming as low as Rs 2 per kg due to bumper production.Farmers say in absence of marketing chain even bumper production is a reason for their loss. ""We cannot stock our produce and have to go by the diktat of market in general and traders in particular,"" Sukhdeo Mahato said who is considered a progressive farmer for using modern methods of farming."

Narasimha Raos record in managing the economy and urged the Congress to take lessons from its former Prime Minister. They (Congress leaders) say they do not want lessons in economics from Modi. Fine. Then please learn from P.V. Narasimha Rao how to run the country. Learn from Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Rao and Vajpayee were not regarded as economists but they had robust common sense, the BJP leader told a public meeting in Shahadra, east Delhi, at the start of a two-day election campaign. The Congress has all but obliterated Rao from its collective memory. His birth anniversary, celebrated every year in the national capital by some people from Andhra Pradesh from where the late leader came from, is attended fleetingly by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who was cherry-picked by Rao in 1991 to execute his agenda of economic liberalisation that lifted India from the morass it had sunk into during the tenures of V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar. The BJP, too, had never been kind to Rao. Initially, when Rao was bringing the economy back on the rails, Vajpayee and L.K. Advani occasionally praised him, although the RSS and its progeny, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, were critical of the reforms programme. Their stand was encapsulated in the slogan Yes to computer chips, no to potato chips, which was their way of saying that foreign direct investments were okay in high technology but not in processed food. Closer to the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, the BJPs infrequent approbations vanished amid a campaign on the string of scams that marked Raos regime: from Harshad Mehtas alleged manipulation of the stock market to urea import and the bribes paid to JMM MPs to save the minority Congress government. BJP sources said Modi wanted to reinforce his point that the Gandhis treated the Congress as their exclusive fief and ignored the contributions made by the partys other luminaries. In the past, he stressed how the dynasty had relegated the role of Sardar Patel and Lal Bahadur Shastri to virtual oblivion. Alluding to Union minister Kapil Sibal, Modi said: There is a top Congress leader who thinks of himself as an intellectual. Its almost as though when god was distributing parcels of intellect, he gifted this man the most and left the rest of us empty-headed. This man, who is a cabinet minister, said prices have gone up because earlier the poor used to eat only two rotis. Now they have two vegetables too. Has the Congress ruled that the poor cant eat vegetables? What kind of language is this? Sibals comment was made in response to a question. Then Modi attacked the Prime Minister and finance minister P. Chidambaram. The PM is an eminent economist and we have never questioned or criticised his knowledge and understanding. The finance minister is well educated and I dont contest the degrees he holds. But this cabal of intellectuals has sent the country down the drainpipe. They are afraid of facing Delhis voters because they know inflation is the biggest issue in the elections. What is their answer? Level filthy charges against Modi and his government on Facebook, Twitter, Modi said. He claimed the price index stayed low whenever a non-Congress formation ruled at the Centre. Modi must have forgotten that the BJP was wiped out in Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in 1998 because the NDA government did nothing to check the price of onions that shot up to Rs 100 a kilo."

Prices have shot up because supplies have slowed down due to unseasonal rains at the time of harvesting in key growing states.The costlier vegetables such as onions had drove retail inflation to 10.09 per cent in October, entering double digits after seven months.The survey said food price spiral has pinched all the lower and middle-class families across the board.""More than 62 per cent of salaried families said that they shell out between Rs 4,000 to 6,000 on vegetables and fruits now, while this expenditure was one-fourth of it about three years ago. So, they are now forced to rethink their daily menus,"" it said.The chamber asked the government to take immediate steps to control the situation."
437,Space science is value for money,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131202/jsp/nation/story_17634063.jsp,2013-12-02,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Dec. 1: Fisherman Nubin Roy felt a surge of pride when he heard about Indias Mars mission that some activists have criticised as a project that prioritises esoteric science over basic needs in an unequal society. But blind nationalism wasnt driving his pride. Twice a week, Roy sails into the North Andaman Sea on his 12-metre-long motorised boat to haul in groupers, mackerel, red and white snappers, and tuna for dinner tables on the islands, elsewhere in India or in foreign lands. Roy knows exactly where to anchor, guided by a strip of paper with latitude and longitude readings generated by scientists in Hyderabad who use Indias Oceansat-2 satellite to pinpoint marine zones abundant in fish. Since Roy began to rely on satellite-based potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories three years ago, his boat has been returning with 400kg to 500kg fish from each trip, against the typical 200kg catch earlier. Hes bought a refrigerator, a TV and a cellphone. I dont waste fuel, I sell more fish, and life is better, said Roy, 29, who grew up in Port Blair but has spent the past 10 years as a fisherman-sailor in Shibpur, a village on the east coast of the island of North Andaman. The Indian Space Research Organisations (Isros) Mars orbiter spacecraft, launched on November 5, was nudged out of Earth orbit early today to begin its 10-month journey towards Mars. The Mars mission has led some activists to question the wisdom of a planetary exploration mission by a nation struggling with poverty, inadequate drinking water, and health care. This mission is symbolic of misplaced policy and scientific priorities in an unequal society, said Harsh Mander, a social worker and director of the Centre for Equity Studies, New Delhi. This mission will not help Indias poor in the short or medium term. But senior Isro officials point out that the Mars mission has cost only about Rs 450 crore over three years, less than a tenth of the Rs 4,880 crore Isro spent during fiscal 2012-13 alone. Besides, they say, the space programme has helped millions of people across India in ways that are not always, or widely, appreciated. Its projects have helped put fish on the table, ensure bank ATM machines reliably roll out cash, save lives through search-and-rescue operations and early cyclone warnings, and arm many domestic industries with superior quality-control mechanisms. Some economic gains from the space programme  such as the amount of boat fuel saved or extra fish sold  are relatively easy to quantify. A study by the National Council for Applied Economic Research, New Delhi, suggests the annual economic benefits from satellite-based identification of PFZs is over Rs 34,000 crore, a sum close to what Indias space agency has spent over the past 10 years. You just cant put a value on some impacts, said Satheesh Shenoi, director of the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (Incois), Hyderabad, the institution that sends PFZ advisories thrice a week to 225 fishing harbours along Indias coastline. PFZ advisories are forecasts of fish abundance based on parameters such as ocean temperature, currents and plankton concentrations. Isros satellite-aided search-and-rescue system, responding to seven mid-sea distress calls, helped save 61 people last year. The success rate of finding hidden groundwater reservoirs has risen to 80 per cent with the use of satellite imagery, from the earlier 50 per cent when conventional methods were employed, Isro scientists say. Satellites allowed the Forest Survey of India to quickly detect several thousand forest fires in northern India last year. Isro officials say the space agency will continue to promote space technology for economic and social development, as envisioned by its earliest architects including the late Vikram Sarabhai and evident through the nationwide reach of space applications. The Indian programme was developed under the conviction that space capabilities should be used to uplift the lives of people, Bhupendra Jasani, a professor and space policy expert at Kings College London, told The Telegraph. To a large extent, these ideals have been fulfilled and it would be natural to move forward and use the technology for exploration. The Mars mission should be viewed in this light. Isro officials point out that 90 per cent of the space budget goes into the development of telecommunications, weather, and Earth-observation satellites and launch vehicles. Since its early years, the space programme has been encouraging Indian industry to develop components and subsystems for its satellites and launch vehicles. Isro officials estimate that some 500 companies are now contributing to the programme. The rigorous demands placed by the space agency has helped industries improve manufacturing processes and quality control. These gains have enabled many private companies to bid for outsourcing contracts for the global aerospace industry, said V. Siddhartha, a former space department official who has also had nearly two decades of experience in the department of research and development organisation. The technological experience that HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Limited) gained from its work with Isro has been a significant factor in HALs ability to forward-engineer into the stringent reliability and quality-control requirements of the fighter aircraft Tejas. Last year, Indias finance ministry and a consortium of public-sector banks contracted nine service providers to install and manage 63,000 bank ATMs across urban and rural India, many operating through satellite-based services. Hughes Communications India, a company contracted for 27,000 offsite ATMs, said in a media release last year that the secure satellite connectivity would provide uptimes (the durations for which the ATMs are operational) higher than 99.9 per cent. Outside the strategic or economic domains, satellite imagery is also used to predict yields of crops such as rice, wheat, potato and sugarcane. In less than four weeks, we can get a reliable estimate of the area under potato (cultivation) across the Indo-Gangetic plains, said Islam Ahmed, a mathematician at the Central Potato Research Institute, Meerut. Without satellites, reliable estimates arent available. A satellite-based telemedicine network connects 60 speciality hospitals to over 300 remote rural, district or mobile clinics. Doctors who have assessed one of these telemedicine hubs in Karnataka, however, say technical and non-technical factors are hampering the efficient use of the telemedicine services. The doctors from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, observed that fluctuating satellite bandwidth had led to breakdowns in tele-pathology and tele-radiology services. Their study, published last month in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine, also found that some doctors in remote clinics are at times reluctant to consult experienced doctors in the speciality hospitals."

Consumers who had been buying them for Rs 60-80 were marginally relieved as retail prices eased to Rs 35-40 per kg.Nearly 62,283 quintals (1 quintal equals 100kg) of onions arrived at state mandis, with an average price of Rs 15.96 per kg on Tuesday. Similarly, 18,507 quintals of potatoes came at Rs16.75 per kg. State government fair price shops sold onions for Rs 26 and tomatoes for Rs 32.Rates were marginally higher in the open market.

Tejas Patel of Dominance Impex said from Ahmedabad, ""It is true that 40% of Gujarat's previous tomato crop was destroyed by water-logging due to unseasonal rain during Navratra. But the new harvest is bountiful. In any case, our troubles have no impact on Mumbai as your city sources tomatoes from Nashik.

We also appeal to the government, local bodies and residents to help us open our fair price vegetable shops in the city,"" Akhil said.The peasant organization said it plans to set up at least 20 fair price vegetable shops in Guwahati and five each in every district.""We have also submitted a memorandum to chief minister Tarun Gogoi for allotting us land so that we can set up fair price vegetable shops on a permanent basis. We have informed the government about our plan to come up with an ethnic food and handicraft park in the city. The park will provide a platform to people from different ethnic groups to sell their agricultural and handicraft items in the city. We have requested the chief minister to allot unused government land for the park,"" Akhil said.The KMSS also threatened to occupy farmlands, which are being used for non-agricultural activities in Kamrup district, if the government fails to free those areas by December 15.""If the agricultural lands are not freed from their present owners, we will occupy those areas and settle flood-hit people there. The owners who have procured farmlands and are using them for non-farming activities would have to return the plots to the farmers, who originally owned the lands,"" Gogoi said."

Cattle feed and fodder expenditures constitute the bulk (almost 75 per cent) of the total cost of milk production. We have already increased payment to milk producers by Rs 2.46 per litre from December 1 to help them cope with increased spending, assistant general manager (marketing), Comfed, Rajiv Verma told The Telegraph over phone from Patna.He also made it clear that the price hike was not a result of increase in fuel costs.Sudha Dairy supplies nearly 3.5 lakh litres of milk to Jharkhand.But if homemakers are planning to bank on Medha milk from now on, they should not raise their hopes too high. State animal husbandry deputy director Mukul Prasad said on Wednesday they were also set for a price hike soon.We are sending a proposal to the state dairy board. The hike will be similar to that of Sudha, said Prasad, who also happens to be the director of Jharkhand State Milk Producers Co-operative Federation, which was floated a few months ago on the lines of Bihars Comfed.The hike is expected to be announced in a week.The residents are obviously unhappy.Just when we were hoping for some relief as prices of onions and potatoes are on the slide, the hike in milk prices will take us back to square one, said Sangeeta Sharma, a 38-year-old homemaker of Kasidih, Jamshedpur."

Since Tuesday, Sudha Dairy is charging an additional Rs 2 per litre for milk and its products. Medha, a part of the Jharkhand Dairy Project, has also announced an equal hike, to be effective from December 9. Local milkmen, too, have started charging more in the city.The price hike has added to the woes of residents at a time when they are struggling with the rising prices of essential products. Medha offcials blame increased transportation and processing charges for the rise in prices. However, these are not applicable for local milkmen whose charges, sometimes as high as Rs 28 to Rs 30 per litre depending on the location, has left homemakers fuming.On Thursday, a local milkman, Bhola Yadav (name changed) said, ""This was inevitable due to an escalation in the prices of essential commodities. We also have to compete with the market and feed our family."" The city's homemakers are facing the heat. Jayanti, a local, said, ""This is unfair. Earlier, onions and potatoes were unaffordable, and now it is milk. I understand the reason behind the cooperatives' hike, but why have local milkmen followed suit?

On Thursday we sent 80,000kg of the Jyoti variety of potatoes to around 200 markets in the city and on the fringes. These potatoes are being sold at Rs 13 a kg, said an official of the task force constituted by the chief minister to monitor the prices of essential edibles in city markets. Sources in the task force said Mamata Banerjee was displeased when she heard that her officials had discontinued the sale of potatoes through government departments without informing her. The sale was stopped on November 23. At a meeting of the task force on Tuesday, the chief minister is said to have asked who had stopped the sale of potatoes and why were the prices soaring again. She was very angry when she came to know that potato prices were rising again despite the state having adequate stock, said the source. Following the rap, the task force members met again and decided to resume selling potatoes through the agriculture marketing and horticulture departments. We have decided to sell potatoes till the prices come down again. Anybody caught selling the Jyoti variety at a price higher than Rs 13 a kg will be penalised, said an official. Over the past week, the Jyoti variety was being sold at Rs 16 a kg and Chandramukhi between Rs 20 and Rs 22 a kg. An unusual spike in potato prices in October-November had forced the government to intervene and sell potatoes at Rs 13 a kg in November. But once the government discontinued selling potatoes after the prices stabilised and panic among buyers subsided with the arrival of fresh produce, prices started to soar again.

The winter delicacy, which was available till last year for Rs 30 to 35 per kg is now fetching not less that Rs 60 to 70 per kg in the retail markets across the city. Only a few vendors in the city are buying garadu which are as less as 2-3 quintals in the mandi.

Traders and vendors attributed the nearly 30% drop in vegetable prices to the rise in supply.Local traders and commission agents in the wholesale market said that the supply of vegetables increased in winter and there is a fresh income of vegetables which has decreased the prices. Also, the variety of fresh and green vegetables available has increased. A buyer during the winter has a lot of variety on his platter. He gets fresh cauliflower, cabbage, spinach, methi, green peas along with other vegetables.The arrival of new vegetables from the local market has also played a major role in reducing the prices of the vegetables. ""The potato prices which had once crossed Rs 30 mark has now come down to Rs 20 as the local potatoes have arrived,"" said Paresh Shah a vendor in Navrangpura. ""After monsoon, sowing of vegetable takes place and during the winter the crop arrives bringing down the prices. The arrival of vegetables from the state has reduced the prices and with good monsoon, there is a possibility that the prices may fall further,"" said Deepak Patel, secretary of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Ahmedabad.However, market officials said the prices of vegetables as compared to December 2012 were about 10 -15% higher because of the increased cost of transportation.The APMC officials said that the new crop arrival began in November, but the retailers have not rolled back the prices as expected.Citing an example, the APMC office bearer pointed out that the cauliflower was about 6-10 per kg in wholesale, but by the time it reached the houses, it cost Rs 25 per kg. Similarly, Radish, which costs about Rs six per kg in the wholesale market, was sold at Rs 15-20 in the retail market. ""The price in the wholesale market has reduced and become stable, but the retailers have not reduced the prices as expected.

The food articles inflation rate rose to an over three-year high of 19.93 per cent in November.Vegetable prices shot up more than 95 per cent compared to about 80 per cent increase in October, government data showed.The higher headline inflation print comes on the back of last weeks all-time high retail inflation number of 11.24 per cent, putting a renewed pressure on the government to augment supply side responses and leaving a little room for the Reserve Bank of India to have a re-think on the interest rate hike in its December 18 monetary policy.The food articles inflation rate rose to an over three-year high of 19.93 per cent in November. The rise in prices of vegetables, potato, milk and cereals pushed up food articles inflation. Potato prices rose close to 31 per cent on month in November, while those of overall vegetables surged nearly 11 per cent. Onion prices continued to decline in November, with prices falling over 5 per cent month-on-month.Most economists said the overall WPI inflation rate in November was spiked by the rise in food prices, but they expect food prices to moderate hereon. Analysts also wondered that in a year of record food grain production, the country has been facing rise in food prices. Experts said the offloading of procured food grains has not happened giving rise to food inflation.Headline inflation for September too was revised upwards to 7.05 per cent from the earlier estimate of 6.46 per cent. The RBI is due to announce its mid-quarter review of monetary policy on Wednesday. Last week, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said the central bank was ""very uncomfortable"" with the current levels of inflation. Rajan has presented two monetary policy reviews, and has raised the key policy repo rate, by 25 bps in each of them.""We hope RBI will take due cognisance of the fact that growth is still feeble and needs support,"" industry chamber Ficci said.To curb food inflation, there is a need for urgent remedial measures for augmenting agriculture supplies with steps such as implementation of the model APMC Act, developing advanced supply chains, CII said.Inflation has become a politically sensitive issue and the Congress has suffered a drubbing in four state assembly elections largely on this issue."
449,Run away prices,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/374967/run-away-prices.html,2013-12-16,Deccan Herald,"Run away pricesDec 17, 2013: 22:32 ISTMore unconventional territory lies ahead for RBI and the government, with headline inflation or the wholesale price index (WPI) for November touching a 14-month high of 7.53 per cent, led by rising costs of vegetables, non-food primary articles and energy.Within the WPI, food inflation was at 19.9 per cent and prices of non-food articles accelerated 7.6 per cent. And, within food inflation, prices of vegetables rose 95.25 per cent in November as compared to 78.38 per cent in October. Prices of primary articles rose 15.9 per cent. Pressure will pile up on the government to rein in surging food prices as economic sloth has touched a decadal low, not to mention the agony of living up the drubbing it sustained in last week's elections to five states.A key reason for high food inflation in the past few months is the government pushing in more money into the minimum support price regime without a concomitant increase in productivity. With the new crop coming to the market, vegetable prices have eased a bit, especially potato and onion -- the latter has halved to Rs 13-15 a kg. However, vegetable prices are still about 10-15 per cent higher than 14 months ago, and onion prices could be arrested as more supplies flow in and exports pick up. Consequently, the WPI could look much better in December, though food inflation is by no means a phenomenon which accurately reflects supply conditions. Hoarding by vegetable stockists is rampant and government officials are still helpless in choking the deviousness of the trade. While core inflation has held steady in November, it can be affected by the continuing passthrough of the depreciating rupee. Energy-related inflation has also picked up to 11.1 per cent from 10.3 per cent in October, while manufacturing goods inflation hovers at around 2.5 per cent.As Milton Friedman said, inflation everywhere is a monetary phenomenon; though, its structural imbalances are exacerbated by poor agricultural productivity and changing food consumption patterns spurred by rising income levels. Indias structural reforms have not helped ease broader supply-side constraints, which adds to underlying inflationary pressures. These are key components of the inflation story which RBI will seek to rewrite, most likely through another hike. While higher food supplies can anchor WPI inflation in December and into March next year, the high CPI and steady core inflation numbers, and the outcome of any Fed tapering will require more than just pre-emptive tightening of RBI's monetary stance vis-a-vis interest rates."

Just after the recently held elections the prices of vegetables significantly decreased. While the traders have attributed the price decrease to rise in supply, Congress party has termed it as a political move.Onions which were selling at Rs 60 per kilo before the state elections (December 1) came down to Rs 30 per kg the very next day. On Tuesday they were selling at Rs 15-20 per kg in the wholesale market. Similarly, seasonal vegetables like spinach and carrot are down by Rs 10-15 per kg from the earlier price of Rs 30-40 per kg.Tomatoes, which sold for anything between Rs 50-60 per kg, are now available for 25-30 per kg in the wholesale market. Just a month ago, potatoes were selling at Rs 50 a kg, they are now available for Rs 15-20 per kg in the retail market.Local traders and commission agents in the wholesale market, Muhana Mandi said that the supply of vegetables has increased in winters which has decreased the prices. Also, availability of fresh and green vegetables has increased. A consumer during the winter season has plenty of vegetables to choose from such as cauliflower, cabbage, spinach, fenugreek, peas and other vegetables.""Winters are generally good season for the consumers. Also, new crop from Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat has started arriving here. The rates, however, are likely to remain static for December and January with some minor fluctuations,"" said Radhey Shyam Phatak, president of the Wholesaler Dealer Association.The issue of decreasing prices has not gone down well with the Congress party. ""The increase in the vegetable prices was one of the strongest issues used by BJP to woo the voters during their election campaign. But suddenly it came down after the elections. This is something that needs to be probed,"" said former CM Ashok Gehlot."

I am all for heralding the arrival of Ikea, Walmart, Carrefour and the like to our shores and giving us a taste, at last, of the choicest of fresh foodstuffs, a variety of world famous labels and an abundance of top notch and select merchandise.But I discovered the other day, the appeal and charm of my neighbourhood grocery store. Located under an ancient, massive banyan tree a few blocks away from my house, I chanced upon it again after quite some time. As I ventured up the small steps under a pair of faded awnings, I saw a row of familiar, large glass jars full of orange sweets we used to savour in our school days.Alongside were placed little packets of sugarcoated, multicolored fennel seeds and churan balls, all reminiscent of childhood. With the expensive, glitzy, attractively packaged chocolates and sweetmeats available these days I had completely forgotten these old childhood favourites.Once inside, I was pleasantly surprised at the well-lit and air-cooled interior. Along the walls were shelves lined with neatly packed pulses and an array of the latest and most popular toiletries. There was displayed an astonishing variety of foreign cereals, biscuits and confectionaries.The little store was well stocked and could easily give the big multinationals a run for their money. Behind the counters were two neatly dressed young girls, handing out and packing goods.A deep freezer hummed in a corner. It was crammed with different types of imported cheese, chocolates and cans of exotic juices.The portly, beaming owner, hurried towards me. All smiles and anxious to help, he piled my shopping in a cardboard box and offered to have it delivered home, all the while asking after my family and children.Without requiring the help of a fancy calculating machine, he prepared my bill in no time, showcasing the famed Indian acumen for mental mathematics and then rounded off the total in my favour!In contrast, the big, best price stores, with their aggressive marketing and visibility suddenly seemed sterile and remote. Usually located a good distance from the city, their approach requires planning and a good deal of effort. Their massive, identical aisles are daunting and ideal spots to lose your way, and your bearings. Negotiating a trolley through the maze of giant, lofty columns laden with a mind boggling variety of merchandise is no mean task.Also invariably one tends to overspend and end up lugging home, scores of toothbrushes, dozens of tissue boxes and vast quantities of potato chip packets, all quite unnecessary! The interminably long queues at the cash counter and endless checking and rechecking of purchased goods is exasperating to say the least.The efforts our local shopkeepers are making to keep up with foreign competition is laudable to say the least and I am confident that these massive conglomerates may come and go but our shops around the corner are definitely going to survive and will continue to flourish."
457,Low supply pushes up potato price  ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131220/jsp/odisha/story_17699686.jsp,2013-12-20,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, Dec. 19: Potato, which was selling at Rs 12 a kilo a fortnight ago, today touched Rs 20 a kg in the retail market. With the state government yet to explore alternative sources of procuring potato, traders fear it would cross Rs 25 in a day or two as supply was low. Today, I bought it for Rs 22 for a kg, said Baramunda resident Subhadra Mohanty. After Phailin and floods, potato prices skyrocketed in the state to almost Rs 100 per kg. The situation got aggravated due to a ban on potato supply by the Bengal government. Prices dropped to around Rs 12 a kilo after the Bengal government allowed export of one lakh tonnes of potato to Odisha. But, the supply stopped from December 16 after the quota of one lakh tonnes was complete and the market has started showing the same kind of signs with the price showing an upward trend. Secretary of the Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said the Bengal government stopped further supply of potato to Odisha and detained the Odisha-bound trucks. The Bengal government not only stopped the supply, but also detained our trucks loaded with tuber. Unless the government here takes pro-active steps we will suffer like this, said Panda. Ajay Biswal, president of the Perishable Goods Association in Balasore, said around 400 potato-laden Odisha-bound trucks were stuck between Dantan and Calcutta as the Bengal government was not allowing exports. A trader said the state could procure potato from states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand if the government wanted. Too much dependency on Bengal has created the problem. Besides the traders are of the view that they could have procured potato from other states, but the people here preferred Bengal tuber. Sources said Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee was shortly going to take a decision on supply of potato to Odisha. Secretary of the state food supply and consumer welfare department Madhusudan Padhee said there was no formal communication from the Bengal government about stopping supply. I have heard that some of our trucks have been detained. But, the situation is not that bad to result in price escalation. Yesterday, we had short supply, but today, around 20 trucks have arrived. It is the handiwork of traders, who are responsible for the price rise. We are keeping a watch on the situation. Hopefully arrival of new supplies will reduce the prices, said Padhee."

On the one hand they (United States, Japan) give huge subsidies to agriculture and on the other put pressure on us to reduce subsidies. We demand that we be given a free hand to increase our subsidy, Mr. Panda said during his address.He said the general elections were round the corner and demanded that the parties give space and priority to agricultural issues in their manifestos.Demanding that investment in agriculture be increased to 10 per cent of the GDP, he sought a separate Ministry for Welfare.MSPIn tune with the recommendations of the M.S. Swaminathan Commissions report, the minimum support price should be based on the total cost of production. MSPs of paddy should be increased to Rs.2,000 per quintal. MSPs of food crops such as sugarcane, onion, potato should also be increased, he said.AIKS secretary Atul Kumar Anjan urged the audience to ensure a farmer-friendly Prime Minister was sworn in after the 2014 elections.We have a political and social agenda.

459,Veggie prices drop by one-third,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Veggie-prices-drop-by-one-third/articleshow/27744580.cms,2013-12-22,The Times Of India,"CHENNAI: With the easing of supply bottlenecks, vegetable prices have dropped over the last fortnight in the city.According to RBI's Mid Quarter Monetary Policy Review (December 2013), inflation fuelled by spiraling vegetable prices, particularly onion and potato, drove inflation to a record 7.52%, the highest in 14 months. Vegetable prices went up by 95% in November compared to 78% in October. The review also underscored the possibility of a sharp drop in the prices.By the second week of December, vegetable prices had ceased to scare customers. The diminutive 'sambar onion' priced at 90 per kg in November was being sold at 40 on Friday. Price of onion at the Koyambedu wholesale market has been slashed by 40% because of the arrival of new crop from Maharashtra and Karnataka, said Vegetable Market Association advisor V R Soundararajan.There has been a 30% decrease in the prices of all vegetables except drumstick, added Soundararajan. Pointing out the price of vegetables at the wholesale market, he said potatoes selling at 40-45 a kg had come down to 30 a kg while there has been a 50% decrease in the price of cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, cucumber, green chilli, beans and brinjal.On Friday morning, around 400 trucks each with 10 to 15 tonnes of vegetables arrived at Koyambedu. ""Robust supply means plenty of fresh stock and prices may decrease further,"" said Soundararajan.Earlier the cost of vegetables increased because of the transport logjam following the anti-Telangana stir. With the roads being opened, the prices have come down, said Sivaraman from Rason Green Store in T Nagar. The retail price of tomatoes has dropped and is 20-25 a kg, he said adding that the decrease in price meant brisk business.Customers are relieved. M Kumarsamy, a customer at a Reliance Fresh outlet, said he did not have to think twice before purchasing vegetables.For some small vendors, business has still to pick up pace. ""Despite the decrease in price, sales have been stagnant. I hope it improves in the next few days,"" said K Kumar, a vendor at T Nagar."
460,NH-33 lands with egg on its face ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131223/jsp/jharkhand/story_17709134.jsp,2013-12-23,Telegraph,"Workers with crates of unbroken eggs at wholesaler KD Singhs shop on Old Hazaribagh Road in Ranchi on Sunday. Picture by Hardeep Singh The pot-holed National Highway 33 has hatched a heartbreak this Yuletide season. Eggs, the number one ingredient to make cakes soft and spongy that bakers and foodies swear by, are cracking inside crates on trucks from Hyderabad trundling along the cratered highway. As more eggs crack on NH-33 before they reach the capital, wholesalers are forced to jack up rates from Rs 48 per dozen in November to Rs 56 now. A tray of 30 eggs costs Rs 133 in the wholesale market. In a domino effect, retailers are forced to hike the price of eggs to around Rs 65 per dozen or Rs 140 and above per tray. For bakeries and homemakers, the choice is between the devil and the deep sea. Add less number of eggs in the cake batter to save money and literally hit Xmas revelry hard. Or else, add enough eggs to bake soft and tasty cakes that leave a bitter taste in the mouth due to cost. There is no crisis of production in Hyderabad, the main hub of egg production. The inflation in egg rates is due to bad roads, especially on NH-33, on which trucks laden with eggs come to Ranchi. Ill advise revellers to purchase eggs in trays and not by the dozen, K.D. Singh, a well-known egg wholesaler on Old Hazaribagh Road in Ranchi said. He added the bumpy ride causes fragile eggshells to crack, resulting in waste. Rise in price of eggs in this season is unfortunate but if the powers-that-be repair the NH-33 these problems would automatically cease, Singh said. Sarfaraz Hussain of Jharkhand Egg Traders on Lake Road has kept the wholesale price for 12 eggs at Rs 60 and a tray at Rs 133. Hussain said they needed to make up for the loss they faced due to damaged eggs. The NH-33 is in such bad shape that we cant commit bulk deliveries to retailers unless trucks reach Ranchi. When they do, many eggs are found broken, he said. Imtiyaz Ali, a retailer, who buys egg trays from Hussain, said everyone was hit hard. I sell eggs for Rs 62 to 65 a dozen. For trays, the price is Rs 140. We keep the price on the higher side because an egg is always prone to damage. It remains to be seen how bakers manage the price rise  reduce the number of eggs in their cakes or try vegetarian substitutes. But many homemakers are adamant on a no-compromise policy. Christmas comes once a year. I will not compromise on the number of eggs in my cake mixes, said Manasi Biswas, a mother of two who stays in New Nagratoli and bakes cakes at home for her family as well as for her friends. She added the middle classes had become immune to the years ups and downs. First, it was onions, then potatoes and now eggs. But egg yolks give cakes their flavour and whites the fluffiness, smiled the seasoned baker."
461,'Sunburn is not just a music festival-it's a lifestyle',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Sunburn-is-not-just-a-music-festival-its-a-lifestyle/articleshow/27760443.cms,2013-12-23,The Times Of India,"At the crazy rate at which Sunburn has grown, it could not have been held at a space-compromised location like Candolim. We are very excited about our new venue at Vagator-not only is it ten times larger, but the view of the sunset is spectacular, and will lend our festival a 'drama angle'. Another high comes from the landscaping of the sprawling site. It has flat land, gentle grassy slopes and even its own rocky cliff, where the biggest stage will be set up.The Goa government has been incredibly supportive. If anything is annoying , it's when we are compared to smaller EDM festivals that are not remotely in the same league. But Sunburn is definitely something that the Goa government should 'celebrate'-we are ranked the no. 4 music festival in the world, and not just on the basis of size. We have music-lovers from 36 countries converging on Goa just for Sunburn-I mean, tourism ministries have entire budgets only to accomplish this kind of thing.I have converted thousands of skeptics into EDM lovers. Besides, this year, 50% of our venue will be occupied by the Sunburn lifestyle section-it will be a place where our guests can just be themselves. Bungee jumping, rappelling and rock-climbing, hot air balloon rides, 'Sunburn cruises' on fancy yachts- the festival has a range of adventure sports activities on offer. Sports-lovers can play table tennis, volleyball and football, the couch potatoes will probably make a bee-line to our large open-air cinema theatre. Dance machines, a library, a flea market, a kite-festival and even a VIP foam party-our guests have plenty of options apart from the main show. And then, there's the food-from momos to pizzas and Goan delicacies-all our food will be locally sourced to give more business to Goan entrepreneurs.For the first time, we will set up a beautiful artist's village-each of our performing artists will have their own tent where they can hang out and catch up with each other. At events like these, the artists usually just come, play and run away. This village will lend a cooler vibe-there will be a DJ console for them to jam and play for each other, a rejuvenation centre and a live kitchen. A few privileged fans (chosen through a contest three days before the festival) will get to enter this village and hang out with the artists.Not really, Vagator is the central point of North Goa's coastline, and merges the best of both sides. There is zero limitation on accommodation here, and for the first time, we are going to have camping on-site. We are still working out permission for this facility, but once it comes through, guests can reserve their tents on first come, first serve basis. There will however be a limited number of tents -though I have reserved one for myself; I am keen on staying at the venue this year.Sunburn may be Goa's biggest EDM festival, but Goa is not Sunburn's biggest-from January 2013, we have had 216 Sunburn events which each saw a turnout ranging from 500 to 35,000 guests.We had free-of-cost concerts for students at 52 college campuses across the country-from BITS Pilani to the IIMs and medical colleges as well. These were alcohol-free gigs though.Our next format was 'Sunburn Reloaded' for level-2 markets, reaching out to smaller cities and also the EDM fans who cannot afford to make it to the bigger festivals.We took a mix of national and international artists to 45 cities including Calicut, Lucknow, Allahabad, Vizag and Guwahati-and the response was insane.I was shocked when our Baroda event saw a turnout of 4,000 guests, and even Nagpur received 3,000-plus guests. Young people all over India enjoy music and sunshine. And finally, three massive 'Sunburn Arena' events at Bangalore, Mumbai and Noida featuring the biggest names on the global EDM scene-Swedish House Mafia, Avici, Hardwell, Cascade.In reality, this three-day year-ender festival in Goa is just the climax of a year chock-full of Sunburn events.I have always maintained that Sunburn is a 'glocal brand'-produced locally and consumed globally-it is already broadcast live in over 80 countries.We have already taken Sunburn to Sri Lanka and Dubai; next year we are planning to explore more of South East Asia.The explosion of Sunburn, in terms of popularity and size, has forced us to put Windsong on the backburner this year.We had to take a call to concentrate our financial resources, time and energy into Sunburn. In November, Percept launched 'Bollyboom', a festival of Bollywood Electronic Music in Delhi, and it was a tremendous success."
462,"Rationing, the answer to today’s food crises?",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/rationing-the-answer-to-todays-food-crises/article5499470.ece,2013-12-25,The Hindu,"Presumably, youre already totally sickened by the excesses of Christmas as a gift-giving ceremony, and your goodwill to others has been leached out of you by the size of the queue outside Jo Malone (10 minutes of your life, scorched, in the quest for a candle that smells).Ive now got two excellent phrases to spoil your Christmas dinner and turn the marshmallow-topped sweet potato to ash in your mouth: obesity crisis and food bank. Theyre actually related, you know. But not in the way Richard Littlejohn would have us believe, that people who go to food banks only eat chips.In the new year, the Overseas Development Institute is to publish Future Diets: Implications for Agriculture and Food Prices , behind which rather dry title lie some eye-popping figures about global obesity. One interesting line of inquiry, though, is what successfully combats obesity. The U.K. is a rare country for running the full gamut, from being a government initiative that did work to one that doesnt at all. That is, rationing in the Second World War, and the Change for Life campaign, which has been running since 2009, addressing a knowledge deficit that doesnt exist (obesity specialists are pretty well united on the fact that there are very few people who dont know a high-calorie foodstuff from a low one).Its always presented as a happy accident, one of those cute paradoxes in which the WWII specialised, that rationing, in a bid to stop us starving, also stopped us getting fat. In fact, while obesity may not have featured in the planning, this isnt an accident: in order to be the kind of government that can effect that kind of public health improvement, you have to start by being the kind of government that cares whether or not your people are hungry. You have to be the kind of government that takes what people are putting on their tables every night as its most urgent and pressing business.At the end of rationing (which was incredibly unpopular, lets not forget  nobody enjoys being told how much bacon theyre allowed) not only was there much less obesity, but other indicators of a nations health  birth weight, infant mortality  also improved. At a recent Womens Institute history night, I saw for the first time a full list of what the rations actually were.I concluded ruefully that they were so meagre (one egg a week, 50g of butter) that I dont think Id bother eating, Id just live on protein powder and alcohol. But thats not the point; when one discusses rationing, its in the context of national circumstances so straitened that everybody simply had to eat less, because there wasnt enough. But the next stage of that logical process is never discussed, which is that it was a fear, really, of the poor not having enough that led to a policy for everyone. Circumstances werent so dire that rich people would have starved, or even people in the middle.The concerns were: a]. scarcity would falsely inflate prices, so people who could previously afford to eat would be priced out; and b]. people would hoard. The hoarding point is interesting as it gives the lie to a narrative often tacitly peddled, that human nature during the war was better than it is now, more self-sacrificing, less demanding, more generous.But more important is that point about prices  all markets favour the rich. In times of scarcity, though, the poor are disadvantaged by an amount so stark that you cant count it. Whatever the price is, the entire point is that it will be too much for that group, so that demand is reduced and supply at the top can remain at normal levels. Its like a bully holding a boys satchel constantly 5 cm higher than he can jump. That much was obvious in the 1940s, and you would hope it would be again today, unless 30 years of neoliberalism has totally hollowed out our sense of reason.In that era, food was a manifestation  perhaps the central manifestation  of solidarity. Rather than deal with the threat of starvation as it happened, with emergency food parcels and people slipping through the net, that government dealt with it pre-emptively, and it worked. People didnt starve, and they ended up healthier, and our parents were born slightly bigger, which accounts for why they need their ginormous baby-boomer houses.Contrast that with food banks today: obviously the situation is slightly different, since the scarcity is not of food but of money, and it has been wilfully created by the government by unjust benefit sanctions and maladministration. Nevertheless, people are hungry, and rather than answer that with a call to act collectively, to sacrifice collectively, we are asked to maybe give a tin of kidney beans as we pass through Tesco, reflecting as we go on the tendency of the poor to mismanage their finances, or peoples limitless desire for things that are free (and Lord Freud). However, while the hungry are, of course, hit hardest by the modern solipsism, it makes change impossible all the way through society so that it hits us all. We all get fatter, and there are no public health levers, because the levers that work are the ones wherein were all in it together as a demonstrable fact, and not just nauseating rhetorical guff.Across the world there are other things that work; in Denmark, a solid resistance to corporate interests has led to the healthiest McDonalds and KFC recipes of any country. In South Korea, a mass education programme has led to the consumption of insane amounts of vegetables.You dont have to ration people to one egg a week to be a big government; but you do have to be a big government to make a big difference.   Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2013The lesson from the 1940s is that to fix a public health problem  be it obesity or hunger  you need big government"
463,1200 tons of apples and potatoes rot in Uttarkhand,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1200-tons-of-apples-and-potatoes-rot-in-Uttarkhand/articleshow/27871831.cms,2013-12-25,The Times Of India,"DEHRADUN: Around 1200 tons of apples and potatoes have rotted in areas affected by the June flash floods in Uttarkhand as the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN) could not move them to the markets due to poor connectivity of roads.Many roads are still not in a passable state in the region. The GMVN has suffered huge losses.GMVN's general manager of marketing Pratap Shah said, ""GMVN had no option but to comply with the Government Order issued in August this year where we were asked to buy the apple at the minimum support price of Rs 30 and potato at Rs 15 per kg from the farmers in Uttarkashi, Tehri, Pauri, Chamoli, Rudraprayag and Chakrata districts to support farmers and protect the produce. We employed a large workforce to collect the produce and stock them up in vacant houses. But it became difficult to transport it to markets in most cases because of bad roads.""He said that the alternate option of carrying the stock on mules and horses was unviable and very expensive. In some cases they hired vehicles but that proved expensive as drivers quoted higher prices to navigate broken roads. As a result most of the stock perished after lying piled up for months together and the remaining one is not saleable either.He added the corporation suffered huge losses as the state government would pay only 25 % of the total amount, spent by GMVN in purchasing the bulk stock.GMVN's managing director Rajesh Kumar said, ""The state government selected us for the project as GMVN had its property and staff in remote places in the region. The objective of the project was noble as it was aimed at supporting the farmers who were devastated by the disaster and had no clue how to sell their produce. They were paid good minimum support price. But the entire project turned out to be a losing proposition for GMVN."""
464,Bittersweet year in economy ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1131227/jsp/northeast/story_17724797.jsp,2013-12-27,Telegraph,"Guwahati, Dec. 26: The rupee volatility affected trade in the Northeast, much like it did in other parts of the country, even as business grew by leaps and bounds in sectors such as retail, manufacturing and construction in the year that was. Consumer sentiments were hit further as food inflation soared in October-November during which the price of onions pushed an unprecedented century and that of potato fifty. But by mid-December, the two most wanted edibles settled at Rs 30 (onion) and Rs 25 (potato) in the retail market, with fresh supplies making way to the region from Maharashtra and Gujarat. Retail foreign exchange business felt the heat in August as the rupee weakened. Full-fledged money changers particularly were hit hard, albeit for a brief period, with profit margins of some going down by almost 50 per cent. It has been a difficult year for the industry and economy throughout and companies with innovative strategies have somehow been able to make some headway. There has been a liquidity crunch, cost of financing has gone up and government spending has shown a declining trend, R.S. Joshi, the chairman of Federation of Industry and Commerce of North Eastern Region, said. Later in the year, the tea industry had something to cheer about, with the countrys third largest tea packeteer, Wagh Bakri, announcing its plan to buy gardens in Assam. The idea, as Piyush Desai, the managing director of Wagh Bakri, says is to have control over kitchen. The company wants to acquire three to five gardens having a production of 1 to 1.5 million kg. At the same time, the company is looking for proposals from owners of medium/small tea gardens. It will be a win-win situation and there will be equity partnership between the producers and our company, Desai told The Telegraph. The biggest news came from the cement sector when Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd became the largest company in the Northeast after it acquired two units  a 76 per cent stake in Calcom Cement Limited and full ownership of Adhunik Cement, including a 25MW captive power plant for Rs 1,085 crore. Local cement companies, for their part, went innovative on brand promotion and market penetration, braving the recessionary trend and overcoming high input costs. The retail real estate market size of the Northeast grew by over Rs 11,000 crore, with Guwahati leading the way with a share of over Rs 4,000 crore, followed by Agartala at Rs 2,000 crore. Shristi Housing Development Pvt. Ltd, a subsidiary of the Calcutta-based Srei group, invested about Rs 60 crore on a shopping-cum-office complex at Agartala. In Guwahati, Shristi set the ball rolling for the Northeasts first private sector integrated township at Ramsa Hills. The Rs 3,000-crore project will have residential villas, multi-storied buildings, educational institutions, hotels and theme parks. In May, Sakshi Agro Beverage, a beverage company in Amingaon on the outskirts of Guwahati, forayed into the aerated drinks market for the first time in the Northeast. Despite the slowdown in the automobile industry, companies recorded a decent growth. Car-makers came up with improved grades while two-wheeler companies tapped untapped areas. Apparel majors Turtle, Allen Solly and Van Heusen went bullish with the brand-conscious consumer not giving in to inflation. The year also saw a booming bakery business  particularly in Guwahati  Prime Bakes opened six outlets, Loyans added two more and Delice opened shop at Hengrabari and Bamunimaidam."
465,Rate hiked as HC order cut cheap CNG supply: IGL,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Rate-hiked-as-HC-order-cut-cheap-CNG-supply-IGL/articleshow/28023123.cms,2013-12-28,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: The fourth and biggest increase in the price of CNG in Delhi this year has left CM-designate Arvind Kejriwal holding the political hot potato of an auto fare hike. But even as Kejriwal promises to look into the issue of a possible price rollback, Indraprastha Gas Ltd, the sole CNG distributor in the capital, declined to comment on the issue on Friday.This year, the price of CNG has increased in the city by 30.6%, from Rs 38.35/kg at the start of the year to Rs 50.1/kg now. IGL claims a strengthening dollar and increasing dependence on imported regasified-liquid natural gas (RLNG) that costs four times as much as domestic gas necessitated the price hikes. But the latest hike, it says, was also made necessary by a 5% reduction in the allocation of cheaper domestic gas to Delhi and the NCR following a Gujarat High Court order.Explaining the approximately 10% price hike on Thursday, IGL said its share of domestic gas has reduced after the Centre decided to reallocate gas produced in India equitably to all the city gas distribution (CGD) companies across the country. Before the Gujarat HC order forced the Centre to take this stand, GAIL-promoted Indraprastha Gas in Delhi and Mahanagar Gas in Mumbai received a larger share of domestic gas.""The prices of imported gas have been on the rise recently and new imported gas quantities are available in the market at much higher prices than the existing ones,'' said an IGL official, adding that the company's overall input cost has increased by over 13%."
466,Birhor families wait for government aid in winter,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/Birhor-families-wait-for-government-aid-in-winter/articleshow/28086970.cms,2013-12-29,The Times Of India,"RAMGARH: More than a dozen families in Birhor Tola, a small tribal village in Ramgarh, light bonfires every evening, sit together and wait for the chill to go off. They also wait for government relief.As mercury level dips in the state to as low as 10C, these families, belonging to the primitive Birhor tribe, find it difficult to keep themselves warm. With no warm clothes or blankets, Birhor men, women and children depend on bonfires to survive in wintry nights.""We collect coal from nearby coal dumps of Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) and go to the forest in search of wood,"" said Kailu Birhor, a resident of Birhor Tola under Vasantpur panchayat in Mandu block.The villagers were provided blankets two years ago. ""But those have worn out and we are waiting for some help so that we can sleep inside our huts in thi cold,"" said Mangar Birhor of the same village.Birhors live in groups, called 'tanda', in a cluster of six to seven cone-shaped huts known a 'kumba' made of leaves and branches. They make new shelters every three weeks. Both Birhor men and women are skilled hunters, though hunting has been restricted these days.But government projects in the forests, aggressive mining and government intervention in the natural habitat of the tribe have collectively affected the Birhors. ""It is clear why Birhors have been deprived for so long... because of government and corporate interests in massive mineral reserves in the forest,"" said Jhaman Mahto, a social worker.District administration, however, claimed that government has always supported their cause and would come up with more schemes.""The government is trying its level best to support Birhors,"" said a block officer in Ramgarh. ""We make huts for them and also provide food for them. The government is planning to come up with more schemes for protecting them.""He said that only after the international community became concerned about the decreasing number of Birhor tribal people, the Indian government took action. The rehabilitation schemes were launched a few years ago, but without any particular study on the needs and requirements of the tribe.Most of young boys and men have migrated to different states in search of employment as there are no means of income generation for survival when prices of all essential commedities like rice and potatoes have soared, but neither block officials nor anybody else came to give us rice and potatoes to eat, Mangar said adding that most of men and women residing in the area were forced to beg for survival while some collect coal and firewood to generate income for the family.The government has been intervening in Jharkhand's forests for the purpose of starting mining and forestry projects for development. From the perspective of a tribe who relies solely on the forest for survival, this ""development"" adversely affects the ecology of the region-the natural habitat of the tribe, Amrendra Gupta, district president of Bhartiya Janta Party who hails from Mandu block said.""We have always undergone a lot of problems,"" admitted Bheekhu from the Birhor tribe and said. ""Life has always been tough and unfair to us."""
