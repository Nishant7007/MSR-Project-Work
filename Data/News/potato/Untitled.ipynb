       "'This story is from December 21, 2018Picture used for representational purpose onlyDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityJALANDHAR: Already battling with loses of the previous two years, the potato growers in Punjab are staring at another bad year with prices of the crop crashing to the bottom. Whats worse, some of the leftover stock of last year is still lying with them.The farmers claim that they are unable recover even their cost of production and harvesting as the price is down to Rs 3 per kg. When the harvesting of potatoes started, which are supplied directly in the market for domestic consumption, the price was at Rs 20-25 per kg. That was three weeks back, now it has crashed to Rs 3 a kg. While, Jalandhar is largely a seed producingbelt for the country, farmers here also harvest part of their crop for supplies in the local market, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha.Cost of production, harvesting and packing ranges from Rs 6 to 8. With selling price tumbling to Rs 3, and would not be surprising if farmers start ploughing their produce in their fields, said Kulwant Singh of village Qadianwal on the outskirts of Jalandhar.He said that some part of the last year crop meant for supply as seeds was still lying with them. Market for us has just not revived since demonetization. For third year in a row, we are set to fave huge loses, he said.Demonetisation was announced in the days when season for receiving orders was about to start. After the announcement, we received no orders from traders. The entire business was based on cash transactions and our biggest buyer is West Bengal. Even 2015 was also not very good for us, but last two years have been the worst as our buyers from other states were left with little cash, he said.Village Uggi resident Gurdeep Singh said that while he would be harvesting his entire crop in February for supply as seeds to others states but some part of his last year crop was still lying with him.Meanwhile, Sangha said that they had last year demanded that export to Pakistan be opened in the summer. Pakistan does not have cold storage facility and in the summers there potato prices remain high and we could have finished our stocks of previous season by supplying the produce to Pakistan. Now, there would be no benefit as their own fresh crop would flood the market, he said.Since demonetization, there has been no reprieve for potato growers and they are continuing to suffer. We cant give up potato cultivation easily as we have invested on implements and appliances, said Sangha and Kulwant.When contacted, deputy director (horticulture) Satbir Singh confirmed that prices were low.Doaba belt of Punjab mainly produces potato seed for major parts of the country and they did not receive good returns on their produce in the last two years. In these days only a part of the crop is harvested for supplies to local markets and their prices have also come down after the glut in the market, he said.'"
