File photo: C. VenkatachalapathyWith the start of a new year, affordable prices are something that many consumers would look for. For a week now, mixed prices are prevailing in the vegetable markets, as traders say that the price of few vegetables have shot up, while the cost of a few have dropped, and these rates are here to stay for at least another week.The last week of 2016 saw the price of some vegetables such as onions, beans and broad beans (avarakkai) shoot up due to various reasons, according to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The rates of beans and avarakkai have increased in the last two days. This is primarily because the quality of vegetables is good but the supply is less. Many consumers are purchasing the two vegetables and this has hiked the prices. These vegetables are supplied from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, he said.From costing Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 earlier, the rate of one kilo of beans has doubled toRs. 30 now, while the price of avarakkai has gone up from Rs. 15 to Rs. 25.All is not well with onions too. Mr. Balu said the onions supplied from Andhra Pradesh that were of medium size and even smaller used to be sold for Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 in Vellore.Now, the supply from AP has stopped, and onions from parts of Maharashtra such as Pune and Ahmednagar have started to arrive. Those procuring the stock have to pay Rs. 5 per kilo on commission and toll. So, onions are sold at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 to fetch profit, he said.He added that it would take at least a week for the price of onions supplied from Maharashtra to stabilise.Drumsticks rate has also gone up as the mist affected flowering and yield. It was sold for Rs. 80.The rate of peas, which are usually priced high, could come as a surprise. The price dropped from Rs. 80 to Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 last week, he said.While small onions (a kilo) costs Rs. 20, tomatoes are priced at Rs. 5 to Rs. 8. Potatoes cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 14, while ladys finger is priced at Rs. 25 to Rs. 30. The local thorny variety of brinjal is priced at Rs. 30 a kilo, while carrot is sold for Rs. 10.The rates of other vegetables are  cabbage  Rs. 6 to Rs. 8, ginger  Rs. 20 to Rs. 40, snake gourd  Rs. 12, bitter gourd  Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, pumpkin  Rs. 10, green chillies  Rs. 20 to Rs. 30, and coriander (a bunch)  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30.Coconut was sold for Rs. 5 to Rs. 8 (local), while those from Pollachi cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 20.The same rates will continue for a week, Mr. Balu said."

He was getting a pittance for his produce.""The tomatoes had ripened but nobody was ready to buy it at even at Rs 1 per kg.This was a big shock and I had no choice but to discard the produce,"" Patel bemoaned.The farmers growing tomatoes and potatoes are staring at a major crisis. While they are reaping a bumper crop, buyers are not ready pay a sustainable price for them.The wholesale price of tomatoes is Rs 1.07 per kg, which was Rs 4-5 per kg last year. For potatoes, last year farmers got Rs 10 per kg, while the tubers are selling for Rs 5 per kg this year.D M Patel, secretary of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) said that this year MP, which has had a bumper crop of tomatoes is supplying north India.""Last year, 80-100 trucks with 10 tonnes of tomatoes each would leave Gujarat every day. This is now just two trucks. With no exports to Pakistan, dealers from Punjab and Delhi are also conspicuous by their absence,"" he said.Ashish Guru, president of Gujarat Cold Storage Association , said, ""Anticipating that production would be high this year, we were holding talks with the government and Gujarat was the first state to announce a transport subsidy even before the arrival of the crop.""Kadvaji Thakore, a farmer from Dasanavas in Deesa has sown potatoes on some two bighas of land. ""This year, I am fearing major losses as the market forecast is not good,"" he said.Mavji Desai, chairman of Deesa APMC, the biggest market yard for trading of potatoes, said: ""This year we are expecting a very big crop of potatoes and are apprehending that the new crop, which will arrive in a week, will not fetch a good price."""

They have been hit as big- and middle-level traders are not coming to markets to strike the deals. The prices have crashed so much that even recovering costs is becoming a challenge, they say.Potato seed growers are saying that they are facing double whammy as the season of selling potato seeds in November was lost to demonetisation and the prevailing crisis seems to be an aftermath of it. Punjab produces good quality potato seeds which are sold across the country.""No traders is coming to purchase the fresh crop and prices have nosedived in local mandis. In November, when potato seeds were to be supplied, demonetisation came. Farmers from West Bengal, which was the main market to be catered at the time, had no cash and the growers and suppliers here refused to sell on credit. Even according to conservative estimates, over four lakh bags (50kg per bag) were left in the stores in Punjab,"" said Inderdeep Singh Grewal, a major potato grower from Saraba village near Ludhiana. ""I too suffered big loss in November despite owning a cold storage,"" he added.""In November, several small growers had already sold most part of their produce and the middle and big producers were badly hit. However, this time, it's theses small growers who are worst hit as they sell their produce directly in the local mandis and don't have financial capacity to store,"" said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association.""Most of the trading of potato crops is done in cash. Now traders are wary of making all transactions through banks,"" Sangha said. ""People are worried as to how would they return the crops loans,"" he added.""In Jalandhar, farmers had to sell potato at Rs 2 to 3 per kg which did not even make up the cost incurred on producing it leave aside its transportation or other charges like labour,"" Sangha said. ""We are considering to launch some protest or agitation to expose that how demonetisation has hit the farmers,"" he added.Grewal pointed out that the last two - three seasons were good for potato and the area under the crop also increased. ""This time production is good and if things don't improve a major part of the produce would simply left to be rotten,"" he said.Kala Sanghia-based potato grower Gurminder Singh, a middle-level grower, said that farmers were now striving to recover their costs only and even that seems to be an uphill task.""We don't have any money to sow maize crop and have no money to pay the land owners whose lands we have taken on annual contract,"" said Nawan Pind-based small farmer Mandeep Singh.

However, the dip is not reflecting in the Kolkata markets, with prices ranging between Rs 7 and Rs 9. So essentially, due to meddling by middlemen, potato retail price turns five times dearer while covering 60-odd kilometres from the farm to buyer.Sensing an imminent crisis, the Bengal government is set to offer minimum support price to potato farmers in the state to stop distress sale of the food crop. The department of agriculture marketing has asked 460 potato cold storages to keep 10% space reserved for government-procured potatoes.According to the agriculture marketing department, this year, a bumper potato harvest is expected in three major potato producing districts  Hooghly, Burdwan and Bankura and some blocks of other districts. The potato production, this year is pegged at 1.15 crore tonne in 4,500 hectres of land, compared to 90 lakh per tonne last year. A bumper production often leads to distress sale by farmers who fear rotting of the unsold crop in the field.According to the notification (245-AM/0/4C-05/2013) dated February 23, 2017, issued by the agriculture marketing department secretary R K Sinha, on the basis of the advise of cold storage expert committee, all cold storages were instructed to reserve 10% potato storage space for government-procured potatoes. This space will be at the disposal of the district magistrate till March 21. Significantly, the cold storage will be opened on March 1, 2017, for stocking of the potato of Rabi season.Both farmers and cold storage owners welcome this move. Chintamoni Santra of Pursura, the country's highest potato producing block, said, ""This year, I had potato-farming in 1.5 bigha land, which produces 90 packets per bigha. But I had to sell some of the produce at Rs 80-Rs 100 per packet, incurring a loss of almost Rs 100 per packet. If the government buys out some part of the produce, I will be relived of a huge stress.""Bengal's agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said: ""Our chief minister Mamata Banerjee has said farmers must not suffer and middlemen must not loot. This is why we are adopting such measures without disturbing the market equilibrium. Each Panchayat will prepare a list of potato farmers in potato producing districts.""Arijit Saha, the owner of Dhanekhali Cold Storage, feels positive about the decision. ""This will save the potato market to a great extent. A lot of farmers will have a breather. But the Panchayat must prepare the list of potato farmers on a war-footing."""

Despite good crop yield, they are not even able to recover the input cost of their produce.Uttar Pradesh witnessed an increase of about 20% this year in the areas under potato cultivation. There has been increased production as the weather too remained conducive, said Ram Saran Verma, a leading farmer of Barabanki who has introduced many innovations in potato farming.Farmers are getting Rs 3-4 per kg in the wholesale market for potato that is being sold at Rs 8-10 in the market. The cost of production alone has been around Rs 4 per kg and thus farmers are running into losses, said Verma.Kannauj, Barabanki, Farukkhabad, Firozabad and Agra are some big potato producing areas in UP.The scenario is same in other potato producing states, including West Bengal, Gujarat and Bihar, where potato has been priced almost at the same rate in the wholesale markets.The reason for low prices is very good yield this season. Last year, the potato market was really good. Farmers sold their yield for Rs 8-10 in the wholesale markets. This is what led to more farming of the crop this season. But that has brought us losses, lamented Ram Gopal, a farmer from Firozabad.Farmers said there isnt any provision for food processing in the state. We need some chips factories where our harvest can be utilised. Else it will all go waste, said Surendra Kumar, a farmer from Sultanpur.Farmers are queuing up at cold storages to get their potatoes stored. They are apprehensive that rising temperatures would lead to a lot of potato wastage.According to farmers, there are over 700 cold storages in UP. But as production has been good this time, these storages are likely to be full to capacity and farmers would have to sell off their produce at low prices.Farmers who manage to get their potatoes stored will be safe. But others are sure to incur huge losses. About 30% of the produce is likely to get either spoiled or farmers will be forced to sell it off for Rs 1-2 per kg, said Verma.Read more: Prepare roadmap to prevent farmer suicides, SC tells government"

231,231,Vegetable prices fall by up to 90%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/vegetable-prices-fall-by-up-to-90/article19052003.ece,2017-06-15,The Hindu,"Forty-six-year-old Ramesh Pahuja, a commission agent dealing in potatoes and tomatoes at the Khandsa Subzi Mandi, is worried about his dwindling profit margins due to the sharp decline in prices of vegetables this season.Claiming that the slump in the vegetables market started nearly six months ago when the government announced its demonetisation decision, Mr. Pahuja said that the prices of tomatoes had come down drastically from Rs. 50-55 per kg in June last year to just Rs. 5-6 per kg this season.High supply, low demandWith the drop in prices, our profit margins have nose-dived, it is becoming difficult for us to pay our rent or pay salaries to the workers, said Mr. Pahuja, proprietor of Satguru Trading Company.Involved in the business for over two decades, Mr. Pahuja attributed the sharp fall in prices to the bumper crop, due to good monsoon last year, and the ban on export of vegetables to Pakistan.The arrival of tomatoes in Khandsa has doubled from five tonnes last year to 10 tonnes this year, but the demand is constant and is leading to a sharp fall in prices. Besides, the vegetables are not being exported across the border. The export was allowed for three days this season and prices had suddenly gone up, but it was then closed, said Mr. Pahuja.Devidas, another commission agent, said that the prices of potatoes, onions and lemons had also fallen sharply compared to last year.Potatoes were being sold at Rs. 20 per kg in December last year, but now their prices have nose-dived to Rs. 5-6 per kg. Similarly, onions are now selling for Rs. 7-8 per kg compared to Rs. 10-12 last year. Lemon is selling at Rs. 15 per kg whereas it was Rs. 35-40 per kg last year. The sales have also decreased to half, further taking a toll on our profit margins, said Devidas, proprietor of Sahil Fruits and Vegetables Company.The commission agents, however, said that the farmers had suffered the brunt of the situation.The farmer gets around Rs. 4 per kg for tomatoes. He not able to even recover his cost. The farmers in Jharkhand a few months ago dumped tonnes of tomatoes on the roads after the price fell to just 50 paisa per kg. Same thing happened in Chhattisgarh, said Mr. Pahuja.Food for thoughtVegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are now grown in every part of the country so the supply has increased. But it is not financially viable for the government to buy them at higher rate and sell at lower rate in the market. When the prices increase there is hue and cry and the governments are forced to act. Governments fall over rise in prices. But no one cares when the farmer suffers due to fall in prices, said Tara Chand, one of the largest wholesale dealers in the mandi.Governments fall over rise in prices, but no one cares when the farmer suffers due to fall in pricesTara ChandVegetable dealer"

350,350,Value destruction: UP farmers gift potatoes to cold stores,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/value-destruction-uttar-pradesh-farmers-gift-potatoes-to-cold-stores-4918275/,2017-11-02,Indian Express,"Farm labourers planting potatoes at a field near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. (Express Photo: Harish Damodaran) Farm labourers planting potatoes at a field near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. (Express Photo: Harish Damodaran)Pradeep Chaudhary alias Guddu has seen the potato trade going through periods of mandi (slack). But never has this 47-year-old witnessed bekadri (value destruction)  the term he uses to describe the situation in the last one year, since the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise all Rs 500 and 1,000 denomination currency notes.For about a month before notebandi happened on November 8, potato was selling at Rs 500-700 per bag of 50 kg (or Rs 10-14/kg). By the month-end, prices had crashed to Rs 300-350 and further to Rs 175-225 during February-March, when the new crop was being harvested. And strangely, they havent recovered from those levels, even as the season is over and planting of the next crop is almost complete, says Guddu, owner of Om Sheet Grah Pvt Ltd, a cold storage unit at Sadabad town in Uttar Pradeshs Hathras districtFarmers in these parts  the stretch from Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura, Agra, Firozabad, Etawah, Mainpuri, Kannauj and Farrukhabad in southwest UP accounts for roughly a fifth of Indias total potato production  plant the tuber during mid-October and early November. Only 15-20 per cent of this crop is sold at the time of its harvesting towards February-March. Farmers keep the remaining 80-85 per cent in cold stores  where the potatoes are maintained at 4-5 degrees Celsius  and make staggered sales through the summer and monsoon months.This time round, probably 99 per cent of the potatoes were put into cold storage, given the low prices and lack of buyers during harvest time. Farmers thought they would realise better rates later in the season, notes Guddu. But it hasnt worked that way. Currently, the normal large (mota) potatoes are being sold from cold stores at Rs 200-225 per bag (Rs 4-4.5/kg). The medium gulla tubers are fetching just Rs 90-100 a bag (Rs 1.80-2/kg), while being even lower, at Rs 50-60 a bag (Rs 1/kg), for small kirri potatoes.But the farmer isnt the only loser. Guddus cold store can stock up to three lakh bags of potatoes. 90 per cent of this would normally have been disposed of by end-October, with the air-conditioning, too, shut with the winter arriving in the second half of November. This would allow for maintenance over the next two months and enable storing of the new crop from February.The current year, though, has been different. On October 31  when the season technically ends and cold stores cannot run without obtaining renewal licences from the state horticulture department  Guddus unit was saddled with unsold stocks of 80,000-odd bags. Most cold stores have anywhere between 25 to 35 per cent of last seasons potatoes that farmers have kept and are not re-claiming, adds Guddu.Old potatoes being dumped outside a cold store unit at Sadabad in Uttar Pradesh. (Express photo: Harish Damodaran) Old potatoes being dumped outside a cold store unit at Sadabad in Uttar Pradesh. (Express photo: Harish Damodaran)The reason for farmers not taking back their stored potatoes is simple. Cold stores charge around Rs 110 for every bag, whether it is kept for one month or eight months. Besides, they finance farmers to cover their cost of harvesting, grading and bagging (Rs 45-50), loading (Rs 3) and transport from the field to the store (Rs 20). In many cases, the credit  usually at 1.5 per cent interest per month  extends even to the bardana or jute bags costing Rs 22-23 each.If the borrowed money with interest is also included, we have to pay Rs 200 or more on every bag to the store owner. If the price we are getting does not cover even that, why take back the bag at all? asks Puran Singh. This 60-bigha (12-acre) farmer from Tambka village in Mathura districts Mahavan tehsil still has 700 out of his 2,000 bags harvested during March lying at Susheela Cold Storage in Agra. Even on the remaining 1,300 bags, the money realised from sales, at Rs 125 to Rs 225/bag, has gone entirely to pay the store owner, leaving him with nothing.The cold stores will eventually recover their Rs 110 charge and also much of what they have lent to farmers with interest. For the farmer, a price of Rs 200 per bag (Rs 4/kg) may pay his liabilities to the cold store, but will not even cover cultivation costs, contends Chaudhary Pushpendra Singh, president of Kisan Shakti Sangh, a farmer advocacy organisation.He reckons the total cost of cultivating potatoes at over Rs 10,000 a bigha, which, at an average 40 bags/bigha yield, translates into Rs 5 per kg. If to this, another Rs 4 is added towards harvesting, bagging, transport and cold storage costs, the farmer will just about start making money at a price of Rs 9/kg. The breakeven goes up further by Rs 2/kg if land is leased at the existing rates of Rs 4,000 per bigha. For potato cultivation to be profitable, the farmer has to get about Rs 15/kg. Right now, he cannot afford to even buy new seed potatoes. Most farmers this season have used their last years stored crop as seed, points out Singh.But why are prices continuing to rule low even now, when cash has supposedly returned with the Reserve Bank of India printing new notes? This is a business that always operated on cash. While the notes may be back, you are still not allowed to make daily withdrawals or deposits of more than Rs two lakh. These restrictions, plus the fear of being tracked by the income tax department, have made traders wary of buying and stocking up produce, explains Guddu.The effects of it are being felt in places such as Hathras. This district alone has about 150 operational cold stores, handling an average of two lakh bags each. At last years average realisation of Rs 400 per bag (Rs 8/kg) for all varieties  including gulla and kirri  the value of this entire produce would have been Rs 1,200 crore. But at Rs 150 per bag (Rs 3/kg), the same 3 crore bags from a single district would be worth Rs 450 crore.If this calculation is extended to other potato-belt districts, you can imagine how much value destruction has taken place in the last one year. And the loser is not just the farmer, but also those who sell and provide services to him, observes Pushpendra Singh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
