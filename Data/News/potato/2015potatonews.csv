0,No Proof Required: Tipping point 2015,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/no-proof-required-tipping-point-2015/,2015-01-02,Indian Express,"Economists have already started talking, and analysing, developments in the post-crisis period, where the crisis in question is the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-2009.You like potato and I like potahto/ You like tomato and I like tomahto  Gershwins, 1937, Lets Call the Whole Thing OffThe last few years have been difficult for any and all forecasters, so I approach the prognosis for the future with a considerable degree of trepidation. But try one must, and my forecast is made easier by the fact that my DNA is ++.If one peruses historical literature on growth, inflation, and much else, analysts always note, and separate, developments in the post-war period from what happened in the pre-war period. The war in question is World War II. Economists have already started talking, and analysing, developments in the post-crisis period, where the crisis in question is the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-2009. The recovery period of 2010 is often ignored in discussions about the post-crisis period, a convention I agree with and follow.The reason for a distinct, if not separate, view of the world post-crisis is because the crisis was a tipping point in the world economy as we knew it. And like all tipping points, it wasnt as if the world changed overnight. The change process has been in operation at least since 1980, when China began to reform, and since 1991, when India began to reform and the internet invaded our lives. What mattered for the global economy were global developments, and not individual country policies. With a large increase in the global supply of workers, inflation in particular ceased to be purely a domestic policy concern. That does not mean that individual country polices did not matter; rather that they began to matter less and less.The median inflation rate in the developed world has averaged 2.0 per cent over the last four years (2011-2014), with both 2013 and 2014 registering the lowest rates, around 1.3 per cent! For developing economies, the average median inflation rate has averaged 4.4 per cent, and with the last two years averaging the lowest, at around 3.8 per cent each year.The only manner in which an economy could guide its own misfortune was for it to remain closed to international developments, and prices. (This India did with regard to food prices, and paid a heavy price with inflation averaging close to 10 per cent in 2011-2013.)In terms of growth, the world economy has been on a downer for these four years. Except for a large island continent called the United States, the developed world has averaged less than 1 per cent growth per annum for the last four years. The developing world has been averaging a GDP growth of only 5.4 per cent per annum.Simply, that it is time now for all monetarists and fiscal hawks to call it a day. I have long felt that it is the easiest thing in the world to be a monetarist and/ or a fiscal hawk. How can you go wrong with an identity  money supply growth just has to equal the money value of output.And since world output has been growing at the slowest pace, well then, all that money supply growth had to have led to higher inflation.More QEs (of the quantitative easing variety) have sailed in the last three years than through all the ages. They have had a British colour as befits an island that gave us the Titanic; they have come from the ultra-conservative, and ultra-monetarist shores, of the erstwhile Weimar Republic; they have sailed from the island that attacked Pearl Harbour; and from the continent that solidified the doctrine of monetarism in the late-1950s (and that presciently gave it up in the mid-1980s). Yet, all these ships have steamed ahead without causing a flutter in prices; indeed, the rate of inflation has steadily come down, and done so in almost every country.But the monetarist hawks have been undeterred, in the world, as in India. They are confident and proud becausethey have a non-falsifiable identity on their side. Except, a funny thing has happened, unknown to the identity hawks. It is called the velocity of money, something that makes blindly following an identity a case of the blind following the blind.The flip side of the blind monetarist is the equally blind fiscal deficit hawk. Prices have to go up, and growth has to go down, when the fiscal deficit expands. Again, the record just does not support that argument. The world went through a deficit binge in 2009 and 2010, as growth recovery was attempted. In some countries there was extra growth, but in almost all countries, there was lower inflation. Again, India was the exception because its policymakers (and many of its economists) were ostriches to the outside world.Over the last few months, oil prices have achieved a large structural break downward. Other commodity prices are following, or will follow, a downward trend. Inflation is stabilising at less than 2 per cent for the developed world, and 4 per cent for the emerging economies. The world economy is poised to get back to the 4 per cent growth range over the next two years, a considerable jump from the recent average of 3.3 per cent. This is not the consensus expectation  far from it. But differences in opinion provide for the existence of horse races. The US is expected to lead the revival for the developed world, and India for the developing world. Achhe dinare coming for the world economy starting today, January 1, 2015.The writer is chairman of Oxus Investments, an emerging market advisory firm, and a senior advisor to Zyfin, a leading financial information company.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
1,Veggie prices skyrocket with dip in temperature in Jaipur,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/Veggie-prices-skyrocket-with-dip-in-temperature-in-Jaipur/articleshow/45737438.cms,2015-01-03,The Times Of India,"JAIPUR: Snowfall in Himachal Pradesh, dense fog in Uttar Pradesh and abrupt rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh have led to sharp increase in vegetable prices across Rajasthan in the past three days. The record dip in temperature in the state also damaged standing crops, reducing the inflow of homegrown vegetables.After a long spell of low price rates and good production of vegetables in state, the price index are fast rising. Cold waves and fogs have restricted the movement of trucks affecting the prices in Jaipur. Supply from HP and UP have been hit badly due to the weather conditions. Similarly, supplies from Haryana, Punjab and Uttrakhand have also fallen.""Against the normal arrival of 10-15 trucks daily, only 3-5 trucks are reaching to Jaipur with delay of three days. So far, the demand is being met from supplies from Chomu and around Jaipur. But with decrease in temperature, their production will be adversely affected and will further trigger an upward trend,"" said Ashok Agarwal, a vegetable trader in Mohana Mandi.According to Agarwal, compared to previous years, vegetable production has been low in the state and said any minor change in weather may lead to huge gap in demand and supply. ""Farmers told me that not much crops were harvested this season. There has been some increase in prices but customers have to remain be very cautious in the coming days,"" said Radheyshyam Phatak, president of the Rajasthan Fruits and Vegetable Traders Association.He added that green vegetables which used to be available in abundance during winters are now in short supply. ""In no winter, I have seen fenugreek (methi) selling at Rs 22 per kg in wholesale. Mustard green (Sarasan ka Saag) has reached Rs 30 per kg. It is largely because they are just not coming to the market from farms"".The rising demand from Pakistan for Indian tomatoes has also led to a price hike. ""20 trucks of tomatoes daily are going from Bangalore and Delhi towards Pakistan instead of coming to Rajasthan. Prices have risen by 10% to Rs 20 a kg in the past 10-15 days,"" said Yogesh Singh, a trader of tomatoes and potatoes at Mohana Mandi.VegetableWholesaleRetailSpinach 14-1835-40Peppermint leaves20-2230-35Peas25-3050-55Radish 3.50/piece5/pieceLemon35-3855-60Cabbage15-1830-35Onion20-2535-40"
2,"Winter rain, a boon for farmers",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150105/jsp/jharkhand/story_6703.jsp,2015-01-05,Telegraph,"The recent downpour has cushioned irrigation woes Ranchi, Jan. 4: The shiver, the slush on roads and frequent power cuts notwithstanding, scientists at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU), Kanke, are of the opinion that the recent showers are a blessing. ""Showers that lashed the state for the last two days are a boon for all types of standing rabi crops like wheat, mustard, peas, barley and gram. These are sown in late November or early December and at present are in the vegetative or pre-flowering stage. Watering at this time is good. The intermittent rain helps the soil absorb moisture,"" said BAU's chief scientist D.N. Singh. Explaining the advantages, Singh said that as a result of the sudden showers, the soil would retain sufficient moisture for the next 15 to 20 days. ""The downpour has taken care of the farmers' worries regarding irrigation and related costs,"" Singh added. Besides, the rain has also pulled down temperatures and reduced the rate of evaporation. A lower rate of evaporation will help retain the present level of ground water. But all is not well. The showers have also brought fresh problems for the farmers. ""Since the soil is moist, weeds will grow fast. Farmers will have to take extra effort to remove the weeds and top their fields with urea to increase production,"" said the BAU chief scientist. A.Wadood, chairman of the department of agricultural physics at BAU, echoed him. ""The showers have helped add sufficient moisture to the soil, thereby relieving farmers of incurring additional cost of irrigation. But, a sharp fall in temperatures brings with it the dangers of pests and various farm diseases,"" he said. Original Recent rains both a blessing and a curse, say farm scientists RUDRA BISWAS Ranchi, Jan.04: The shiver, the slush on the roads and frequent power cuts caused by trees tumbling on overhead transmission wires notwithstanding, agriculture scientists at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU), Ranchi, today stressed that the recent rains are both a blessing and a curse. The past two days ofrains are a blessing for all types of standing rabi crops "" wheat, vegetables, lentils, mustard, potato, peas, barley, gram, linseed etc. These crops were sown in late November or early December and at present are in the vegetative or pre-flowering stage. Watering at this point of time is very good for them as the intermittent rains help the soils to absorb a lot of moistre,? D.N.Singh, chief scientist, BAU told The Telegraph. Though the rains disrupted normal life, they have made farmers happy. The rains have ended their worries about irrigation and the attendant additional costs. As a result of therains, the soils would retain sufficient moisture for the next 15 to 20 days. The rains have drastically reduced the cost of cultivation as no irrigation would now be needed and farmers would no longer have to run their diesel pump sets to water their fields, at least for the next three weeks. There is considerable savings at the farmers end, Singh explained. ""For the standing wheat crop,in particular, which needs a lot of water at this time, the rains have been a real blessing. Besides the rains and subsequent drop in temperatures have also helpedreduce the rate of evaporation. Prior to the rains, there were reports from all over that wells and ponds have already begun to dry up. A lower rate of evaporation will help to retain the present levels of ground water,"" he added. The advantages apart, the recent rains bring problems as well for farmers. Since the soils are moist, weeds would grow fast. Farmers would have to take care to remove the weeds as quickly as possible and top their fields with urea to increase production and productivity,? the BAU chief scientist(rice) said. A.Wadood, chairman, department of agricultural physics, BAU,Ranchi,too stressed that the past two days of rains have benefitted all types of standing rabi crops. The rains have helped to add sufficient moistre in the soils thereby relieving farmers of incurring additional cost on irrigating their fields, At the same time they have caused a lot of discomfort to us,? Wadood told The Telegraph. However, farmers would need to take extra caution to protect the crops from pest attacks and diseases. A sharp fall in temperatures brings with it dangers of protecting the standing crops from pests and various farm diseases. Through different channels we have begun to advise farmers throughout the state to spray pesticides in their fields to protect their standing crops from pest attacks and diseases, Wadood warned. Particularly vulnerable is the potato crop due to sudden drop in temperatures. A disease called  blight caused in moist conditions and under falling temperatures, can destroy an entire crop field overnight, he added. In case temperatures drop below 5 degree Celsius, farmers would do well to resort to natural fumigation by burning waste products like dried grass, leaves and twigs in their fields to ward off pests and farm diseases,? he stressed.

3,Unchecked export to Pakistan leaves vegetables in Delhi pricy,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/unchecked-export-to-pakistan-leaves-vegetables-in-delhi-pricy/article6762097.ece,2015-01-07,The Hindu,"According to Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee member Mahinder Kumar, unregulated export of vegetables to Pakistan has led to prices here shooting up by nearly 50 per cent. File Photo: V.V. KrishnanPrices of vegetables in the city seem to have escalated with each passing day last week and the increase can be attributed to unbridled export of vegetables to Pakistan.Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee member Mahinder Kumar said unregulated export of vegetables to Pakistan has led to prices here shooting up by nearly 50 per cent.Wholesale prices were stable last month. However, over the past week, prices have gone up as key vegetables like tomatoes are being exported to Pakistan, he said.What happened this time around was that rains were untimely and the harvest was not much. Despite the produce not being enough, export to Pakistan continues unabated. Truckloads of vegetables like potatoes, peas and tomatoes continue to be exported, resulting in escalation of cost here.The government, Mr. Kumar said, has failed to frame a policy to ensure that vegetables are exported only when there is sufficient stock in the city. At least 100 trucks of vegetables are being sent to Pakistan daily. One truck can carry 20 tonnes of a particular vegetable.The Delhi Government, on the other hand, has claimed that prices of onions, potatoes, tomatoes and other vegetables are 10 per cent to 30 per cent less than last year. It also claimed that prices of many vegetables have shown a decline in the past three months, with supply of key vegetables being much higher in December 2014 compared to that in December 2013.Meanwhile, tomatoes, which used to cost Rs.5 per kg in the wholesale market, are currently being sold for Rs.25 per kg. Peas, which were available in the wholesale markets across Delhi for Rs.10 per kg, are being sold for nearly Rs.30 per kg. Similarly, prices of capsicum have gone up to Rs.70 per kg from Rs.45 per kg a week ago.Traders at Azadpur mandi added that the wholesale price of potatoes has increased to Rs.20 per kg from Rs.10-Rs.15 per kg a week ago. However, the price of onions is more or less stable at Rs.15-Rs.20 per kg.Traders say that cauliflower, which is generally available for Rs.10 per kg, is currently selling for Rs.80 per kg. However, this is due to farmers opting not to grow cauliflower considering less returns last year.The bad news, they say, is that prices are going to increase further and there is no respite in sight."
4,Veggie prices fall as field beans flood markets,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/452405/veggie-prices-fall-field-beans.html,2015-01-08,Deccan Herald,"Veggie prices fall as field beans flood marketsBengaluru, Jan 08, 2015, DHNS: 0:38 ISTBuyers have a field dayVegetable prices have headed downwards in the last couple of days, much to the relief of consumers.The icing on the cake, though, is the fact that the prices will remain affordable till at least the end of this month. The entry of field beans (avarekai) into the market and their sale in huge quantities has lessened the demand for other vegetables, thus reducing their prices, say traders.Prices of most vegetables, barring the peas, are presently between Rs 10 and Rs 30 a kg at wholesale markets, the traders said.Speaking to Deccan Herald, R V Gopi, president of the Vegetable and Fruit Wholesale Merchants Association, said, Among the vegetables, the prices of beans have decreased the most from Rs 35Rs 40 a kg last week to Rs 15-Rs 20 this week.Tomatoes and potatoes are being sold at wholesale vegetable markets at prices between Rs 10 and Rs 20 per kg. There is a reduction in the vegetable prices by 40 per cent.He said that at least till Makara Sankranti that falls on January 15 this year, the demand for field beans will be higher than that for other vegetables.Traders in Kalasipalyam said that the market had been receiving more than 200 tonnes of field beans every day since January first week. Sources in Hopcoms pointed out that compared to the corresponding month last year, the prices of field beans are much cheaper this time.The production of field beans is high, making them available at cheaper rates. However, farmers growing other vegetables are facing losses, an official from Hopcoms said.Meanwhile, the prices of basic kitchen ingredients such as ginger and garlic remain unchanged and are being sold at Rs 70 to Rs 100 per kg respectively.The prices of green chillies have come down from Rs 75 per kg to Rs 60. The prices of coriander leaves have reduced by 20 per cent, said Shankar Gowda, a wholesale vegetable trader from Girinagar."

But now, they can get their soil tested by showing their card at the centre and choose the fertiliser,"" he added.On a pilot basis, the government will purchase potatoes and onions from the market when their prices drop. When the prices increase, the government will sell them to people at low rates. This way, middlemen will be eliminated, the minister said.Union Fertilisers Minister Ananth Kumar, who was also present on the occasion, said the Central government was planning to set up six urea fertiliser production units in the country out of which one would be in the State.""The plant would be set up on a 500-acre land. While the central government will set up the unit, the State government will provide the land. There are 30 urea plants existing in the country already.""He said, there will be a discount of Rs 29 on purchase of one bag of neem-coated urea.Pay compensationUnseasonal rainfall and drought had led to crop loss and financial losses to the farmers, said Horticulture and Agriculture Marketing minister Shamanur Shivashanaka--rappa.He was speaking at the inauguration of a three-day inter-state horticulture fair Sangam- 2015 on Friday.The Union government is yet to pay Karnataka farmers Rs 800 crore as compensation.

Traders attribute it to increase in supply and farmers say that the output has gone up because of favorable weather conditions.Earlier this week, prices of tomato and certain green vegetables had shot up because of unseasonal rains. Prices of vegetables including spinach, fenugreek, cucumber, tomato and many other seasonal vegetables have now come down by about 20%. While tomato prices have come down from Rs 30 per kg to Rs 20 per kg, onion and potato prices have also come down marginally in the past two to three days.""The supply has increased and prices have come down even though demand continues to be high due to marriage season,"" wholesale trader Vinod Kumar told Hindustan Times.""Harvesting of vegetables like spinach and fenugreek (methi) is in full swing and so there has been a steep fall in the prices of green leafy vegetables. This will put pressure on prices of other vegetables,"" Kumar said.Agriculture experts have now stressed upon increase in government expenditure on improving the infrastructure to raise the farm output and also take steps to enhance the storage and handling capacity. The key reform, say experts, is changing the dynamics of handling (transportation) and storage and also parameters of vegetable production to increase production capacity.""Shrinkage in area under vegetable cultivation has also become a matter of concern as villages near the urban areas are giving way to townships,"" said agriculture expert Samar Singh.The onus, say experts, is on the government to make agriculture more profitable for farmers to stop selling the fertile land."
7,Storages eye higher capacity,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150114/jsp/business/story_8275.jsp,2015-01-14,Telegraph,"Ramapada Paul in Calcutta on Tuesday. Picture byKishor Roy Chowdhury Calcutta, Jan. 13: Cold storage units in Bengal are hoping for better capacity utilisation with potato production in the state likely to go up to 110 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. Potato is the major produce which is kept in cold storage units across Bengal. According to the representatives of the West Bengal Cold Storage Association (WBCSA), the 435 storages in the state would load potato from March and release them from May. ""The crop coverage area has gone up 10 per cent to 4.5 lakh hectares over last year. Based on the coverage area, we are expecting production of 110 lakh tonnes in 2014-15,"" said Ramapada Paul, president of the WBCSA. Patit Paban De, a member of the association, said that the combined capacity of the cold storage units in the state was around 62 lakh tonnes per annum, which is adequate after factoring in direct consumption. ""The capacity utilisation levels over the last two years have increased to 90 per cent. With an improved area under cultivation, we are expecting the utilisation levels to further improve,"" said De. He added that capacity would also increase around 3 per cent in the fiscal year 2014-15. WBCSA members, however, said that the state government needs to consider another revision in rentals because of the rising operating costs. The state government had last hiked the rents by Rs 19 per quintal in 2013. De also said that a large part of the total potato production in the state was being supplied to neighbouring states - such as Odisha, Jharkhand, North East and even in the south to Andhra Pradesh and some parts of Tamil Nadu - and the state is earning a significant revenue through such sale. Asked about the potato price movement, WBCSA officials said the price was unlikely to come below Rs 10-12 per kg at retail level. The association will celebrate its golden jubilee on 19th and 20th January."

Prices of major food articles like wheat, potatoes, onions, egg, fish and meat fell drastically.According to the WPI data, wheat prices decelerated by 2.46 percent from a rise of 7.64 percent year-on-year. Potatoes prices came down from an increase of 56.78 percent in December 2013, to a negative 4.78 percent.Onions prices contracted by 18.54 percent from an increase of 38.30 percent year-on-year. Egg, fish and meat inflation stood at 0.68 percent from a rise of 11.68 percent in December, 2013.Fuel and power inflation declined to 7.82 percent from an appreciation of 10.87 percent during December, 2013.The wholesale decline comes on the back of retail inflation falling to a low of five percent in December from 9.87 percent during the corresponding month of 2013.The December retail inflation was, however, a rise over the record low of 4.4 percent CPI registered in November 2014.The retail inflation rate recorded in November was the lowest since India started computing consumer price index (CPI) in January 2012. December's retail inflation increase came after fourth straight month of decline till November.The current WPI and CPI data will boost India Inc.'s hope for a rate cut from the apex bank in its next monetary policy announcement. The RBI has set a target for CPI inflation at 8 percent by January 2015 and 6 percent by January 2016.It has retained the economy's growth projection for current fiscal at 5.5 percent and said the future policy stance will be influenced by the inflation outlook."

12,JMM dharna,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150123/jsp/jharkhand/story_9706.jsp,2015-01-23,Telegraph,"Former chief minister Hemant Soren at the dharna near Raj Bhavan in Ranchi on Thursday. (Hardeep Singh ) Ranchi, Jan. 22: The JMM has taken to the streets to corner the Raghubar Das government on a wide range of issues starting from the much-debated local residents' policy to the central government bid to change the land acquisition law through an ordinance. Party members, led by vice-president Hemant Soren, staged a dharna in front of Raj Bhavan, voicing fears that the BJP will also dilute the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) Act and Santhal Pargana Tenancy (SPT) Act that safeguard tribals' land rights. Former chief minister Hemant said that tribals and original natives of Jharkhand had already been marginalised and now, their identity would be completely lost once the amended land acquisition law fully came into force. ""Jharkhand has always been identified with the CNT and SPT Acts. But Jharkhandis will be deprived of even Grade III and IV jobs if the polices of the new government are implemented. We cannot afford to sit idle,"" he added. Hemant claimed that the BJP ruled in Jharkhand for nearly 10 years since the state was carved out from Bihar in November 2000. But no development took place and the BJP grabbed power again by misleading the masses. The youths, in particular, have been the worse victims of the BJP's policies, he added. ""The BJP is boasting that the prices of diesel and petrol have gone down. But how has that benefited the poor? Have the prices of onions and potatoes and such other essential commodities gone down as well?"" Hemant questioned. This was the JMM's maiden public campaign after formation of the Raghubar Das government on December 28. The party has announced to gradually expand the campaign across the state and steer the battle to decisive ends."
13,‘Udyan Fresh is a great concept’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150124/jsp/odisha/story_9897.jsp,2015-01-24,Telegraph,"The basic purpose behind the launch of the National Horticulture Mission programme in 2005-06 was the growth of horticulture. It has failed. What is your take? Thats not correct. Horticulture has become a subsidy-driven scheme these days. Thousands of people coming out of the technical institutions remain unemployed. If these people take up horticulture as a mission, the scenario would certainly be different. Subsidies are also available these days. However, it has been noticed that only big corporate players are coming forward. If the smaller ones including entrepreneurs take up horticulture across the state, the situation would certainly improve. I want to mention that the state has a number of agro-climatic zones, vast lands and other facilities where horticulture has immense potential. To encourage the sector apart from subsidies, plans are under way to provide financial assistance through Capital Venture Fund (likely to be set up). How will the fund help? Suppose one is interested to set up a cold storage, he will get a 50 per cent subsidy. However, he still requires funds to set up the cold storage. If we are able to provide them with a soft term loan through the Capital Venture Fund, the entrepreneur will not run after banks to get a loan. Through this intervention, we can motivate them and solve their financial requirements to a great extent.What is the status of horticulture in the state at this moment? Horticulture is being taken up on around 36 lakh hectares of land. Our target is to increase the coverage area by another 20 lakh hectares. The produce from the high and medium paddy land is decreasing. If we convert the upland for horticulture purposes, it would be beneficial for the farmers. We are now providing both forward and backward linkages to the farmers. Market linkages are also being offered to them.Potato is a common food item for every household of the state. But every year, we have to depend on Bengal to meet the requirements. How long will this trend continue? The state is facing the potato crisis because of two reasons  lack of cold storage facilities and non-availability of quality planting materials at the time of cultivation. Our job is to increase quality seed production and provide them to the farmers, increase potato crop coverage areas, and set the farmers a minimum support price for their produce.How will you do it? The government has launched a Potato Mission. We have set a target to make our state self-sufficient in potato production. The government is floating an expression of interest to set up cold storages in the private sectors. Under the mission, the state aims to increase potato cultivation on 60,000 hectares to achieve the targeted production of 11.25 lakh tonne by 2017-18. Currently, potato is grown on around 15,000 hectares of land in the state with an annual production of 2.5 lakh tonne. The potato productivity of the state is only 16.48 tonne per hectare against the national average of 22.8 tonne per hectare. We will also increase potato seed production to 1.20 lakh tonne. A team of officials had visited Lima in Peru last year to gain firsthand knowledge on potato production. Did the visit yield any result? We have gained a lot from their experience. They had visited the International Potato Centre headquarters. Their officials have also visited our state. They will set up a research centre in Odisha to help the transfer of knowledge. They will also help us in developing a variety of potato seeds, which can be cultivated after the paddy harvest is over. Onion is another item for which the state has to depend on import. What are the steps you are taking to boost its cultivation? The state government has signed an agreement with the Nasik-based National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation to boost up the onion production. We have handed over 50.92 acres of land in Boudh districts Palijhar Agriculture Farm to the foundation to carry out various research programmes. They will also help in establishing the zero-energy cold storage facilities where the onion produce can be stored for eight months without much expense. Besides, the foundation will also establish a training and production centre to provide modern technical knowledge on horticulture. The centre will produce onion seeds, onion cloves and garlic seeds. The produce will be provided to the farmers across the state at cheaper prices.In the form of Udyan Fresh, your department has intervened the market to control the rising price of vegetables and provide the urban people with fresh fruits. But, it does not appear to be a successful project Its an outstanding concept to provide fresh fruits to the people of Bhubaneswar. It also aims to fix a remunerative price for the farmers. But the subsidy is very low if we compare the total amount that has been invested in Udyan Fresh. The initiative will need time to mature in the governance. The backward linkage has to be made stronger. The people involved there are on a mission and their future is bright. One can notice that even for exotic flowers we have to depend on other states and cities such as Bangalore. When will this situation improve? Odisha has one of the best climates for orchid plantation. Private entrepreneurs have taken up such cultivation in Huma. We have also started encouraging them. Besides orchids, there are many other flowers like roses that can also be cultivated. Now, as the locals have started producing roses, flowers from Bangalore are facing a tough competition here. In fact, the import has reduced to some extent. However, we have to increase the scale of production. It is certainly going to happen in the coming days.Any plan to increase the production of the Kandhamal turmeric? We are going to give a boost to the organic farming of Kandhamal turmeric.The mango festival, organised by your directorate, has been a success every year. How do you plan to export more varieties of mango? Our farmers are becoming conscious about the market rates. Dashehari, a mango variety found in our state, reaches the Delhi markets before mangoes from other states do. It is also superior in quality as compared to other varieties of mango. Another advantage is that our mangoes get ready to be picked quite early, by the end of April. The challenge is to eliminate the middlemen and brokers from the system. A mango hub is coming up in Dhenkanal, which has emerged as a major mango producing area with an annual production of over 1.25 lakh tonnes. The local farmers are growing Amrapali, Langra, Dashehari, Himsagar and Mallika varieties on a commercial scale.There have been allegations of corruption in your department. Vigilance officials have arrested some employees for manipulating the figures and showing plantation in different areas. There was a mismatch between the plantations undertaken and the number of seedlings actually planted. How do you check it? We are going to launch a global positioning system-based geographic information monitoring system. The picture of any intervention on any plot can be downloaded from the Internet. Anyone can do it and check the records with that of the actual number of plantations there. With this, we hope to check the corruption to a great extent. The state government has zero tolerance for any sort of corruption. The departmental inquiry has already been initiated for all these cases. Once the officials submit the charge sheets, we will take necessary disciplinary measures as per the provision of law and even dismiss them if need be.

14,Naik urges farmers to revert to traditional organic farming,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/Naik-urges-farmers-to-revert-to-traditional-organic-farming/articleshow/45999898.cms,2015-01-24,The Times Of India,"NASHIK: Union minister of state for health and family welfare Shripad Naik on Friday urged farmers to revert to traditional organic farming to avoid disadvantages arising out of chemical fertilisers.Addressing farmers at the inauguration of an agricultural exhibition, organised by Shree Swami Samarth Agricultural Development and Research Charitable Trust, Naik said, ""Earlier, farming was done traditionally, but we have forgotten this and adopted chemical fertilisers to increase productivity and earn money. But we have only invited diseases due to this kind of farming. There is a need to strengthen the knowledge of our traditional farming and focus on organic farming to create a healthy society.""Naik urged farmers to focus on growing medicinal plants as ""the legacy"" of the country.The four-day agricultural exhibition got underway from Friday. Around 300 stalls have been put up at the exhibition at the Dongre Hostel grounds, along Gangapur Road in Nashik. Various agri implements like solar pumps, farm pumps, drip irrigation mechanisms, potato harvest machines and other new technology pertaining to agriculture have been put on display.Agricultural and revenue minister of state Eknath Khadse said that the state government has adopted a policy of promoting organic farming in Maharashtra to overcome the disadvantages of chemical fertilisers. ""Funds will be provided to farmers if they engage in organic farming. We are planning to promote organic farming through groups,"" Khadse said.""Farmers will not commit suicide and they do not need government grants if the government makes efforts to offer them better prices for agricultural produce, relaxes export restrictions on certain commodities and promotes the export of commodities,"" said Annasaheb More of Shree Swami Samarth Agricultural Development and Research Charitable Trust.""Today, all major rivers in the country are polluted, as effluents and others things are flowing into these. This polluted water, used for farming, causes diseases. We need to focus on making our rivers pollution free and provide pure water,"" More said."
15,State government to take up central government assisted agriculture scheme,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/State-government-to-take-up-central-government-assisted-agriculture-scheme/articleshow/46033206.cms,2015-01-27,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: The state government has passed the centre government assisted agriculture scheme - 'Amar Dhan Amar Chatal' in which sheds will be set up and paddy drying machines will be provided to farmers across the state to protect the procured paddy from getting damaged before it is sent to the rice mills.The scheme which is under the central government entails farmers to protect paddy by bringing it under a shed and the drying machines will be supplied to farmers to produce rice in the mills. ""It is more of a post harvesting care for ensuring food security. The scheme will fall under the second green revolution in eastern India,"" said a senior agriculture department official.Officials said that it was yet to be fully finalized as to how many farmers will be brought under the scheme in the first phase. ""Farmers from all districts across the state will come under the purview of the scheme. The drying machines that will be brought from Germany costs around Rs 10,000 each"" an official said.Earlier, the state government slashed the levy imposed on the rice mills for procuring rice from the government from 50% to 25%, with the food and supplies department keeping its procurement target of 22 lakh metric tonne intact for the next procurement season. Food camps will be held in 165 blocks across the state for selling rice to the farmers. The state government will also give 15 paisa of subsidy for procuring per kilogram of rice.Besides, agriculture department officials have started working on distributing leaflets to farmers to make them aware on how potato plants could be protected from various kinds of diseases."
16,Budget 2015: Swap higher outlays for efficient spending,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/opinion-india/budget-2015-swap-higher-outlays-for-efficient-spending/,2015-01-28,The Times Of India,"A cold Republic Day had FM Jaitley looking dapper under his stylish cap as he snuggled into his overcoat on a rain lashed Rajpath munched nuts and broodingly watched the parade go past.PM Modis off-swingWas he fleshing out what he would say in his budget speech to the Indian Parliament just one month away? Should he bowl a leg-spin veering sharply left towards equity or an off-swing veering right and towards growth? Around him, on its 66 Republic Day, Modi India was visibly exhilarated celebrating its off-swing to the right.China, possibly stung by this sudden change of events, after the cozy, bon homie of the recent jhula swing on the banks of the Sabarmati, retorted by clasping Pakistan even tighter as an eternal friend. Meanwhile the Greek loony left, united with the loony right to aspire to become a sovereign debt defaulter with the rest of Southern Europe waiting to follow, should their anarchic tactic succeed.Sovereign debt strategyAvoiding payment by default is not a new strategy. Latin America similarly exploited the short memories of lenders with serial debt defaults. In contrast Asia, in general and India, in particular, has been very puritanical about its debt obligations, never having defaulted even once in the last forty years, though we came close to it in 1991.Whilst morally correct, it is unclear if this is a good fiscal strategy. Standard and Poors rates India sovereign debt BBB-, the same as Brazil (which defaulted thrice-1983, 1986 and 1990 in the last 40 years) and lower than Peru-BBB+ (which defaulted twice in 1980 and 1984). From this perspective, debt default is not about prestige, national honour or about financial rewards. It is merely a game of brinksmanship to be played with the market, if it serves us well.Was FM Jaitley pondering the merits of doing a Latin America; borrowing recklessly to finance a populist, public investment binge, which growth-wallahs are crying themselves hoarse demanding?Borrowing more is the soft option to reforming expenditure since tax collections have dipped. Our borrowing capacity for FY 2015-is limited by a Fiscal Deficit (FD) envelop of 3.8% of GDP, down from the target of 4.1% in the current year. Even the higher FD level severely constrained resources though this constraint remained hidden. The previous UPA-II government put so many non-fiscal barriers on investment-lengthy environmental approvals; land acquisition constraints and contractual inconsistencies which ensured that the project stream froze thereby avoiding additional cash outflows.The present government is working overtime to unclog the pipes and clear payment arrears. These have built up over time but they do not show up in the budget. Unlike Indian companies, the government follows the cash and not the accrual accounting system. Both unpaid current liabilities and uncollected current assets are not accounted for in the annual budget. This loop hole enabled the previous government to sell our future by collecting arrears whilst falsely showing a robust budget allocation.Growth and inflationIndian growth-wallahs are prepared to risk inflation if it means pushing growth to 7% from the 5.5% it is likely to record in the current year. But the trade off, at the margin, between growth, inflation and jobs is unclear. This is dangerous ground for those living on the edge.Growth is just a meaningless number for the average citizen. Jobs are welcome of course. But we do not have a jobs filter that can assess competing investment. We do not even measure changes in employment through the year. In comparison inflation is an everyday reality which the poor and the urban lower middle class have to battle with daily.If there is a choice between growth and more inflation, the FM would be well advised to choose containing inflation to below 5% even at the cost of chugging along at a 6% growth level.Public investment is highly inefficientThe real question is if the domestic and international private sector is unwilling to invest, as for example in Nuclear energy, how can it be desirable for public investment? Clearly, an unhelpful institutional context makes these investments into lemons. Unless the root causes of their unviability are addressed, such projects are neither good for the private nor the public sector.Public investment stoked growth is strongly dependent on the efficiency of public expenditure and the avoidance of pork- gold plated projects which fail to provide social returns and jobs. Excessive investment in new renewable energy (a rapidly evolving technology) has precisely this risk.No bubbles pleaseOf course the stock markets will not be enthused by such fiscal caution. But who really gains from the irrational financial exuberance (or despair) of stock markets except a few savvy speculators with deep pockets- not all of them Indian either.Real Estate is another sector which should be left to lag not lead growth. It is a safe haven for black money fed speculation. Five years of cheap money since 2009, high inflation and massive corruption are the drivers of the Indian realty bubble. We have to guard against such bubbles, which consume the savings of the middle class, as in Japan (1980 to 1990) and more recently in the US (2004 to 2012).Looking back to the futureOne stratagem to inject conservatism into the budget would be to project the FY 2015-16 budget on the growth and revenue numbers which were achieved in 2014-15.Looking backwards to define the fiscal envelop will further constrict spending estimates. But this would be a useful, albeit unorthodox mechanism, to drive better collection of tax and non-tax revenues and contain pork in the spending estimates.If there are happy surprises  revenue exceeding estimates or growth exceeding forecast levels, the surplus generated could be allocated to pre-defined schemes in a supplementary budget later in the fiscal year. Leaving something on the table is good strategy anyway to keep stakeholders engaged and responsive.Our biggest worry is that populism will trump reason. Subsidies are the elephant in the room of fiscal responsibility. Rationalizing them has become a political hot potato with potentially high political costs. This is why reform needs to be both well timed and appropriately sequenced.Limited reform windowFY 2015-16 is the only reform window available to India for the next four years. If we cant do it now we never shall. The 2016-17 budget shall be populist since Bihar (2016), UP (2017) and then Rajasthan, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh go to the polls (2018) followed by National Elections in 2019.Can we, for starters at least, legislate a cap on subsidies just as there is a medium term trend and cap on FD? We dont know enough about the extent, substance, nature and social impact of subsidies. Why not make these aspects more explicit by changing the way in which we present the budget documents?Two subsidy reform steps are immediately doable.First, making petroleum prices market determined is a no-brainer in the present scenario of cheap energy. This will plug one gap in the subsidy envelop.Second, rationalize agricultural subsidies which are provided through multiple mechanisms; assured purchase prices for cereals; cheap fertilizer; cheap power; cheap irrigation water; no tax on income and minimal tax on land. Despite these subsidies, rural wages remain low and migration to urban areas is the only options for landless workers and marginal land owners.These subsidies have only served to create a class of elite millionaire farmers; a tiny fragment at the very tip of the 600 odd million strong farming community. Why not use it to better target the poor, rural folk instead? An additional advantage would be that the rural poor have a significant overlap with Dalits and Muslims, neither of which are part of the BJPs traditional support base.Will FM Jaitley grasp the moment and push through reform or do we have to wait till 2020 for substantive change?"
17,Potato Growers Stare at More Losses as Export Ban Continues,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/potato-growers-stare-at-more-losses-as-export-ban-continues/story-sF1MvcLezDHEX1utoVuDmO.html,2015-01-29,Hindustan Times,"Giving another jolt to the potato growers in the harvesting season, prices of the vegetable plummeted to a mere Rs 400 per quintal from Rs 600 within 15 days.At the time of sowing, potato prices had increased to Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,600 per quintal resulting in farmers increasing crop acreage, but to their sheer disappointment, the prices took a downward turn as soon as the harvesting season came around the corner.As per the information, the drop in prices has been caused to the ban on export of the vegetable in order to control inflation.Earlier, government's export bans had not included Pakistan but the recent decision has included our neighbor as well, increasing the pressure on the prices. Pakistan is the largest market for Indian potatoes during the first half of this fiscal (April-October).The farmers who were already facing losses to the tune of Rs 20,000 per acre due to a fall in prices from Rs 1,600 to Rs 600 per quintal, would now have to bear losses of Rs 30,000 per acre.The situation is exacerbated by the fact that farmers were forced to buy potato seeds at high rates as at that time the price of potato was at a peak.Kuldeep Singh, a farmer said that he had paid Rs 1,700 for a 50-kg bag of potato seeds during the sowing season. He said that including expenses such as seeds, irrigation, labour, pesticides and fuel, a farmer would have spent nothing less than Rs 80,000 per acre this season.""The prices have now dropped to just Rs 400 per quintal. If a farmer has harvested 100 quintals of potato from one acre, he will get only Rs 45,000 in the market and will face a minimum loss of Rs 30,000 per acre,"" said Dhot, who has cultivated potatoes on 400 acres.Resham Singh Chandi, vice-president, potato grower association Kapurthala, blamed the government for this situation and said that if the government had not put a ban on the export of potatoes the farmers would have got good prices of their hard-work.""If the apathetic government still fails to give attention to the issue, the price of the crop may drop further in coming days and the farmers would not be able to bear the losses then,"" he said.Meanwhile, supervisor of vegetable market, Sukhdev Singh said that the fall in prices was due to the increased harvest. ""It is obvious that the rates will be go down when the production of the crop increases and demand decreases,"" he said.Despite repeated attempts, Dr Manohar Singh, chief agriculture officer, Kapurthala, could not be reached for comments."
18,Govt aims at 4% growth in agriculture,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Govt-aims-at-4-growth-in-agriculture/articleshow/46059533.cms,2015-01-30,The Times Of India,"NAGPUR: To achieve the projected growth rate of 4% in agriculture in the XII plan, the new government at the Centre has launched a number of initiatives that will directly or indirectly benefit farmers and agriculture. The government has especially made specific financial provisions for this.Jai Prakash Mishra, agriculture adviser, National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, told TOI that the Central government was taking all care to ensure the agriculture growth 4% was achieved. One of the biggest scheme under these initiatives focuses on 'price stabilization'. ""A Rs500 crore price stabilization fund has been approved by the standing finance committee and is awaiting cabinet approval,"" he said.Mishra was in city for a national seminar on 'sustainable management of land resources for livelihood security' organized by the Indian Society for Soil Survey and Land Use Planning at the auditorium of National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS&LUP).Three major crops to be covered under price stabilization are onion, tomato and potato as their prices are very volatile. The government has plans of involving National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED) and National Council for Farmers Cooperatives (NCFC) that will be made to procure farmers produce in case of crisis. They will be given working capital from the corpus. These agencies can store the produce and release it in market at right time with right price so that farmer is not put to loss. ""This will introduce price regime and prevent distress sale. It will create a win-win situation or farmer as well as organizations,"" said Mishra.The list of other priorities include soil health cards, creation of agriculture infrastructure (government has created a Rs200 crore fund for creating e-connectivity and e-market), and the krishi sinchana yojna with a provision of Rs1000 crore. Mishra said an important component of these was 'bringing economies of scale' to agriculture. To get right price for farm produce, government was supporting the concept of farmers or producer companies or farmers groups. Another step towards improving agriculture was 'infusion of innovation and technology' in areas where technology had not reached yet and also improving technology where it exists, concentrating on proven technologies in a given area, direct transfer of funds of various government schemes to implementing agencies, incentives to performing states in the form of 'Karman' award.Mishra asserted agriculture could be changed for better as had been proved under the National Food Security Mission where against the expected target of 20 million tonnes of food grains in XI plan, the country produced 40 MT. This was made possible with three things, use of existing machinery, involvement of existing state extension departments and project management teams."
19,Rakibul stress on double cropping,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150202/jsp/northeast/story_11140.jsp,2015-02-02,Telegraph,"Rakibul Hussain speaks at the newsconference in Guwahati on Sunday.Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Feb. 1: Newly appointed Assam agriculture minister Rakibul Hussain today said his department would stress on double cropping to improve agricultural productivity of the state. Addressing a news conference here, Hussain said in many areas of Upper Assam districts, farmers are content with a single crop per year. ""We will take up a special scheme covering all Upper Assam districts from Golaghat to Tinsukia on the south bank and from Darrang to Dhemaji on the north to encourage farmers to go for double cropping or even triple cropping in a year,"" the minister said. He said in the first phase, their target is to cover 15,000 bighas, which is currently under single cropping. Chief minister Tarun Gogoi will inaugurate the scheme in the next 10 to 15 days, he said. Hussain took over the reins of the agriculture department after his predecessor Nilamani Sen Deka was dropped from the Tarun Gogoi ministry in the recent reshuffle. He said completing the schemes initiated by Deka would be one of his priorities. Hussain emphasised that if the agricultural growth rate of the state is to be improved, the cropping intensity will have to increase. The minister said electric pumps would be used for irrigation wherever electricity is available as electric pumps are more economical than diesel pumps. ""We will also distribute summer paddy ( boro and early ahu) seeds among the farmers,"" he said. ""If farmers don't get minimum support price (MSP), the government will procure from them at that price to avoid distress sale,"" he said. Hussain said a room would be provided for the agriculture development officer and village-level extension worker to sit in every block office in all the 219 development blocks in the state so that farmers get easy access to them. ""Till now, agriculture development officers and village-level extension workers have no office to sit in. Hence, the farmers had to face difficulties in meeting them. We are going to resolve this long-pending problem faced by the farmers,"" he said. According to the minister, the state government will appoint separate directors for horticulture and food processing, which are currently under the director of agriculture, to give a boost to these two sectors. Hussain said he would ensure the procurement of high quality seeds from reputed companies like National Seeds Corporation (NSC) and stern action like blacklisting will be taken if any firm is found to be supplying poor quality seeds. He announced that they are going to launch a ""special potato productivity mission"" to make the state self-sufficient in potato production. ""We will also set up 440 low-cost onion storage structures in the state in fiscal 2014-15 to help the onion farmers,"" he said. Against the requirement of 29 lakh metric tonnes, the potato production in the state is 11.5 lakh MT whereas the onion production is 0.85 lakh MT against a requirement of 4.5 lakh MT per year. Hussain said the surplus in rice production has increased in 2014-15 compared to the previous year. In 2014-15, the state had a surplus rice production of 6.3 lakh MT compared to 4.6 lakh MT in 2013-14."
20,No time for bats  to rest easy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/457550/no-time-bats-rest-easy.html,2015-02-03,Deccan Herald,"No time for bats to rest easyNatalie Angier, Feb 4, 2015, INYT 0:05 ISTFor every 1 million bats killed by white-nose syndrome, 692 tonnes of insects go undevoured each summerThe 10 hibernating little brown bats hang from a corner of their tailor-made refrigeration chamber at Bucknell University like a clump of old potato skins, only less animated.In torpor, bats become one with their wintry surroundings, their body temperatures falling to just above freezing, their heart rates slowing to one or two beats a minute, their breathing virtually undetectable.But suddenly, a male yanks himself free of the bunch and hops down to a dish on the floor. After taking a long, slow drink of water, he uses the claws on his folded wings to hoist himself along the wire mesh of the chamber, his motions angular, deliberative and spidery. A second bat rappels down for a drink, and then a third.Well, thats a lucky break, said Thomas Lilley, a postdoctoral fellow from Finland. As Bucknells de facto bat concierge, Lilley helps wild bats acclimate to life in captivity, a difficult task with an urgent spur.He and his colleagues are labouring mightily to understand white-nose syndrome, a devastating fungal disease that has killed at least 6 million North American bats since it first appeared in Albany, New York, a decade ago and that threatens to annihilate some bat species entirely.Because the fungus attacks bats as they hibernate in caves, the researchers are exploring the complex biology of normal bat hibernation, and so-called arousal bouts turn out to be a big part of the puzzle, said Kenneth Field, an associate professor of biology.Hibernating bats will warm themselves out of torpor every week or two throughout the winter, for several hours at a stretch. Although researchers dont understand the reasons for the thermal interludes, they have quantified just how important such thaws must be to bat survival.All the work that bats do during the fall, feeding nonstop and putting on fat until theyre like butterballs on wings, and 90 percent is spent to sustain the winter warm-ups, said DeAnn Reeder, a professor of biology and one of the nations leading bat ecologists.New research suggests that white-nose syndrome begins disrupting the arousal-torpor cycle long before any telltale white fuzz appears on the bats face and wings and that the disorder really spins out of control when the bats immune system behaves in a distinctly unbatlike manner, mounting a zealous response against the fungal spores.Unbatlike because, as scientists are discovering, the bat immune system is astonishingly tolerant of most pathogens - a trait that could pose risks to people but that also offers clues to preventing human diseases of aging, including cancer.Evidence is mounting that bats can serve as reservoirs of many of the worlds deadliest viruses, including the pathogens behind Ebola, Marburg and related hemorrhagic fevers; acute respiratory syndromes like SARS and MERS; and even familiar villains like measles and mumps.Yet, bats appear largely immune to the many viruses they carry and rarely show signs of the diseases that will rapidly overwhelm any human, monkey, horse, pig or other mammalian host the microbes manage to infiltrate. Scientists have also learned that bats live a seriously long time for creatures of their small size.The insectivorous Brandts bat of Eurasia, for example, weighs an average of just 6 grams, compared with 20 grams for a mouse. But while a mouse is lucky to live for a year, the Brandts bat can survive well into its 40s  a disparity between life span and body mass that a report in Nature Communications called the most extreme of all mammals.Researchers are scrutinising bat DNA and the details of the bat vocation for clues to what sets the flying mammals apart from other members of the lactating clade. Preliminary findings indicate that bats apparent indifference to the viral throngs they harbour, together with their Methuselah-grade longevity, probably arose from the adaptations needed to grant them the power of flight.Bat experts argue that a keener understanding of bat biology could not only help prevent the next outbreak of Ebola or other cross-species zoonotic infection but also offer a fresh take on immune and inflammatory disorders like diabetes or heart disease.Scientists warn against misguided calls in some areas for the culling of bats as a way to combat the risk of viral transmission, and they urge the public not to succumb to old-fashioned bat phobia that long linked bats to witches, vampires, demons and cobwebs.Bats play essential roles in the environment, researchers said. Insectivorous bats are the top predators of night-flying insects, including mosquitoes: Reeder estimated that for every 1 million bats killed by white-nose syndrome, 692 tons of insects go undevoured each summer.Fruit- and nectar-eating bats are major pollinators and seed dispersers. Scientists traditionally have divided bats into two big suborders: the fruit-eating megabats and insect-eating microbats, deeming the groups so distinct they might have evolved flight independently.Yet, a recent genomic analysis in the journal Science reveals that the ability to fly dates to the earliest days of the bat lineage, some 90 million years ago, and that megas did not split from micros for another 10 million years, after which the micros alone evolved the capacity for echolocation, to help them hunt their insect prey.Metabolic byproductsWhen a bat flies, its heart beats an impressive 1,000 times a minute, and its metabolism ramps up 15-fold over resting rate. By contrast, said David Blehert of the US Geological Surveys National Wildlife Health Centre in Madison, Wisconsin, the metabolism of a running rodent is seven times normal, and thats only for a short burst, whereas a bat can fly at 15-fold metabolic rate for hours.All that fiery flapping ends up generating a huge number of metabolic byproducts called free radicals, which could mutilate the bats DNA were it not for its extra-strength molecular repair crew. And countering DNA damage happens to be a great strategy for overall health, which could explain bats exceptional longevity and apparent resistance to cancer.Bats often live in colonies of hundreds of thousands. They travel long distances and are exposed to a staggering array of pathogens. They cannot afford to be flustered by every freeloading microbe, and for the most part, they are not.That makes the lethality of white-nose syndrome that much more confounding. Here we have an animal that can survive some of the scariest viruses we know, Blehert said, and its undone by a common soil fungus.His team has found that, starting at the earliest stages of infection, afflicted hibernating bats begin burning twice as much energy as unaffected bats. Reeder and her colleagues have shown that bats with white-nose come out of hibernation twice as often as healthy bats.And while normal bats spend much of their arousal time resting, sick bats dont, she said. Instead, theyre grooming constantly, so their arousals are even more costly.The ultimate blow may come from the bats immune response to the fungus, which preliminary evidence suggests is unusually strong. And that, Field said, could be whats dooming the bats."
21,Horticultural exports need more sensitivity,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/457756/horticultural-exports-need-more-sensitivity.html,2015-02-04,Deccan Herald,"Horticultural exports need more sensitivityK Lenin Babu., Feb 5, 2015, dhns 0:21 ISTEU had imposed a ban on fruit and vegetables after 207 Indian consignments were contaminated by pests.The recent news over lifting the ban on export of mangoes from India to the European Union (EU) was welcomed by various stakeholders in India. The EU accounts for about half of the overall fruit and vegetable exports from India.Within the EU, the United Kingdom accounts for the most export, followed by Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. India, of its annual production of 1.5-1.6 million tonnes of mangoes, sells 65,000-70,000 tonnes in the global market. In 2013-14, it exported mangoes worth $50.7 million. For the first six months of year 2014-15, mango exports stood at $43.9 million.EU imposed a ban on mangoes (Mangifera sp) along with vegetables like bitter gourd (Momordica sp), snake gourd (Trichosanthes sp), egg plant (Solanum melongena) and taro (Colocasia sp). This ban came into place after 207 Indian consignments of fruit and vegetables were found to contaminated by pests like fruit flies and tobacco white flies in the infested shipments.Neither is harmful to humans, but both could pose a serious threat to tomato and salad crops in Europe, which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Because of the ban, mango exports to the EU fell from $8.9 million in 2013-14 to $1.1 million in 2014-15 (April-September)  about an eight times drop.It is a legitimate function of national governments to prevent the import of goods that threaten human, animal and plant health. Hence, each nation can impose certain minimum conditions/ standards to which imports should match.However, imposition of standards at national borders can impede international trade because it may result either in the banning of imports or reduced profitability of exporting as a cost of compliance.In this context, to ensure free and fair trade, under the WTO regime, a separate agreement on the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement), was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of WTO negotiations.The food codeCodex Alimentarius (a food code in Latin) was adopted as the basis for SPS. The Codex Alimentarius was set up jointly in the 1960s by two organisations of the United Nations  the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO)  with an objective of guiding and promoting the elaboration and establishment of definitions and requirements for foods, to assist in their harmonisation and, in doing so, to facilitate international trade.One of commonly known parameters of Codex standards is residues of unwanted or harmful agrochemicals used in various stages of production such as Maximum Residue Levels (MRL) of pesticides.The other one is the presence of unwanted microbes, as was the case with Indian mangoes. However, SPS provides the flexibility to importing nations to amend the Codex standards and adopt their nation specific set of standards, which could be far more stringent than that of CodexIndias diverse climate ensures availability of all varieties of fresh fruit and vegetables. It ranks second in production in the world, after China. During 2012-13, the area under cultivation of fruit stood at 6.98 million hectares while vegetables were cultivated at 9.21 million hectares, producing 81.285 million metric tonnes of fruits and 162.19 million metric tonnes of vegetables according to National Horticulture Database published by the National Horticulture Board.During 2013-14, India exported fruit and vegetables worth Rs 8760.96 crore which comprised fruit worth Rs 3298.03 crore and vegetables worth Rs 5462.93 crore. Mangoes, walnuts, grapes, bananas and pomegranates dominate fruit exports while onions, okra, bitter gourd, green chilles, mushrooms and potatoes contribute to the vegetable export basket.The major destinations for Indian fruit and vegetables are UAE, Bangladesh, Malaysia, UK, Netherlands, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Fruit exports from Karnataka have touched Rs 488 crore during 2013-14. The state exported 238 tonnes of fruit including mango, grape, sapota, pineapple, banana and pomegranate among others.Though Indias share in the global market is still nearly 1 per cent only, there is increasing acceptance of horticulture produce from the country. This better performance was due to concurrent developments in the areas of state-of-the-art cold chain infrastructure and quality assurance measures. Apart from large investment pumped in by the private sector, the public sector has also taken initiatives.With assistance of Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Ministry of Commerce, several Centers for Perishable Cargoes and integrated post harvest handling facilities have been set up in the country. Capacity building initiatives at the levels of farmers, processors and exporters have also contributed towards higher exports.Dominating presence of Merchant-Exporters (which procures from producers and re-exports same) in export sectors is one weak link that makes Indian exports prone to such bans. Merchant-Exporter comes into the supply chain at very late stages with no or very little influence over the quality of produce.Investment in measures to increase awareness at farmers groups about the requirements of international market, encouraging them to enter into the export sector are bound to pay dividends in years to come."

While staples like wheat flour and rice have become marginally costlier, prices of pulses like masoor and arhar have soared by up to 30%. Barring a few exceptions, prices of vegetables and fruits have shot up by 20 to 50% , and for popular winter fare like peas and leafy vegetables, by nearly 100%.According to APMC (Azadpur) data, between January 31, 2014 and Jan 30, 2015, the wholesale price of peas rose 106%, spinach by 94%, carrots by 89%, beans by 68%, cabbage by 61%, brinjal by 57%, methi by 56%, bhindi and green chillies by 47%, onion by 40% and tomato by 33%.Unlike the dramatic spikes witnessed during the Manmohan Singh government, when prices would increase manifold in the space of a few weeks before settling down, the present inflation is a slow, simmering fire rising steadily over a period of months. But the effect is the same  an erosion of family budgets and, among the large number of limited income households in Delhi, even an erosion in their nutritional intake.This slow-burning food inflation may be one of the reasons for the quick disaffection of poorer people in Delhi with the Modi government, as reflected in the close contest between BJP and AAP. Just eight months ago, BJP had swept all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, getting 46% of the votes polled, with promises of fighting price rise being one of its key attractions.Most low income families depend on vegetables to make up their main meals along with chapatis because pulses (dals) went out of reach several years ago. But most vegetables are now selling in Azadpur's wholesale mandi at prices that are insufferably high. By the time these reach the hapless consumer there is usually a further 30-50% mark-up as it passes through a chain of middlemen.Of the Big Three among vegetables  potato, onion and tomato  potatoes are marginally cheaper in the wholesale markets but onions are substantially up by 40% and tomatoes by 33%.Even winter vegetables like carrots, peas, spinach and methi are selling at 50-100% more than one year ago. Similarly, winter fruits like guavas, grapes and apples are selling at prices that are 30% or more higher. Prices of only oranges and bananas have fallen."

She looks here and there and then empties the bin on the street below. Nobody, she thinks, is watching. She must have been kidding herself. A group of children playing on the street jeer her. For long, the brief for ad filmmakers has been to lure customers towards brands: potato chips, long-duration batteries, cars, suits, even banks; in fact, all perishable and non-perishable symbols of a brand-conscious world. But things have changed since the Narendra Modi government hired professionals from top advertising agencies in the country topromote some of its key initiatives-from the Clean India and Make-in-India campaigns to women's safetyand messages against female foeticide. The idea is to get people to change long-standing habits, but in a ""different"" manner. Malavika Mehra, who has spent 20 years as a wordsmith forging messages to tempt customers into lightening their wallets, is now doing precisely that. Mehra,national creative director atGreyGroup India, led the team that created the Swachh Bharat ad. ""Selling branded goods and changing attitudesdemandsa different treatment,"" said Sunil Lulla, chief managing director, Grey Group India. ""Here we're trying to influence the mind, the heart or both to change attitudes."" But ""preachy"" - often the trait of traditional government ads - is out. The accent now is on ""subtlety"". Take, for instance, the ad that shows a young girl looking lost on a deserted railway platform late at night. But the Jab We Met moment passes soon. Two policemen appear and urge the girl towaitin the lounge inside. She refuses.Then a woman cop appears.The girl breathes a sigh of reliefand walks inside. The message: more womenare needed in the police force. An official in the information and broadcasting ministry said the government, which hired A-list agencies to spread the messages, ""made it very clear about what it wanted"". Maneka Gandhi, for example, said officials in the women and child welfare ministry, was so keen on catchy,professionally made adson theBeti Bachao andwomen's safety campaignsthat shespent hours brainstormingwith members of creative teams of ad agencies. ""In the Beti Bachao ads, we've tried to drive home the point that the killing of female foetuses is both unethical and illegal and raise awareness about India's decreasing sex ratio,"" said Samir Datar, vice-president with the Grey Group. Other ministries have been equally focused on spreading their message. ""We worked closely with top officials in the finance ministryfor 10 days after which the campaign layout was finalised and it took usanothermonth to create ads for them,"" said Sangeetha N., executive creative director at RK Swamy BBDO that worked on theJan Dhan Yojana, a scheme that opened bank accounts to millions of India's poor. ""We have doneadsfor the governmentbefore,but the intensity of government involvement was much higher this time,""said Sangeetha, whose work covers a gamut of clients and is known for catchy taglines, including ""The Complete Man"" for Raymond, ""Why go anywhere else"" for the Life Insurance Corporation and ""The Future of the automobile"" for Mercedes Benz. Senior executives at Weiden and Kennedy that designed Modi's much-touted ""Make In India"" campaign,which has emerged as a key plank of the Prime Minister's economic agenda, said it was put together after weeks of interactions with topofficials,including Amitabh Kant, secretary, department of industrial policy and promotion. According to officials intheDirectorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity- the nodal agency for expenses on ad campaigns- the government has spent about Rs 150 crore on these multimedia campaigns.

This year, however, Rs 7 crore has been allotted to create awareness among people to adopt rooftop water harvesting and ground water recharge practices to meet the domestic water needs. The scheme will continue till 2019. On the other hand, Rs 100 crore allotted for the potato mission will be equally divided to ensure greater production and create a buffer stock across the state. The water harvesting scheme christened ""rooftop rainwater harvesting and ground water re-charge in urban areas,'' will provide intensives to an extent of 50 per cent of the actual cost or maximum up to Rs 45,000 for each house in government and private sector to implement water harvesting structures.'' Initially the scheme will be implemented in Bhubaneswar, Berhampur, Jharsuguda, Balangir and Titlagarh and later it will be replicated across the state. Last year's potato crisis did not escape finance minister Pradip Kumar Amat's attention as he created a budgetary provision to spend Rs 50 crore to make Odisha self-sufficient in it. While the mission will try to increase the production of potato from 2 lakh tonnes to 12 lakh tonnes by 2017-18, the horticulture directorate will be the nodal agency for achieving the target. With restriction in the movement of potato-laden trucks to Odisha from the neighbouring state affecting the consumers hard every year, the state government will create a buffer stock of potato through advance procurement to meet the shortage in supply and stabilise the price. Amat proposed a revolving corpus fund of Rs 50 crore with the Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited through National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed). The 2015-16 budget has an increased outlay of Rs 1,361.40 crore than the outlay in 2014-15. While agriculture outlay in the current budget is Rs 10,903.62 crore, last year it was Rs 9,542.22 crore.

The move, senior government officials said, showed that the state government's intervention in the market for the past two years to keep the price of the tuber under control had caused trouble to consumers and farmers. According to Nabanna officials, farmers who have already harvested the new potato are being forced to sell their produce at Rs 4 a kg these days, lower than last year, when it sold for Rs 7 to Rs 8 a kg. The control order was issued last year, when the price of potato had shot up to Rs 22 a kg, to ensure that nobody could hoard to create an artificial crisis. ""But the order has now become a barrier for farmers. The order was withdrawn a few days ago,"" said a senior Nabanna official. Agriculture department officials explained that traders were not showing interest in procuring potato from farmers as they thought they could face trouble if they stocked more than 2,000 tonnes. The lack of buyers forced the farmers to sell their produce at a much lower price. The Bengal government had fixed a maximum retail price for the tuber for the past two years - Rs 14 and Rs 16 a kg, respectively. The state had also fixed a maximum storage limit for an individual and issued a blanket ban on export. ""The intervention caused a severe damage to the entire system,"" said a city-based industrialist, who is associated with agro-business and potato products. He said the government tried to play with the demand and supply rule that determines the price of a commodity. ""The price of potato remained at Rs 24 a kg for the major part of last year as the traders created an artificial crisis in the market by holding back their stock in the cold stores."" A section of traders said despite the withdrawal of the control order, they are apprehensive of buying a large stock from the farmers. ""For the past two years, the government had issued a blanket ban on export and we incurred losses... We are not sure whether there will be a ban this year too,"" said a potato trader. Senior government officials said that in order to give some relief to the farmers, the state government could have procured some potato at a better price. ""This could have helped the farmers and the consumers too as the govern-ment could have released the stock in the market whenever price of the produce goes up in the market,"" said an official. But the finance department has rejected a proposal on this. ""The agriculture marketing department had sought a sum of Rs 100 crore to initiate the scheme... But the finance department rejected it,"" said a senior government official adding that such a scheme would have been helpful, instead of imposing a ban on export."

The names of these two state ministers haven't surfaced in the Saradha scam.One of the photographs with CBI shows two Trinamool leaders  an MP and an MLA  attending an Angel Group event to mark the launch of a vernacular newspaper where the CMD of the group is being felicitated by them. Also under the scanner are at least three BJD politicians from Odisha for their alleged links with these firms. Sources in the CBI said the agency will again summon Angel Group CMDHasibur Haq and the other directors soon.CBI officers are now questioning agents of the group that allegedly raised at least Rs 800 crore from Bengal and Odisha and had close ties with several ruling party MPs, MLAs and even councillors. CBI sources said at least five KMC councillors helped the group set up its Kolkata office.Angel Group, which offered schemes related to packaged water, agriculture and media in 2010, wound up operations in 2013 after the Saradha bubble burst. Cops have filed cases against the group under sections related to ""criminal breach of trust, cheating, criminal conspiracy and violation of prize chit money circulation scheme banning act"", the same under which the CBI is probing the Saradha scam.Among the Angel officials who are under scanner are Tarun Kumar Barui, Ranjit Santra, Susanta Mohapatra, Ananta Barik and Parimal Biswas. CBI joint director Rajeev Singh and Special Investigating Team (SIT) DIG S Bagchi took stock of the agency's progress in the investigation in Bengal and Odisha on Monday.CBI said the Angel firms were set up on the Saradha model. They used to promise depositors 30% to 100% returns on their investments within 15 to 18 months through several schemes related to production of tea, potatoes and their sale in the market. ""The percentage of profit would depend on the market price of these products. It took 15 months to complete the whole business cycle and return to the investor the sale value of his 'products'.

He said latest technology agronomics would be used to meet the emerging need of virus-free and certified seed potato.The spokesman said the centre would also come with techniques of post-harvest handling and storage with latest storage and monitoring systems to improve shelflife of the produce. He said the trained task force would help farmers as per standardised Dutch technology by stakeholders in the potato chain.He said with the adoption of the proposed technologies, potatoes would be saved from 16 kinds of viruses, enhance shelflife of different varieties and seed would be produced in air instead of soil which would be further germinated and hardened in net houses."

Farmers are already worried over the prospect of bearing huge losses due to a sudden drop in potato prices right before the harvesting season.These crops which take three-four months to mature are generally sown between February-end and mid-March and are harvested before the cultivation of paddy in June. Kuldeep Singh, a farmer, said their hope to earn profit from mid-term crops have also been dashed to the ground due to recent rainfall in the region.If the rainfall does not stop for some more days it will not be possible for us to cultivate kharif crops and the only option we will be left with is to wait for four months to cultivate paddy, he said. Tarsem Singh, another farmer, said the timing of rain is not good for wheat crop either since it needs sunny weather to attain adequate size.Agriculture development officer Dr Jaswinder Singh said due to sudden rainfall farmers missed the opportunity to cultivate maize. These are bonus crops for farmers as if these mature without any disease and farmers could make good income of around rs 80,000 per acre, he said.Horticulture development officer Dr Sukhdip Singh Dhillon said farmers still have an opportunity to cultivate vegetables and fruits if the rainfall stops at this stage."

35,"Waiter, there's a PM in my soup",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150303/jsp/nation/story_6636.jsp,2015-03-03,Telegraph,"Modis younger brother Prahlad at a protest organised by fair price shop dealers in Mumbai. (PTI) New Delhi, March 2: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today blew into the Parliament canteen, joining a handful of star-struck MPs for a bite and chitchat. Lunch over, the four who shared his table were left to chew over a delicate question: how much did the PM tip the waiter, or did he at all? Some of them marvelled at his "" badhappan"" (large-heartedness) in deigning to dine with commoners. But the generosity seemed to have boundaries, perhaps in sync with economic theories that frown at free lunches. When the bills were handed out separately, each member, including the Prime Minister, paid for himself. Modi usually gets his meals hot from home around noon but, an aide said, he today decided to ditch his staple khichdi-kadhi and sample the canteen fare. Around 1pm, he walked up to Room 70 on Parliament House's first floor, a couple of his security officials in tow, and made for the table shared by his party's Sasaram MP Chhedi Paswan and Gujarat Rajya Sabha member Mansukh Mandaviya. ""I was shocked to see the Prime Minister. I had no idea he would be coming to the canteen because there was no sign of the security check that usually precedes his visits to any place,"" Paswan said. ""I looked at my fellow MP and we wondered what was happening. By then Modiji was sitting right next to us."" The Prime Minister asked for the menu. Supervised by A.P. Jithender Reddy of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, the canteen nowadays boasts a Hyderabadi flavour, replete with biryani, mirch ka salaan and qubani ka meetha. Being a shuddha shakahari - ""pure"" vegetarian -Modi ordered a bowl of vegetable soup and a veggie thali (platter). It came with two rotis, dal, a preparation of spinach, a potatoes and rajma curry, a bowl of yoghurt, salad and a helping of rice. Nobody was sure how much the Prime Minister had enjoyed the food. But he polished off everything except the rice as his awestruck companions pecked at their food. Soon, two others - minister Piyush Goyal and Gujarat MP Shankar Vegad - joined the high table. ""They must have sniffed the PM's presence from afar,"" Paswan joked. Modi made small talk, asking Paswan about the pre-election scene in Bihar. ""I have worked under his rule for years in Gujarat; so we just spoke for a while informally,"" Mandaviya said. Paswan confessed himself boggled by Modi's munificence. ""It's good to occupy a high post but it's better to own a large heart. Modiji has it,"" he averred. ""It's not every day that the country's Prime Minister dines with plebs like us."" Not even Parliament old-timers could recall any Prime Minister having dined in the canteen before. ""At best, a PM may have ordered food to his room. Usually, they get food from home,"" an MP said. Modi's bill was modest. Which leads to the thorny question: how much do you tip on a bill of Rs 28? Or an imponderable one: did the Prime Minister gain - or even retain - a voter in the waiter? At Parliament's central hall, which has a running food service for members, the most popular among the servers are those lawmakers who regularly tip them 100-rupee notes. ""Why should the PM offer tips? The rules don't say so,"" Mandaviya protested. ""It's not about the money,"" added Paswan. ""We hope his surprise visit will improve the quality of food and general hygiene."""

Senior officials said the move was a ""desperate attempt"" by the government to cover up its ""mishandling"" of the situation over the past two years. The government had intervened in the potato market by fixing the price and banning export, which led to a hike in its prices. The officials said the procurement and export amount fixed by the government was too little as the state had produced 1.2 crore tonnes of potato this year. ""The price of potato has dipped this year because of a bumper production. This caused problems for the farmers.

""We will give Rs 10 crore as transport subsidy to the traders so that they are encouraged to export the produce,"" the chief minister said. Farmers are being forced to sell their produce at Rs 4 a kg because they are not getting buyers. The majority of the farmers don't have the financial capacity to store the produce and wait for better times, officials said.

As potato traders are not coming forward to buy the produce on a large scale, the price of potato has fallen significantly this year,"" a senior government official said.

""Around 1.2 crore tonnes of potato has been produced in Bengal this year. The state, however, produces a similar amount every year. This can't be the reason behind traders losing interest in buying the produce this year,"" an official said. Potato traders said they did not go for large-scale procurement this year as they were not sure whether the government would allow them to export the produce throughout the year. ""Our past experience is not good. We could not take the produce out of Bengal last year despite the state having a huge stock in cold storages,"" a trader said. The state has a consumption requirement of 60 lakh tonnes of potatoes annually, which means an equal amount can be exported. ""But the government has allowed traders to export only 2 lakh tonnes.

Rates of leafy vegetables were up at the Muhana Mandi on Saturday while prices of all other vegetables are likely to move upwards soon.Immediate impact of abrupt rains was evident on green, leafy vegetables, which are difficult to store and easily perishable. The crop which was about to be harvested has been completely destroyed. Spinach sold at Rs 35 per kg in wholesale while methi (fenugreek) too rallied at Rs.30 per kg.

41,Water metering: Primed for politics,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Water-metering-Primed-for-politics/articleshow/46500890.cms,2015-03-09,The Times Of India,"The 14th finance commission has recommend ed that by March 2017 states should move to wards 100% metering of water for domestic, commercial and farm use. It said that the me tering should happen at all households, com mercial establishments and institutions, and a water regulatory authority - like the elec tricity regulatory authority - should be set up to determine tariff. For determining tax revenue allocation to individual states, the 14th finance commission used a formula that sets policy benchmarks for state governments. This year, for instance, forest cover was among the criteria used. Five years later, the next finance commission may well use water metering as a criterion - giving states lit tle choice but to go ahead with its implementa tion.In Tamil Nadu, domestic water supply is charged at a flat rate barring in a few local bod ies and for some high-volume users, which means there is little penalty for wastage or over use. Water supplying agencies such as Chennai Metrowater run up huge deficits each year and depend on government for budgetary support. This fiscal year, Chennai Metrowater's expenses was `987 crore while its income from taxes and charges was `497 crore till date - resulting in a deficit that it will bridge in-part through government grants. Last time the user charge of Metrowater was revised was in 2003.Since then, `50month has been the flat rate collected for each domestic connection irrespective of the consumption. ""People do not know how watersewerage charges are decided by the local bodies. These bodies revise when they run into serious deficits or when some financial institution who they approach for funding for their projects question the sustainability of their tariffs,"" said an urban development expert who works with the state government.Metering would establish the `user pay principle' for water and provide an incentive for water conservation, helping to detect water leakage in the distribution network - and make officials accountable. Census figures show that nearly 20% of TN's urban households and 35% of rural households do not get tap water - with the recent Hogenenakal and Ramanathapuram combined water schemes unable to reach tail-end users. Presently, only one tenth of the households in panchayats have houseline connections.Public health experts say that supplying clean, chlorinated piped water is the only way to reduce the incidence of many water-borne diseases. And charging a fair amount for it may be the only way to raise resources and upgrade water supply infrastructure. For instance, Chennai's supply is some 600 million litres per day (600 MLD) and the demand is likely to go up to more than 1,500 MLD by 2017. But the only major water source augmentation project in recent years has been desalination for which the state had to depend on funds from the Centre. ""I agree metering will help augment resources and bring sustainability to water utilities. This is one of the biggest problems with water supply , since the initial set up costs of a water treatment and distribution network usually comes as a grant from the government or donor. Operation and maintenance are to be paid out of earnings.However, if you look at the cost of supply vs charge, there is a huge discrepancy ,"" says Nitya Jacob, head of policy at Wateraid, an international non-profit organization that helps to provide water and sanitation to poor communities.Yet, just like power tariff, water meters and tariffs will be a political hot potato that few parties may be willing to take up now. A retired official who has worked on water policy recalls that ministers have been made chairman of Chennai Metrowater board since the late 1990s.""The idea was that they would take care of political sensitivities and move forward on reforms. But they have been unable to do that,"" the retired official said.What may derail the finance commission's suggestion in Tamil Nadu is charging for irrigation. The commission has argued that metering would encourage farmers to limit water use, adopt a cropping pattern best suited to the area and avoid over-irrigation. When successive state governments have baulked from metering farm power used to tap groundwater, leave alone charging even a token amount, charging for irrigation in a waterstarved state would likely kick off a political row. ""As long as water is not priced to farmers, it is good. It is not like drinking water supply ,"" says K Ramasamy, farming expert and member of the state planning commission.Ideological concerns over privatization and charging for the use of what belongs to the commons may get extended play on the political stage if the proposal is mooted in a state gearing up for elections in 2016. DMK spokesperson T K S Elangovan said water metering and water regulatory authority were impossible in Tamil Nadu, given that people here depend more on public taps and water tankers. ""Better utilisation of water resources, such as deepening tanks and increase in storage infrastructure, should be given foremost priority to maximise the supply ,"" he said."

A similar situation has arisen this year following a bumper potato harvest.The wholesale price in Deesa crashed to an all-time low after 2011. Despite 50kg bag of potato being priced at Rs 250 (Rs 5/kg) buyers were hard to find. Earlier, a 50kg bag was sold at Rs 600-700. ""We are facing tough time thanks to the bumper crop. Unseasonal rain too has harmed the potato farmers. Even Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, two chief potato producing states, are facing similar problems,"" said a leading farmer Odhaji Thakore.Adding to farmers' woes are the cold storage owners who have hiked rent by Rs 12.50 per 50kg bag. Mounds of potatoes can be seen lying in open fields with no space in cold storage facilities.""We are prepared to off load the stock but there are no buyers,"" lamented Thakore, adding that the government was not paying attention to their woes. ""Our main demand is better prices, freight-free transportation and scrapping of hike in cold storage rates,"" Thakore added. District collector Banaskantha, Dilip Rana, said, ""We are doing our best to deal with the situation. With regards to reduction of cold storage rates I will talk to the owners.""Thakore said, ""If the government fails to provide freight subsidy to transport potatoes to other states in the next few days, we will have to do what we did in 2011 - dump the potatoes on roads."" R M Patel a researcher at Sardar Krushinagar Dantiwada University, said, ""Bumper crop is big problem,"" adding, ""As against last year's 45,000 hectare, this year sowing was done in 52,000 hectare. The rates have fallen sharply,"" he said.There are 118 cold storages in Banaskantha with total capacity of 1.85 crore bags of 50kg. However, output this year is 2.75 crore bags.

44,Tragedy bares potato worry,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150311/jsp/bengal/story_8006.jsp,2015-03-11,Telegraph,"March 10: Two potato farmers allegedly committed suicide in Burdwan and Hooghly last night after failing to sell the bulk of their produce and secure a good price for the portion they could. While Guddu Murmu, who cultivated potato on a little over two acres in Burdwan's Bhatar, allegedly consumed pesticide, farmer Swapan Kundu hanged himself from a tree near his home in Hooghly's Khanakul. Murmu's family said he had taken a loan of Rs 50,000 and failed to sell even one-fourths of the 2,800kg of potato he produced. According to Kundu's wife, the Hooghly farmer had taken a loan of nearly Rs 1 lakh from a local cooperative. He was forced to sell 1,600kg of potato at Rs 3.20 a kg, much lower than the amount required to cultivate a kilo of the crop. Agriculture department officials said traders had been avoiding buying potato in bulk ever since a government ban on its export two years ago. Although the ban has been partially revoked, the traders are wary of the curb being imposed again. The situation has come to such a pass that farmers are being forced to sell potato at Rs 3 a kg in the majority of the areas. ""Farmers spend around Rs 4 to produce a kilo of potato.... Selling the produce at Rs 3 a kg would mean a lot of trouble for small and marginal farmers,"" an official said. Most small and marginal potato farmers in Bengal take loans from local moneylenders to buy seeds and fertilisers. This prevents them from storing the crop for long and waiting for the prices to rise because that would involve having to pay a higher interest for the loan. The Mamata Banerjee government has decided to buy 50,000 tonnes of potato directly from farmers and allow the export of 2 lakh tonnes. Agriculture department officials described the relief as ""too little"". Asked about the twin suicides, agriculture minister Purnendu Bose said: ""I won't be able to comment at this moment. I am yet to get a report on them."""
45,"After suicides, potato sops",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150312/jsp/bengal/story_8207.jsp,2015-03-12,Telegraph,"March 11: Agriculture minister Purnendu Bose today said the suicides of two potato farmers in Burdwan and Hooghly were not linked to distress sale but in the same breath announced measures to ensure that farmers got proper price for their produce. ""According to the reports I have received from the Hooghly administration, Swapan Kundu had taken a loan of Rs 80,000 from a local cooperative and was never under pressure to repay it immediately. Both sons of Swapan work in Punjab and earn well. The district authorities did not say his death was linked to the loan he had taken. The loan could have been repaid, had Swapan sold his produce at the prevailing price,"" Bose said at Nabanna today. On the death of Guddu Murmu, the farmer from Burdwan's Bhatar, the agriculture minister said he was a sharecropper and had not taken any loan from local moneylenders or any agency. ""Being a sharecropper, one does not need to invest in cultivation as inputs such as seeds and fertilisers are provided by the owner of the plots. The district administration informed us that he was an alcoholic,"" the minister said. Kundu's son Samaresh said he and his brother earned Rs 3,000 each in Punjab. When Bose's claim was conveyed to Ram Murmu, whose father Guddu consumed pesticide on Monday night, he could not believe what was being told to him. ""It would be better if the minister came to our humble home and saw for himself what my father used to do,"" Ram said. Minister Bose said the government would buy 10 to 15 tonnes of potato every day from farmers at Rs 5 a kg and sell it through government counters at Rs 7 a kg in Calcutta and Salt Lake. A farmer spends Rs 4 to produce 1kg of potatoes."

""The taste and texture of beef cannot be attained with other meat even if it is cooked using the same recipe. Also, beef can be consumed three-four times a week since it is more economically priced as compared to mutton.

Traders and vendors said that there is a drop of nearly 25% in vegetable prices due to a rise in supply. Locals have a variety of vegetables to choose from with the arrival of fresh cabbages, potatoes, lady fingers, cauliflowers and more.""Stock has increased, so prices of vegetables have naturally gone down,"" said vegetable traders in the Panaji market, adding, ""Consumers, therefore, are making the most of this price drop.""Carrots, both red and orange, that were being sold for 40 per kg earlier are now available at 30 per kg.

The prices will remain high but stable over the next one month, said officials at the city's Agriculture Produce Market Committee.Retail prices of kitchen essentials like onion, potato and tomato are well within the normal range, hovering around Rs 20/kg. Rates of vegetables like ladyfinger, cluster beans, capsicum, bottlegourd have registered an increase in the last 10 days, selling for approximately Rs 25-Rs 70 in the wholesale market and Rs 60/kg in the retail markets. Traders expect prices to normalize in a month's time.Wholesale prices of potatoes and onions are in check, as traders are releasing the stock of the last three months, explained Vilas Bhujbal, former chairman of the agri produce committee. ""Barring these and vegetables like tomato and cauliflower, prices of almost all vegetables have shot up and are likely to remain high for at least a month,"" he said.Prices are up by around 10-20%, said N D Gule, in-charge of the fruits and vegetables sub-section at the market committee. ""With a slight shortfall in supply, rates have shot up marginally. Plenty of green-leafy vegetables like spinach and coriander are reaching the city,"" he said.According to Ritesh Poman, a wholesale trader of onions, the supply has been normal and stable. ""On an average, 100-125 trucks carrying onions are reaching the wholesale market every day, which is normal for this time of the year. The untimely rain did not have an impact on the onion crop, therefore, the prices are expected to remain in check,"" he said.Vegetable retailer Satej Mishra too concurred. ""We are getting a good supply of vegetables, but rates are slightly on the higher side. Now that summer is approaching, rates are unlikely to shoot up,"" he said.The rain, however, took a toll on the first mango crop of the season, said Gule. ""Supply and quality of the first lot of mangoes is expected to be affected because of the rain. We are estimating a 20% increase in their prices this year,"" he said.Nathsaheb Khaire, a wholesale dealer of mangoes said, ""Mango blossom has fallen off because of the untimely rain. Farmers are now taking stock of how much crop has been affected. What has been saved will need to be salvaged by spraying a fresh round of fungicide. We expect the season to start after March 20."""

The distress caused by the abundant yield this year is evident, as farmers who used to sell potatoes directly from the fields are now forced to take the produce home. The bumper crop, coupled with weak demand from other States, has led to a free-fall in prices in West Bengal.Murmu, who was in his late fifties, had taken a loan of Rs. 50,000 from local moneylenders to cultivate potato in about five bighas (around two acres) of land as a sharecropper. He was shattered when the prices crashed and he killed himself by consuming pesticide on Monday.Buddhadeb Ansh, a local farm trader and money lender from the adjoining Ramchandrapur village, arrived at Murmus house on Wednesday and said the farmer had borrowed Rs 5,000 from him also.Last year the farmers sold potatoes at Rs. 350 to Rs. 400 per sack of 50 kilograms. This year, the prices have dropped below Rs. 150. In many cases, there are no takers even at lower prices, said Ansh,Murmu had to support a family of ten that includes his wife, three sons, daughters-in-law and grand children. His wife Kalamani has locked herself inside the thatched house at Chatimdanga village and refuses to speak.All the potatoes are lying in the fields, said Ram Murmu, Guddu Murmus son. The store [cold storage] is not taking potatoes any more. We do not know how we will survive.A few hundred metres away from Murmus home, another farmer Mukul Singh is busy harvesting from his field. Now we will also have to commit suicide, he said. Last year, I produced 150 sacks of potatoes in the two bighas of land that I cultivated and sold them at more than Rs. 350 per sack. This year the produce is higher but the prices are much lower, he said.Government denialSenior government functionaries meanwhile claim that Murmus family owns several bighas of land in the village and that his sons are employed outside the State. However, according to the family members and neighbours, Murmu did not own any land and all his sons were farmers in the village.States Agriculture Minister Purnendu Bose denied that the suicide had anything to do with the potato crisis but admitted there was distress selling by farmers. He said the government was buying potatoes for the mid-day meal and the ICDS projects and was in the process of lifting restrictions on sale to other States.Potato production this year has increased from 90 lakh tonnes to 1.10 crore tonnes. The cold storages in the State can hold not more than 74 lakh tonnes.The government is in the process of lifting restrictions on sale to other States"

The recent price of potato has been Rs150 per 50kg packet. It has fallen further to Rs120 per packet on Wednesday. Potatoes were sold at more than Rs360 to Rs400 for a 50kg packet around this time last year.There has been a bumper potato harvest here this season."

The state will have to submit its report on Thursday.Advocate Anindya Sundar Das, on whose PIL the court sought the report, said he moved HC in 2012 when several farmers had committed suicide, unable to bear the loss on account of poor potato prices. Apart from compensation for the families, Das wanted the state to have a policy so that farmers are not forced to sell in distress. Since farmer suicides are back this year, and due to the same reason, he recently made a petition in court while his PIL was being heard. Das said that though the court asked the state repeatedly to divulge its policy on preventing farmer suicides, it failed to give a proper reply. Rabi Shankar Chatterjee argued the case on Das's behalf.Agriculture minister Purnendu Bose said the state has already set up a guideline on how to deal with distress sale which will be sent to the court.On Friday, too, two farmers took pesticide in Burdwan. While one died, the other is fighting for life in hospital."

Two major entities at national level - National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) and Small Farmers Agri-business Consortium (SFAC) - will be tasked to procure the two major kitchen staples and store them so that the supply can be pumped in when prices go up.Sources said while Nafed has proposed to procure 10,000 tonnes of onion and recently sought Rs 9.6 crore sanction from the price stabilization fund, SFAC has sought Rs 5 crore for procuring onion and potato. ""The committee that is operating the fund has asked Nafed to rework its proposal to keep the amount limited to Rs 5 crore. Both Nafed and SFAC have been asked to coordinate so that they don't up buying same item,"" said an official privy to the panel's last meeting held on February 20.Onion prices start rising from July and usually it reaches peak during September-October. Similarly, potato prices go up abnormally between September and November.Both the agencies besides other state agencies would get financial support from the Rs 700 crore corpus of price stabilization fund to procure these items in advance when the prices are low and also buy items from different markets/ sources when prices start rising. In the second case, potato and onion would be sold at a price which will be little more than the procured price. ""Since the role of middlemen is eliminated in such case, the prices will be well within the reach of people. There will be no room for jacking up prices artificially.

But with rainfall once in a week there is a possibility that wheat production may be down by as high as 50%.Rupinder Singh Raja, a farmer who has cultivated wheat on 20 acres, said that including expenses such as seeds, irrigation, labour, pesticides and fuel, a farmer would have spent nothing less than Rs 14,000 per acre this season, productivity on which is 20-22 quintal/area.""Sudden rainfalls have damaged half of the crop due to which farmers will not be able to fetch their expenses spent on crop during cultivation,"" he said.Raja said that according to the minimum support price (MSP) one quintal wheat sold for Rs 1,400 and a farmer earns around Rs 35,000 per acre after selling wheat and fodder out of it.""This time farmer will hardly get the cost of production of Rs 14,000 per acre due to the damage inflicted by the rain,"" he said.The only way to recoup some losses seems to be shifting other crops. ""The farmers who have lost their whole crop, should substitute it by cultivating moong crop,"" CAO said."
56,Poor crop,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150317/jsp/opinion/story_9038.jsp,2015-03-17,Telegraph,"Monsoons and crops have their own rhythms; the government cannot do much about these. It can, of course, provide helpful conditions for farmers, such as access to reasonable loans, so that the whims of the elements - sky, earth, water and so on - and assaults by predators, such as a plague of worms, do not push them towards helplessness. Potatoes have been a sensitive subject with the West Bengal government for a while now, because, while being an unavoidable ingredient in the kitchen and an important cash crop, it goes through a cyclical pattern of overproduction and underproduction. Two potato farmers committed suicide recently, leading to fears that another cycle of debt-driven suicides were in the offing after 79 farmers had committed suicide in 2012. It is rather ironical that the two suicides occurred when the Calcutta High Court was hearing a public interest litigation that asked for a minimum support price for potato farmers and a policy by the government that would prevent potato farmers from selling the crop in distress. This PIL had originally been filed after the 2012 suicides. The court has asked the state to deliver a report of the measures it has been taking to address the potato farmers' problems. Undoubtedly, there is an important humanitarian side to the issue, and the honourable court's concern must be seen in that context. But it is also unsettling that the court should have to enquire into the potato trade. The judiciary's entry into a sphere of problems that have to be addressed from the administrative, economic and governance points of view is not a good omen for the balance of powers. Most important, long experience has proved that attempts to regulate the market have always failed. The state buying up excess stocks not only means losses for the government but is also an unfair burden on taxpayers. That the courts should even consider PILs that suggest support prices and other means of cushioning the farmer from the rules of the market is a waste of its time, apart from the fact that it is a blurring of the separating lines in the underlying framework of a separation of powers. The experience of the market is neither smooth nor comforting, but for the best results and for long-term prosperity and development, it is best to let the market correct itself and develop its own defence mechanisms. This will take time and patience, but there is just no magic short cut."

Similarly, prices of methi and cabbage which were only Rs 8 per kg on Friday have gone up to Rs 25 and Rs 12 per kg, respectively.Tomatoes, which were coming from Chomu and nearby areas of Jaipur, have stopped arriving at Muhana mandi, leading to rise in its price from Rs 12 per kg to Rs 20 per kg in three days.""The instant effect of unseasonal rain can be witnessed on all food items. Green and leafy vegetables which are difficult to store and are easily perishable have been affected most,"" says Radheyshyam Phatak, president of Rajasthan Fruits and Vegetable Wholesale Traders Association.Phatak said, ""Leafy vegetables could not sustain downpour in this season. They are completely destroyed. Total losses are yet to be calculated as information from several districts has not reached us so far.""Meanwhile, traders have warned that prices of vegetables will rise further in the coming days. They claimed hailstorm in Farrukhabad in UP, major supplier of potatoes and Nasikgaon (Maharashtra) received heavy rainfall.""Major suppliers of vegetables to Rajasthan are bordering Haryana, UP and Punjab. In all these places damage, vegetables were mostly affected. Consumers can expect a sharp rise in days ahead as their inflow in the state is likely to decrease,"" said Ashok Agarwal, a vegetable trader in Muhana mandi.Apart from vegetables, fruit prices are also shooting up. Kinnow in Ganganagar and oranges in Baran and Jhalawar have been hit by rain. Grapes that were to come in the market from Maharashtra are unlikely to be available. Pomegranate which were expected for bumper harvest due to increasing in sowing area have been lost due to hailstorm."

S. Kishore, a 1989-batch IAS officer who was the development commissioner of the Visakhapatnam SEZ, has replaced C.M. Bachhawat. ""Putting Kishore at the helm of the industries department is significant. It appears the Bengal government wants to use the experience of Kishore but it is not clear whether the administration would change its stance on SEZ,"" a Nabanna official said. Investment proposals of IT giants Infosys and Wipro are pending as the Trinamul government has not agreed to give SEZ status to development centres the companies are planning. ""Industry has not taken off since the change of guard in Bengal. Projects by Infosys and Wipro are stuck because the government doesn't want to grant SEZ status. We have to wait to see whether bringing Kishore to the industries department is a positive signal,"" another Nabanna official said. Some Nabanna officials said industries minister Amit Mitra was not happy with the performance of Bachhawat, who has been sent to the food processing and horticulture department. ""It is true that Bachhawat is a conservative officer. Some industry representatives had complained that he hardly gave time to them. But one cannot deny that he cannot be blamed for the lack of industrial activity in the state,"" a source said. Subrata Biswas, the agriculture secretary, was today transferred to the housing department. R.S. Shukla, the fire and emergency services secretary, has replaced him. Senior officials said the potato crisis could have triggered the move. Al least six potato farmers have committed suicide after failing to get the proper price. ""It was the department's failure to sense the crisis on time. If farmers don't get the price for their produce, somebody has to take responsibility as the ruling party is not ready face the wrath of farmers ahead of next year's Assembly polls,"" an official said. A minister said the government had failed to deliver in the agriculture sector. ""Farmers are not getting the right price for their produce. It is not a pleasant situation for a ruling party, particularly when Assembly polls are due in a year. So the chief minister wanted a change in the agriculture department,"" the minister said."

The staple either vanished or those, who had a few bags, would not give it without a premium.The scenario has changed in a few months. Sensing better returns, the farmers produced more potatoes, but there are no takers, leading to distress sale.In Balasore district farmers almost doubled the tuber growing area to nearly 1,000 hectare. ""We thought last year's experience would fetch us a good price. But, traders are not willing to lift potato at more than Rs 400 a quintal,"" said Khirod Sahu of Sitadhia village in Basta block.""Traders from neighbouring West Bengal even refuse to go beyond Rs 500 a quintal,"" said Jogendranath Sahoo, a farmer of Baliapal village.Official sources attributed the 'problem of plenty' to lack of storage facilities in the state. ""Odisha has just 26 cold storages. All are packed to capacity with potatoes. Areas not having storage facilities have pushed farmers to deep crisis. Over 50% of the produce is likely to perish in hot summer,"" said a senior official with horticulture department.Going by government's statement in the assembly on Saturday, Odisha annually needs about 11.21 lakh metric tonne (MT) of potato, but produces barely 2.5 lakh MT. This leaves the state to perpetually depend on outside for its staple.The problem reached a flashpoint last year because West Bengal government in order to help its people blocked supply of tuber to state. He said the situation might improve to some extent in the coming years, if the Potato Mission (A bid to increase potato output and storage capacity) promised by the government is implemented in letter and spirit.""The mission, among others targets, will set up 112 cold storages, each with a capacity of 5,000 MT, in three years. Each storage house will cost Rs 5.6 crore, half of which will be met through subsidies in scheduled areas."
70,Fertile ground for hot potatoes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150323/jsp/bengal/story_10337.jsp,2015-03-23,Telegraph,"Calcutta, March 22: Gujarat can, Uttar Pradesh can, Punjab can, but contract farming has remained a no-no in Bengal despite the change of guard in the state. Amid the latest potato crisis in Bengal - at least nine deaths since March 10 have been linked to the problem - some experts highlighted how the successive governments' aversion to a pragmatic approach of allowing contract farming was causing more problems in the market. In Bengal, around 4 lakh hectares were brought under potato cultivation and the agriculture department estimated that a total of 120 lakh tonnes of potato - at least 20 per cent more than the average annual potato production - had been produced. As Bengal has an annual consumption requirement of 60 lakh tonnes, the remaining will have to be sold to non-potato producing states. But a surplus production of potato in other states such as Uttar Pradesh and Punjab has brought down the demand of the crop from Bengal, resulting in prices being depressed. As Bengal has over 8 lakh potato farmers across Burdwan, Hooghly, Birbhum and West Midnapore, the government is trying to find a political solution to an economic problem by generously spending from the state exchequer. ""These do not solve the problems permanently. Next year or the year after that, the same problem of excess production will occur. But if the government continues to support the farmers by buying out their produce in case of excess production, they will never be careful in deciding their optimum quantity,"" said an agriculture department official. The Telegraph assesses the situation in Bengal and suggests what could be done to get rid of the problem. Government action 1. Buying out: The Mamata Banerjee government has decided to buy 50,000 tonnes of potato at Rs 5.50 a kg directly from farmers. Senior government officials said this would help small and marginal farmers earn a healthy return on their investments. 2. Withdrawal of control order: The state government has withdrawn all control orders issued in the past two years to contain the retail price of the produce that had gone up to Rs 25 a kg. The government had issued a blanket ban on export of potato to other states and on storing of more than 2,000 tonnes by a farmer in Bengal. 3. Transport subsidy: The Bengal government has decided to give subsidy to traders who would transport potato through railway or shipping. A total of Rs 100 crore would be spent for the purpose. Those who would export the produce using the railway freight carriage system would be given a subsidy of Rs 50 for each tonne while for shipping, the subsidy amount would be Rs 100 for one tonne. TT recommends: 1. Contract farming: The government should allow contract farming for better utilisation of surplus potato as it would ensure a steady buyer for the produce at a price that would not fluctuate with market conditions. In case of contract farming, the cultivators get seeds and fertilisers, besides technical know-how on how to raise productivity. But senior officials said the government is against contract farming as it feels that farmers are treated like bonded labourers in this system. ""The situation, however, is different in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat, where contract farming is helping cultivators realise a higher price for their produce,"" said an official. According to other officials, although there is a ban on contract farming in Bengal, a multi-national food processing company gives potato seeds and fertilisers to some farmers in Hooghly and buys back the produce at a good price. ""This year also, the farmers have sold their produce at a good price.... They did not have to depend on the demand in the markets. As the deal between the company and the farmers is not on paper and no farmer has lodged any complaint against this system so far, the government could not do anything to stop the practice,"" said an official. Apart from withdrawing the ban on contract farming, the government has to create an environment for food processing industries to invest here. For this, the government has to rethink its hands-off land policy and offer incentives to investors, the officials said. The government should also encourage farmers to cultivate the chipsona variety of potato, which is used in making chips and French Fries, instead of the conventional Jyoti and Pokhraj varieties. 2. Decontrol cold storage rent: The government has to decontrol the cold storage rent to modernise the existing facilities and encourage investors to set up new utilities in the state. As potato is cultivated once a year, unlike paddy, storage of the crop is important to keep it suitable for consumption and to export it to non-potato states through the year. For example, Bengal has produced 120 lakh tonnes of potato this year while its storage capacity is 65 lakh tonnes. So, nearly half the produce cannot be stored and it would rot within the next two months if not exported. Export of the tuber appears to be an uphill task because of the lack of demand in other states. ""Had there been enough storage capacity, we could have stored the produce and supplied it to other states when the demand for the produce would go up in the next few months. This could have helped the farmers get a better price,"" said an official. Sources in the cold store owners' association said the majority of the 450-odd stores in the state were more than 20 years old. The storage capacity of these stores could be enhanced if fresh investments are made. As the government controls the rental system in Bengal, it affects the owners in two ways. First, they find it difficult to pump in fresh funds to modernise the stores and cannot benefit from the central assistance disbursed to for the purpose, officials said. ""According to rules, if the state government wants central assistance for the stores to get modernised, it has to decontrol the rent management system,"" an official said. According to officials, the rent for storing a quintal of potato in Bengal is Rs 136, while it is Rs 194 in Uttar Pradesh. ""The difference in rent is preventing entry of new investors as they don't find it lucrative in Bengal,"" said a member of the cold store owners' association. 3. Stop intervening in the market: The steps initiated by the government make it clear that intervention in the market actually impacts adversely. ""Last year, storage of more than 2,000 tonnes was banned in Bengal. We apprehend that this could be re-introduced once the retail price of the produce go up in the next few months,"" said a potato trader in Burdwan. Similarly, this year's decision to buy the produce from the farmers at Rs 5.50 a kg is faulty. ""This is like an assurance that whatever you produce, the government will buy. If the farmers are aware of such a policy, would they ever be bothered about the quality and quantity of their produce?"" asked an expert. According to him, farmers in Gujarat have already started using machines to grade the produce and supply the buyers according to their requirements. ""The government has set up Krishak Bazars here, which are lying vacant. These facilities can be used for physically grading the produce. Machines can also grade the produce. Graded potato can fetch higher prices, but there is no attempt to initiate such measures,"" said the expert. ""If the government wants to help the farmers, they should come forward with know-how instead of spending tax payers' money by offering subsidies,"" he added."
71,"With rising oil prices, time to reduce LPG subsidy",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/467569/with-rising-oil-prices-time.html,2015-03-24,Deccan Herald,"Bhamy Shenoy, March 25, 2015, DHNS 9:06 ISTWhen oil prices collapsed, there was some expectation that the NDA government may take some hard decisions to reduce oil sector subsidies especially selling of LPG which help mostly the middle class and the rich. Unfortunately, the Narendra Modi government has so far not shown any signs of taking such a bold step. Ever since the introduction of LPG for residential use in 1980s, it has always been subsidised. Earlier, there was a need to popularise it. Now, it has become a political hot potato especially after the stunning success of AAP in Delhis election.Very few had predicted the fall in oil prices to the current low level in 2014. After reaching a high of $110 per barrel in June, 2014, Brent fell to a low level of $45 in January of this year. Since then, oil price has recovered to above $60, an increase of 38 per cent. Will oil prices fall or increase or remain around the current level? This is a million dollar question for which there is no definite answer. Forecasting oil prices is still an art than science because of many unpredictable factors.Still, oil experts from investment banks, private consulting companies, government agencies, etc., attempt to predict, if not a precise price. Having burnt their fingers in the past, economists from oil companies are not so brave today to take such a risk.For example, in a note published by Citibank in February, analysts found the possibility of crude oil falling to $20. On the other hand, JP Morgan analysts are predicting that oil prices might have bottomed out and are likely to rise. Similar predictions are made by International Energy Agency (IEA) and Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the US. There are some who even predict oil prices falling to $10 which is highly unlikely based on marginal cost of oil production to meet the demand. The EIA predicts an average price of $58 for 2015 and $67 for the fourth quarter.In recent months, oil price volatility has increased more than three times based on the analysis of oil future prices. Implied oil price range for December 2015 according to EIA is between $32 and $108. Reasons for such uncertainty are as follows.Though oil prices have fallen by more than 50 per cent, it is not clear how supplies will respond. A recent study by Wood Mackenzie, an energy research organisation showed that only 1.6 per cent of 2,200 oil fields surveyed by them will have negative cash flow even at $40. Marginal cost of shale oil production in Permian Basin in the US is only about $20. With such low marginal cost, oil supplies might not have responded as expected by Saudi Arabia when they decided to maintain their market share and allow the market to set the prices.Still, it cannot be ruled out that some of the oil exporting countries including Saudi Arabia may decide to control production not being able to manage with low oil prices. The greatest uncertainty is the possible disruption in oil supplies in politically unstable countries like Iraq, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, and Venezuela. There is also some probability, depending upon how normalcy may come to the first three countries, that oil production in those countries can easily add three million barrels per day (mmbd).However, it is more than likely that the OPEC decision to maintain market share has an impact on medium term oil supplies. Just about every oil company has reduced exploration and production budget which is bound to reduce non-OPEC production in the medium term.Supply, demand uncertaintiesHowever, on demand side, there will be positive results as a result of fall in oil prices. OPEC is forecasting oil consumption to increase by 1.2 mmbd to reach 92.3 mmbd in 2015. The current production spare capacity according to IEA is around 3.4 mmbd. With all the uncertainties of supply and demand, and relatively small spare capacity, oil market can easily turn around should there be any oil disruption which we cannot foresee today.It is quite likely that when oil prices start increasing again (which is more than likely in the next few years), it may easily go above $100. Some even suggest as high a price as $200. At that time, if India continues to subsidise residential LPG like today, the subsidy burden may exceed Rs 1,00,000 crore per year.If the NDA government is interested in helping the poor by improving education, providing other welfare measures like subsidised quality power, water supply and health facilities, then it needs all the funds it can save by limiting subsidy to the middle class and poor. LPG sector subsidy is one such to tap into provided there is political will.The best time to eliminate subsidy for any commodity is when consumers do not suffer much when that commodity is liberalised. LPG subsidy per cylinder has fallen from a high of around Rs 480 per cylinder to the current low level of Rs 113. Instead of eliminating the subsidy in one step, it can be done over a period of six or 12 months, as they did in the case of diesel, to minimise the hardships on the consumers. Of course, the poor can continue to be assisted through direct subsidy through Aadhaar system to prevent any leakage.If the NDA government waits long and oil prices increase, which is more than likely, then it would have lost a golden opportunity of helping the poor by eliminating LPG subsidy."

The production cost was around Rs 600 per quintal. What can I do? I have to sell it in the open market."" ""For a small farmer like me, where will I get money to keep the potato in the cold storage? I can't wait for months to make profit. I will be losing around Rs 2 lakh if the government agencies do not purchase potato from us,"" said Pal, who had grown two hectares of potato. The experience of cultivators in Ganjam district in south Odisha is no different. Kalu Sahu of Digapahandi block has produced 256 quintals of potato. But, he has kept the produce in his home and is waiting for private traders to purchase it. ""I am not interested to keep the potato at the cold storage in Berhampur. The production cost of potato per kilo is Rs 5. The transportation cost to the cold storage is Rs 2 per kilo and the retail price in the market is Rs 8 a kilo. I am ready to sell it with a thin profit margin,"" he said. Deputy director, horticulture, Omprkash Rath said: ""In the current season, potato was grown on 930 hectares in Balasore district. A hectare's yield is around 120 to 150 quintals and an investment of about Rs 80,000 has been made per hectare."" Notwithstanding the fact that the state had been facing shortages of potato during off season and was dependant on neighbouring states, there seemed to be lack of co-ordination between the agriculture and co-operation departments. The state government had launched the Potato Mission on December 27 to make the state self-reliant in tuber production. Notwithstanding the fact that the state had been facing shortages of potato during off season and was dependant on neighbouring states, there seemed to be lack of co-ordination between the agriculture and co-operation departments. The state government had launched the Potato Mission on December 27 to make the state self-reliant in tuber production. The state was to purchase potato from farmers to maintain a buffer stock of 10 lakh metric tonnes this year. Last year, the state had produced around two lakh metric tonnes as against the requirement of 11 lakh metric tonnes. Following an uproar in the Assembly, Speaker Niranjan Pujari held an all-party meeting, and it was decided that three ministers - agriculture, co-operation and civil supplies - will have a separate meeting to ensure proper co-ordination among their departments. Earlier, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy had said his ""department has nothing to with procurement of potato. We ensured that potato cultivation is taken up in a big way"". He claimed National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Limited was to purchase potato from 22 districts and Odisha State Co-operative Marketing Federation Limited from seven districts. These two organisations function under the co-operation department. Co-operation minister Damodar Rout, on the other hand said: ""I am not aware of this decision. Did agriculture minister ever tell me that we should make arrangements for the procurement?"" The statements of two ministers came after both the BJD and Opposition members had raised the issue. Even the Congress members trooped into the Well, demanding a direction to the government. BJD member Ranendra Pratap Swain said distress sale of potato made a mockery of the government decision to launch the Potato Mission. Jaleswar MLA Ashwinee Patra said: ""The farmers are selling their produce to traders from outside at throw away prices as government agencies are not purchasing the tuber."" The Speaker had to adjourn the House twice and call an all-party meeting to break the impasse. Additional reporting by Sibdas Kundu in Balasore and Sunil Patnaik in Berhampur"
73,Potato keeps House on boil,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Potato-keeps-House-on-boil/articleshow/46672718.cms,2015-03-24,The Times Of India,"BHUBANESWAR: The humble tuber united both treasury and opposition members in the assembly on Monday. They created an impasse over distress sale of potato. An all-party meeting convened by speaker Niranjan Pujari ended inconclusive. Agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy and cooperation minister Damodar rout passed the buck on each other for the farmers' plight.Raising the issue during zero hour, Athagarh MLA Ranendra Pratap Swain (BJD) said the state government's failure to ensure potato sale has resulted in their rotting. Smelling a conspiracy, Swain sought a statement from the government. Claiming that though potato was being sold at Rs 3 to Rs 4 a kg against the minimum support price of Rs 6, Swain said though the government had fixed a procurement target of 29,000 metric tonne (MT) for this year, it had lifted only 2,000 MT. Leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra described the situation as 'very serious' and sought a ruling from the speaker before allowing further business in the House. ""The government must find a solution. The ministers must reply,"" he said.As Congress members raised anti-government slogans and tried to climb onto the speaker's podium, Pujari adjourned the House twice, first from 12.15pm to 12.50pm and then from 12.50pm to 3pm.A meeting chaired by the speaker and attended by agriculture minister, cooperation minister, parliamentary affairs minister Bikram Keshari Arukh, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Das Burma, Leader of opposition and BJP legislature party leader Basanta Panda could not arrive at a solution. The ministers would meet again on Tuesday.Outside the assembly, the agriculture minister said he had done his duty to maximize tuber production. ""Ensuring its sale was not my job. The cooperation department should ensure procurement by agencies like Markfed and Nafed,"" Maharathy said.Agriculture minister said, ""Did the agriculture minister inform me to create marketing arrangement for the extra production?""The leader of opposition said the ministers' response to the situation show lack of coordination among various government departments. ""If the government does not come out with a strategy by Tuesday morning to lift all the potato, we will step up protest,"" Narasingha said."
74,Odisha govt to buy potato at Rs 6 a kilo,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150325/jsp/odisha/story_10653.jsp,2015-03-25,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, March 24: The government today started procuring potato from farmers at Rs 6 a kilo following an uproar over distress sale of the crop in the state between Rs 3 and Rs 3.50 a kg. The Opposition had threatened to paralyse the ongoing budget session of the Assembly if the problem of potato farmers was not addressed immediately. ""The Odisha State Cooperative Marketing Federation Limited (Markfed) has started procurement in Bargarh, Jharsuguda and Balasore districts from today. It will be taken up in other areas soon,"" said cooperation minister Damodar Rout. Udyan Fresh outlets, which operate under the horticulture department, and Markfed will procure potato in 11 districts that have produced an estimated 6,600 metric tonnes of the crop this year. Markfed will purchase 5,500 metric tonnes and Udyan Fresh the remaining 1,100 metric tonnes. The decision to procure potato was announced after three ministers - co-operative minister Damodar Rout, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy and civil supplies minister Sanjay Das Burma - met to ensure proper co-ordination among the three departments. Incidentally, the state had a bumper harvest this year following the government's decision to launch a potato mission on December 27 to encourage production. The state had decided to keep a buffer stock as it had experienced severe scarcity of potato last year with the retail price touching Rs 60 per kg. Last year, around 2.4 lakh metric tonnes of potato was produced in the state against the requirement of 11 lakh metric tonnes. This year, the yield has gone up to 3.12 lakh metric tonne, due to incentives announced by the government. This year, the state has for the first time declared minimum support price for procurement of potato in order to keep buffer stock. The minimum support price has been pegged at Rs 600 per quintal. The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited (Nafed) was entrusted with purchasing potato from 22 districts and Markfed from seven other districts. However, Nafed withdrew from the procurement operation from March 18, said official sources. Civil supplies minister Sanjay Kumar Das Burma hoped that the potato crisis would be over within 48 hours. ""We have sought status report from the district collectors and asked them to speed up procurement operation,"" he said. Official sources said the lack of adequate cold storage had been a major bottleneck for potato conservation and production. The state has only six functional cold storages running under the cooperation department and another 12 are lying defunct. ""Steps are being taken to revive these defunct units. Hope they will be ready by the coming year,"" said Rout."
75,Veggie prices go up 60% from mandi to retail cart,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Veggie-prices-go-up-60-from-mandi-to-retail-cart/articleshow/46683483.cms,2015-03-25,The Times Of India,"Prices of vegetables and pulses are spiralling upwards relentlessly, despite a bountiful winter crop. Onions, tomatoes, peas, and cabbage are costlier by more than 50% compared to last year, while brinjal and cauliflower prices have shot up by up to 40%. These figures are based on the average of prices in 30 cities collected by the National Horticulture Board (NHB).In several cities, prices are higher than average. In Jaipur, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, tomatoes are selling at Rs 30-Rs 40 per kg, over 100% more than last year's price. In Chennai, Jaipur, Shimla and Thiruvananthapuram, onions are priced at over Rs 30 per kg, almost 70% more than last year. In Bhubaneshwar, Mumbai, Chennai and Ahmedabad, cauliflower is selling at over Rs30 per kg, almost twice the price last year.Meanwhile, prices of already costly pulses have climbed up further by up to 25% in the past year, going by data collected from 68 cities and towns by the consumer affairs department. Moong has touched Rs100 per kg while turarhar and urad have crossed Rs 80 per kg.The question harried families are asking is why do prices of these crucial food items keep soaring, and what is the government doing about it.The position of the government, articulated by finance minister Arun Jaitley in Lok Sabha while replying to the Budget debate, is that inflation is under control.Experts offer differing views on the subject. ""Vegetable prices have gone up in some parts of the country while they have crashed in other parts. For example, potato and onion prices have come down.This is due to the rigidities in the market system,"" said Saumitra Chaudhuri, former plan panel member, and called for an urgent overhaul of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) laws.But Chaudhuri's assertion that vegetable prices have crashed in some parts of India is not validated by data. And APMC laws were overhauled nine months ago. It had been declared ""vegetables, fruits and other perishable commodities, which are price sensitive, will be removed from the ambit of the APMC Act. It was also declared that ""in the interim, States will exempt these perishable commodities from the APMC yard taxes local fees, if any, to provide some relief on pricing"". Onion was also declared an essential commodity to check hoarding.Despite this overhaul, prices of vegetables have continued to rise. So, is there a demand-supply mismatch? Production data doesn't seem to indicate that. Total vegetable production zoomed up by 84% between 2001-02 and 201314. The area under vegetable cultivation has increased by nearly 50% since 2001, and yields have also gone up. Production of fruits rose by 107% and spices by 57%. In pulses, there is a definite gap between the annual consumption need of about 22-23 million tons and production of about 18-19 million tons. But that is made up by duty-free imports of about 3-3.5 million tons every year.In vegetables, the crucial issue appears to be the supply chain from the farmer to the consumer. The average difference in wholesale and retail prices ranges between 40% and 60%. Note that this margin is largely within cities where wholesale markets are located. It does not count transport costs from the farm to the wholesale market.In certain cases, there is clear evidence of cartelization of traders -they act in tandem to hold back produce and jack up prices artificially.This is most pronounced in onions where production is largely concentrated in certain districts of Maharashtra and Karnataka. In 2012, a study by the Competition Commission of India had nailed this conspiracy of onion traders in the Nashik region.""The perishable nature of fruits and vegetables causes bigger spikes in prices whenever there is a small shortfall in output. To stabilize these prices the government will have to build value chains, more cold storages and food processing facilities, "" says Ashok Gulati, agriculture expert at ICRIER. While this techno-fix will take time and may not work for many vegetables given their low storage potential, the aam aadmi continues to pay through his nose.(With inputs from Surojit Gupta)"
76,Court unhappy with govt potato measures,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150325/jsp/bengal/story_10718.jsp,2015-03-25,Telegraph,"Calcutta, March 25: Calcutta High Court today expressed displeasure at the measures initiated by the Mamata Banerjee government to ease the problems of potato farmers. ""The steps the government has taken will help traders, transporters and industrialists. It has failed to solve the growers' crisis,"" Chief Justice Manjula Chellur said after going through the affidavit. In response to an earlier order of the court, the government today filed an affidavit mentioning the initiatives it had taken to help the farmers tide over the crisis of falling potato prices because of excess production. In the affidavit submitted to the division bench of Chief Justice Chellur and Justice Joymalya Bagchi, the government mentioned that it had decided to give subsidy to traders so that they feel encouraged to export potatoes to other states and countries. The government said it had also decided to procure 50,000 tonnes of potatoes directly from the farmers at Rs 5.50 a kg. Hearing a PIL filed by advocate Rabishankar Chatterjee seeking the court's intervention to solve the potato crisis farmers were facing, the court made some suggestions. The chief justice asked additional advocate-general Lakshmi Gupta: ""Why is your government not constituting farmers' co-operatives and activating kisan mandis?"" The additional advocate-general did not make any promises on the proposals. In states such as Gujarat, there are farmers' co-operatives that get in touch with bulk buyers to help the farmers sell their produce directly to them through contract farming agreements. ""The issue of activating kisan mandis is also the need of the hour. In several states such as Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, potatoes are graded by using machines after these are brought to the mandis. There is always a demand for graded potatoes,"" a Bengal agriculture department official said. The court today asked the government to submit on Friday a concrete proposal for setting up an expert committee to solve the problems. The court said the committee should include agriculture, trade and marketing experts. ""Secretaries and joint secretaries are not needed to be kept in the committee,"" the court said. The case will come up for hearing on Friday. Two potato growers committed suicide in Birbhum and West Midnapore yesterday, raising the number of such deaths to 11 over two weeks."

78,Potato glut and price slump drive 8 farmers to commit suicide in Bengal,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Potato-glut-and-price-slump-drive-8-farmers-to-commit-suicide-in-Bengal/articleshow/46696274.cms,2015-03-26,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: A potato glut and plunging prices have triggered suicides in Bengal's Hooghly, Burdwan and Bankura districts. Hooghly alone reported six of them. Prices have crashed, one kg of the tuber selling for Rs 3 to Rs 4. With the pressure unlikely to ease in the near future, peasants face an uncertain future and are agitating.In 2013, Bengal's farmers reaped a good harvest of 85 lakh tonnes and raked in handsome profits. But prices across the country were volatile because the crop failed in UP, largest producer of potatoes. Bengal, the second largest producer, could have stepped in and eased matters out.But chief minister Mamata Banerjee stopped trucks from her state from ferrying potatoes to neighbouring states to stabilise prices in the deficient areas. She was wary that shipping out the crop from her state would create a scarcity in Bengal. Rates remained stable in and around Kolkata but soared past Rs 35 a kilo in states like Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and elsewhere. Nevertheless, the Bengal farmer reaped a profitable harvest that year.Encouraged by that experience and dreaming of making good money, Bengal farmers sowed potato over more than 4 lakh hectares of land this time around. Production was bountiful, an impressive 1 crore-plus tonnes. The state's 435 cold storages capable of storing a maximum of 62 lakh tonnes overflowed. Sacks of potato lay out in the open exposed to the forces of nature, farmers tried to stock some at home. Soon, the rot began setting in.The neighbouring states, wary after the bitter 2013 experience with Bengal, meanwhile stepped up potato production. Yields in Odisha, Bihar Assam, and other states improved, consequently demand for Bengal potatoes slumped.""In 2013, the government stopped us from selling our produce outside. We were forced to cancel contracts with prospective buyers in other states. This time around, those buyers simply refused to look to Bengal to pick up consignments. They signed deals with growers and sup growers and suppliers in other states,"" Lalu Mukherjee, an office-bearer of the Bengal Potato Traders' Association complained.""The cost of farming potato isn't being realized. Traders from Jharkhand, Assam, Andhra Pradesh are not contacting us anymore. Last year we could not supply them as per our contract with them, as our government banned the inter-state movement of the crop. Assam government has announced subsidy for potato farming. Punjab and UP too have bumper crop, reducing overall demand,"" Mukherjee said.Saddled with large stocks of unsold potato, farmers are in big trouble. Shanti Das of Burdwan's Simlon village says he's distressed. ""We take bank loans to buy seeds and other farm inputs. How do we repay these loans? I had these loans? I had to sell my produce dirt cheap, at Rs 3 a kg. The losses were huge."" Das has still managed to survive despite the terrible downturn, but many others simply haven't been able to withstand the shock. They've committed suicide.Most Bengal farmers, unlike UP and Punjab, have small, marginal holdings. Average potato farmers here own two-to-five bigha plots and they must rely either on agriculture cooperatives or local lenders for funds. The per bigha cost of potato is between Rs 18,000 to Rs 21,000.Laxmirani Das's husband Tapan was one such tiller. This Arambagh farmer committed suicide last Sunday.""My husband cultivated 2 bighas on lease basis. He had borrowed Rs 40,000 but found no buyer for his crop. His yield was only worth Rs 8,000 and he mortgaged my ornaments. Lenders knocked on our door every day. The insult was unbearable. Nobody helped us. My husband was forced to commit suicide. No one from government has come to us.""The state government, though, refuses to accept most of these peasant deaths as cases of suicide. ""These deaths resulted from family feuds,"" Becharam Manna, state agriculture minister recently said. The refusal to acknowledge the suicides can well be attributed to political exigency. Panchayat votes are around the corner, as are elections to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.But the government's steadfast refusal to address the fast-building crisis has only proved counterproductive. The anger among farmers is rising and on Sunday Singur farmers held a protest outside Minister Manna's residence at Ratanpur demanding immediate government intervention.Later Manna said: ""Last year, government fixed the price of potato to arrest the price hike. But this year, we are encouraging farmers to trade with other states. But other states are not very happy with the potato quality.""The Mamata government insists it'll make arrangements to buy up unsold potato stocks. It also permitted exports, but countries like Russia have refused to buy citing quality reasons.Meanwhile, middlemen have sensed an opportunity to cash in on the Bengal potato glut. Reports from many places say they mopped up the crop dirt cheap for Rs 3 to Rs 4 a kg, although the retail prices in Kolkata continued to hover around Rs 10 a kg. The CM's agriculture adviser Pradip Majumdar said he was conscious of the middlemen problem: ""We've formed a number of farmers' clubs. These would now supply potato to big departmental stores,"" he said.This assurance has come way too late, says Shanti Das.""It would have made sense to sign the contract with Pepsico. They provide seeds and inputs. But the condition is we must sell at a pre-determined rate. We have thus far been avoiding companies like Pepsico, hoping to sell at higher rates. But this time around, our gamble has seriously bombed. Next season, I'll probably tie up with Pepsico.""Shyamal Dhara of Kotulpur, Bankura agreed: ""Last year we had a bumper profit. This year, we borrowed money and farmed on our own. We did not get into contract with Pepsico. But for next season, we've gone with it. The queue of farmers before Pepsico office grows every day."""

The centre will become functional by year-end.Disclosing this on Sunday, an official spokesman of the state agriculture department said the centre would showcase added value of mechanism and management practices. He said latest technology agronomics would be used to meet the emerging need of virus-free and certified seed potato.The spokesman said the centre would also come with techniques of post-harvest handling and storage with latest storage and monitoring systems to improve shelflife of the produce. He said the trained task force would help farmers as per standardised Dutch technology by stakeholders in the potato chain.He said with the adoption of the proposed technologies, potatoes would be saved from 16 kinds of viruses, enhance shelflife of different varieties and seed would be produced in air instead of soil which would be further germinated and hardened in net houses."

Accordingly, the states will %set up a revolving fund %and the Union and state governments will contribute to it equally. The fund is being planned so that requirements for all future interventions can be decided and met with at the state-level %itself. The central agencies will, however, set up their %revolving fund entirely %with advance payment from the Centre,"" a government official said.""Procurement of the commodities will be taken up directly from farmers or their organisations at farm gates or mandis and made available at a more reasonable price to consumers. Initially, the fund has been proposed to be used for onions and %potatoes only. Losses incurred, if any, in the operations will be shared between the Centre and the states. Profits will also be shared in the same ratio at the time of settlement of funds with the Central Corpus Fund,"" the official added.The scheme will be implemented for the next two financial years, 2015-16 and 2016-17. Its implementation may be continued after that as well.The fund will be managed by a Price Stabilization Fund Management Committee (PSFMC) under the chairmanship of the secretary of agriculture department (Government of India).Money under interest-free loans from the Centre to the state governments based on their first proposal will be released subject to prior setting up of a corpus account by the states. The state governments will designate a nodal administrative department for the scheme. The PSFMC will invite, appraise and approve proposals received from the state and central Agencies. It will also approve the amount to be disbursed under the loans and meet regularly to review the wholesale and retail prices of commodities. The panel will also provide guidance or propose required interventions.For procurement by central agencies such as National Agriculture Co-operative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), they will jointly prepare a detailed prescriptive manual in a time-bound manner with the help of the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF). The manual will detail quantity and quality parameters and all precautions necessary for every operation at each stage of procurement and distribution.The summer crop, harvested in March and April every year, has a shelf life of six to seven months. It is stored in the market till the arrival of the kharif crop, which usually begins by mid-September. The kharif and late kharif crops have a shelf life of only a month. So, only the summer crop is stored by farmers with a hope of getting a better price for the commodity.Former NAFED director Changdeo Holkar told TOI, ""Apart from Maharashtra, no other state has storage facilities. Instead of the state governments, the Centre should give the sole responsibility of the fund to NAFED, which has a network across the country and also has storage facilities. The state governments would not be able to implement the scheme on their own.""Agricultural activist Giridhar Patil said, ""Currently, priices of agricultural commodities are decided by traders, not farmers. The price fluctuation is not natural, but artificial because it is manipulated. Commodities such as onions are not an exception. Moreover, governments would not purchase the commodities at higher rates. The price stability fund will not benefit farmers. Agricultural experts should be appointed to implement the scheme."""

Sanatan Biswas, 26, was found hanging in a bamboo grove behind his house at Jashordanga in Alipurduar II block this morning. He and his elder brother, Haradhan Biswas, had taken a loan of Rs 30,000 from a neighbour to cultivate potatoes on two bighas of land taken on lease. ""My brother Sanatan had taken Rs 30,000 from a local moneylender for potato cultivation in January as they were known to each other. I and my brother together cultivated potato on two bighas of land taken on lease. For the past few days, Sanatan was upset as the moneylender had been asking for repayment. My brother even stopped taking food. When we got up this morning, Sanatan was not found on his bed. We searched the entire area and saw him hanging in the bamboo grove behind our house,"" said Haradhan. According to Haradhan, they were giving a monthly interest of Rs 900 to the moneylender. ""Sanatan was feeling the pressure as it was he who took the loan. He told the moneylender that the debts would be cleared in a few days,"" said Haradhan. ""But we were not in a position to repay the money as potato was sold at a lower rate. We sold out the yield from the two-bigha plot for Rs 9,500.

They are putting their produce in cold stores and plan to sell it when the prices move up as potato rates in the area have dropped by two-thirds since mid-February.Bathinda district has 35 cold stores with a storage capacity of nearly 30 lakh bags of 50kg each. There are 20 cold stores in Rampura area with each having the capacity to hold 70,000 to 125,000 bags. Cold store owners are charging Rs 70 to 80 per bag for stocking potato for six months till October.Farmer Amrik Singh is busy in heaping up potatoes in his fields spread over 30 acres at nearby Kararwala village. Some workers are assisting him in filling the tuber in gunny bags. Despite getting good yield, he is worried about storage of the crop due to sharp decline in potato prices. He is not in a hurry to sell the produce and is looking for a cold store to stock his produce.Bathinda chief agriculture officer Rajinder Singh said that potato was sown in nearly 20,000 acres in the district and farmers had got an average yield of above 1,000 tonnes per acre. Average yield of potato in the district was 900 tonnes per acre last season, he added.Higher yield coupled with lower supply to other states has caused a glut of potatoes in the local wholesale market and prices have crashed to nearly Rs 2-2.5 per kg from more than Rs 6 per kg last month.""Though I am happy to get more yield, the biggest problem for me is to store the potato. I will have to put the crop in the cold storage and pay up to Rs 80 per bag. I don't know when I will be able to sell it,"" said Amrik.Nehiawala village's Chamkaur Singh, who had sown potato in 11 acres, is waiting to store his crop as well. He said, ""Potato produce this year is turning out to be a nightmare. I am sitting outside a cold store for over 24 hours and will have to shell out much money to stock the crop there.""Cold stores in Bathinda district are flooded with queries from potato growers. Farmers are worried as due to bumper crop, the cold stores don't have enough capacity to hold all the produce sent by them.""Potato from Punjab is sent to Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, but the supply is less this year. With lower supply and higher yield, potato prices have crashed. Therefore farmers are preferring to store it instead of selling at such lower rates,"" said Bathinda grain and vegetable market association patron Mohinder Kumar Narula."

Phoring Ghosh consumed the pesticide at his home in Golghar Ghoshpara village of Gajole around 11pm. He was taken to the primary health centre where doctors pronounced the 52-year-old dead, police said. Ghosh's family said the farmer could manage to sell the produce at Rs 110 a quintal, which works out to Rs 1.10 a kg. It takes a farmer approximately Rs 4 to produce a kilogram of potato. According to Dilip, Ghosh's elder son, his father had grown potato on 5.5 bighas. ""He was hopeful of a good crop and had borrowed around Rs 80,000 from two local moneylenders. He had a good crop and the production was around 225 quintals. Last year, potato had sold for Rs 780 per quintal in the open market and our father thought that he would be able to repay his debts and would have enough profit to carry out some repairs to our house,"" Dilip said. ""However, this year, the price has hit rock bottom.... For the past few days, he was depressed and last night, we found him lying on the floor writhing in agony. He had consumed pesticide. We rushed him to the health centre but he could not be saved,"" the son said. Golghar Ghoshpara is 25km from Malda town. Sasanka Mondal, Ghosh's neighbour and Congress gram panchayat pradhan of the area, said there were other potato farmers who had been similarly affected. ""Phoring is not alone. He has committed suicide as he could not recover his production cost. There are other potato farmers in our village facing a similar situation. The state government has failed to protect the farmers. On the one hand, the farmers are not getting a proper price, and on the other, the government is not increasing the capacity of cold storages,"" Mondal said. Ujjwal Saha, the secretary of the Malda Merchants Chamber of Commerce, criticised the state government. ""The potato farmers are not being able to recover their production cost. There is also no mechanism in place in the district so that the government can procure the potatoes from the growers,"" Saha said. Malda district magistrate Sharad Dwivedi said he had asked the local administration to submit a report to him. ""I have heard that a potato farmer has committed suicide in Gajole. I have asked the block development officer to submit a report to me in 24 hours,"" Dwivedi said."
87,BJP potato team runs into Trinamul protest,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150330/jsp/bengal/story_11644.jsp,2015-03-30,Telegraph,"The BJP team surrounded by Trinamul supporters in Tarakeswar. Picture by Ananda Das Hooghly, March 29: A BJP team that had gone to meet potato farmers in several places of Hooghly today ran into protests by Trinamul supporters at least thrice and the leaders were forced to walk for around 200 metres when their vehicles were surrounded during one of the visits. Sources said BJP national secretary and Bengal minder Sidharth Nath Singh was pushed around and heckled by the Trinamul supporters when he tried to walk through a blockade along with other team members at Ramnarainpur, on the outskirts of Tarakeswar. Police intervened and made way for the delegation. Party MP S.S. Ahluwalia, state BJP president Rahul Sinha, MLA Samik Bhattacharya, actress-turned politician Locket Chatterjee and other state leaders had accompanied Singh. ""We wanted to hear out the problems of the farmers and offer them solutions,"" Singh said. In Singur, which the team visited first, the farmers alleged that purchase tokens were being distributed at the local government markets only among those who were loyal to the ruling party. Farmer Manik Das said they were getting as low as Rs 180-Rs 200 for a 50kg sack of potatoes. Sources said producing a sack of the crop required at least Rs 200. A section of the farmers urged the BJP team to bring back the Tatas and other investors, saying agriculture was no longer flourishing. Ahluwalia was heard telling the farmers: ""Don't worry, Tata and the others will all come back."" Singh, however, said the state government needed to create an atmosphere for industry to flourish. At Bottola in Nalikul, about 25km away on the route to Tarakeswar, the BJP team was greeted with ""go back"" slogans. Trinamul supporters carrying party flags said the BJP team's visit would be of no use. The team heard out some of the farmers, who complained about not getting a good price for their crop. ""I don't know how to repay my debts,"" a farmer said. The potato crisis in the state has been compounded of late by a number of suicides across the state. In over two weeks, at least 13 suicides have been reported over potato prices. State BJP president Rahul Sinha, who was also told to go back by the protesters when he intervened, said: ""The ruling party supporters are not allowing us to stand by the troubled farmers. But we are determined. We shall go ahead, come what may."" At Ramnarainpur, around 200 Trinamul activists led by the party's Tarakeswar committee chairman, Swapan Samanta, blocked the BJP convoy of 10 vehicles. Posters saying the team's visit was just a ""political exercise"" and demanding central government subsidy on fertiliser prices were held aloft. When the protesters refused to budge, the BJP leaders got out of their vehicles and demanded that they be allowed to go through. Singh, Ahluwalia, Sinha and Bhattacharya then walked through the protesters, who continued shouting slogans and waving Trinamul flags. ""Where is the district SP?"" Singh shouted, as Ahluwalia held up a letter sent to the police two days ago seeking protection for the team's visit. The police stepped in after a few minutes and made way for the team to pass through. In the melee, Singh and some of the other leaders were pushed and heckled. The farmers, most of whom were Trinamul supporters, kept alleging that the team's visit was futile. ""Their coming here serves no purpose,"" said Samanta. ""Not a single potato farmer will benefit from this. We blocked their way to point this out to them. Some BJP leaders had to jostle to make way. It wasn't intentional."" The team would prepare a report on their visit today and submit it at the BJP national executive meeting to be held in Bangalore on April 3-4, sources said, adding that the potato crisis would be raised in Parliament and the Bengal Assembly. Singh had yesterday held the Mamata Banerjee government responsible for the potato growers' plight, claiming that the farmers in Bengal could have been given relief had the chief minister initiated steps as had been done in states such as Haryana. In a statement, Singh had said the problem of surplus potato production could have been handled properly had the Bengal government taken the Centre's help. BJP leaders had also pointed out several loopholes like government intervention in the market over the past two years, absence of farmers' co-operatives to deal with the bulk buyers and the rigid stance on contract farming as other major reasons behind the farmers' plights. Later this evening, the BJP team members told a news conference the only immediate action that the Centre could be asked to take was the prompt release of the promised Rs 1,500 crore rural job funds to the state. ""If the state government is quick in disbursing the money, potato farmers in Hooghly and Burdwan can at least pay off their debts. Several of them are still to get payments for the 100 days' work they have done 18 months ago,"" Singh said."

So far, 17 potato farmers suicides have been reported in Bengal.In 2013, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had imposed restrictions on export of potato to other States to curb its rising price in Bengal, which continued for one-and-a-half years. These restrictions were however eased last year.Encouraged by the profit gained from potato farming last year, farmers had sown potato in more than 4 lakh hectares of land.The chairperson of the Pradeshik Krishak Sabha, the peasant wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Madan Ghosh said that the West Bengal Governments decision to restrict the export of potato to neighbouring States left them with no choice but to increase their own yield of potato.As a result, traders from other States lost interest in importing potato from West Bengal and our farmers lost an essential means to sell their crop, he told The Hindu here on Sunday.Mr. Ghosh said that the potato production this year had crossed 1 crore tonne compared to the normal yield of 90 lakh tonne. So the State governments decision to purchase 50,000 metric tonne directly from farmers is grossly inadequate, he said, adding the States cold storages maximum capacity was only 65 lakh tonne.Speaking in the same vein, professor of Economics and Rural Development in Vidyasagar University Sebak Kumar Jana said that the decision to ban export of potato was not financially logical. If there was adequate infrastructure to set up more cold storages, such a loss to farmers could have been avoided, he added.Professor of Economics at Jadavpur University Joyashree Roy, however, said that to associate potato farmers suicide directly the with low price of the crop would be scientifically justified.Mr. Basu, however said that the restriction on potato export was imposed to prevent large-scale shortage of the crop in Bengal as it was illegally exported to Uttar Pradesh, which had low crop production in 2013. So, it was a positive step by the State Government that prevented the acute shortage of potato in West Bengal, he told The Hindu .Mr. Basu said that some dishonest potato traders were also responsible for the present crisis as they were not buying potatoes from farmers to pressurise the State Government for their vested interests.The restriction was imposed to prevent shortage of the crop in Bengal as it was illegally exported to U.P.Purnendu BasuBengal Agriculture Minister"

Besides, hailstorms were reported at a few places over Haryana on Monday afternoon.While the Centre would calculate the fresh damage to crops only after reports come in from the states, agriculture ministry sources informally estimated that between 10 and 20 lakh hectares could be affected. This is on top of 105 lakh hectares that have been impacted since March 1.In Gonda district of western Uttar Pradesh, two farmers died after visiting their wheat fields following the rains. They were identified as Yashpal Singh, 55, and Ram Gopal Das, 56. SDM Dharmendra Singh denied that the deaths were linked to spoiled crops. ""The farmers were suffering from health issues and succumbed to heart attack,"" he said.The Bharatiya Kisan Union said farmers were getting just Rs 50 for a 50-kilo packet of potatoes  one-fifth of the earlier rate  because of fears that the produce may have rotted due to the rains.Haryana, meanwhile, has reduced its wheat procurement target to 65 lakh tonnes from an earlier 75 lakh tonnes in view of the untimely rain and hailstorms in March, a spokesman for the food and supplies department said. State additional chief secretary Dhanpat Singh said he had received reports of damage to crops in the past 24 hours, particularly from Sirsa district.Farmers said the current spell of untimely rains and winds were harmful for wheat which was about to be harvested in few days. It may also delay harvesting by a few days. Grain formation in wheat had already taken place and rains could cause discolouration, which would affect quality.Jitendra Kumar, a farmer from Nawabganj block in UP, told TOI that waterlogging due to rains was a major concern because a majority of crops had almost matured. ""Farmers who sowed potatoes and oil seeds will be the worst-hit by recent rainfall as it will increase chances of damaging the crops further,"" he said.While wheat, oilseeds, cotton and vegetables are likely to be hit by the rains, farmers cultivating pulses such as moong, urad and lobia, along with fruit crops like guava and mango are likely to benefit, said H S Kushwaha, senior meteorologist at G B Pant University, Pant Nagar."

In spite of such violence, none of our candidates have withdrawn. Overall, we expect to receive 80 to 82 per cent of votes in the civic polls, he said.Alleging that the TMC was manipulating the State Election Commission to their own benefit, Dr. Mishra said the TMC was the prime enemy of the States democracy.While we wont indulge in any form of violence, we wont remain silent if the ruling party attacks us. If the TMC thinks we will not protest, they are living in fools paradise, Dr. Mishra said.The Trinamool Congress Government is yet to acknowledge potato farmers suicide, Dr. Mishra said.A total of 19 farmers committed suicide in March.

92,"Stabilising price, a welcome move",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/469396/stabilising-price-welcome-move.html,2015-04-02,Deccan Herald,"April 03, 2015, DHNS: 0:45 ISTThe Union agricultural ministrys decision to set up a price stabilisation fund is intended to check wild volatility in the prices of farm commodities. This was announced in the July 2014 Union Budget by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. What the government has done now is to operationalise the decision and issue guidelines for the utilisation of the fund. It has been set up with a corpus of Rs 500 crore and will be used to facilitate market interventions for managing prices of perishable agricultural and horticultural commodities. In the beginning, it will be used for onion and potato which are the most common among perishable commodities. Later, more commodities may be covered. Such a mechanism is needed more for perishable commodities because there will be severe losses which cannot be made up for if the right price management steps are not taken in time. In the case of some perishable commodities the time window for action may be just a few days. The lack of preservation facilities like cold storages makes the need for market intervention urgent in most situations.Prices of agricultural commodities are vulnerable to large fluctuations due to factors like unpredictable weather, vagaries of production, problems in transportation and practices like hoarding by middle men. When the prices go down to unremunerative levels, it affects farmers whose livelihood depends on them. When they go up, they hit the budgets of consumers. In both cases, large numbers of people are affected and so there is the need to keep the prices stable at least over the short and medium terms. The proposed mechanism involves both the Centre and the states. The fund will be used to enable state governments and central agencies to launch operations like procurement and distribution of commodities when needed. The procurement will be done directly from the farmers at farm gate prices and the distribution will be made at reasonable prices to consumers through official outlets. This can ensure that there is no distress sale on one side and profiteering on the other.Setting up such a mechanism is not enough to ensure price stability. Operations by the government machinery and official agencies are not known to be efficient. Their responses in crisis situations are not always prompt. So, the usefulness of the price stabilisation fund will largely depend on how well it is utilised. More funds may be needed and more commodities will have to be covered in future. It should also be noted that market interventions are only one part of the strategy to keep prices of agricultural commodities stable."

Untimely rain already has damaged 5 to 7% of the crop in the region.At the time of sowing, potato had price that had shot up to Rs 1,600 per quintal, encouraging farmers to increase the crop acreage. To their disappointment, the price now has plummeted to Rs 200 per quintal in the selling season. The farmers of Jalandhar and Kapurthala, who export potato to Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, are left searching for buyers this year.Their soaring expectations led to surplus production in the region. The demand is nowhere near supply and theres not enough space in the cold storages to hold all this harvested potato. The farmers are desperate to sell the crops for any price. So far, I have sold only about 5% of total potato harvested from 350 acres, for just `500 per quintal. Nobodys is willing to buy the rest for even `200 per quintal, said Kapurthala farmer Kuldeep Singh.Last year, the farmers had not enough to meet the market demand, and when they increased the acreage, now dealers arent interested. Potato price nosedived over the past two months after the government put a ban on exporting the vegetable to other countries to control food inflation. It only helped create a glut.Along with the price of potato, the cost of its seed was also at its peak at the time of sowing. Farmer Jaswant Singh had to pay `1,700 for a 50-kilogram bag of seeds then. All the inputs such as seed, irrigation, labour, pesticides, and fuel would together not have cost less than `80,000 per acre, he said. He grew potato on about 150 acres. If I harvested 100 quintals of potato from 1 acre, Ill make only `20,000 on the market, and my minimum loss will be `55,000 per acre. If we keep our harvest in cold storage, the cost per acre will jump to `1 lakh, and our loss to `75,000 per acre, he said.Traders bluffing?Potato trader Hardeep Singh said as the production was surplus even in the other states, the buying cycle had been disturbed. If there are no buyers, why will the dealers stock the crop to rot in the cold storages? he said. However, horticulture development officer Sukhdip Singh Hundal said even with all the overproduction in Punjab this year, the price should not have declined so steeply.It seems that dealers are not buying the crop deliberately, to force farmers to sell the crop for a lesser price, the officer analysed."

Picture by Gopal Krishna Reddy Berhampur, April 2: Efforts have been initiated for revival of the Berhampur Multipurpose Co-operative Cold Storage at Ambapua. The cold storage, constructed 29 years ago, is the only one in Ganjam district managed by the co-operation department. It has been lying defunct since the past 14 years. Deputy registrar of co-operative societies (Berhampur division) Raghab Rao said this cold storage, commissioned in 1986 with a storage capacity of 2,000 metric tonnes, had an accumulated loss of Rs 44.65 lakh against total asset of Rs 41.09 lakh and total liability of Rs 85.74 lakh. ""Over Rs 2, 92 lakh is outstanding towards electricity dues from December 2001,"" said Rao. In 2000, it had been leased out for a period of five years to a private operator, who abandoned the unit after one year as it failed to manage it properly. Again in 2010, it had been leased out to another private trader for a period of 12 years from November 3, 2010 - which also failed to run the unit on the plea of not getting bank loan. ""I have advised the managing director of the cold storage to rescind the lease agreement,"" said Rao. Deputy director, horticulture, Bhagaban Dash said there was a potential for potato cultivation at Jagannathprasad, Hinjili and other blocks in Ganjam district in large scale. ""If the cold storage is revived, this will definitely motivate the farmers to cultivate potato in large scale, and this, in turn, would help in stability of price,"" said Dash. About 2,000 farmers produced more than 1,000 metric tonnes of potato in Ganjam district this year. ""But, we are having only one active cold storage at Aska Road with a capacity of 5,000 metric tonnes - which is managed privately,"" said the deputy director. ""Vegetables, which are grown abundantly in this district more than the demand, should be preserved in the cold storage managed by the co-operation department at a reasonable rate,"" said Pramod Rath a farmer having more than 50 acres of cultivable land. The vegetables, not grown in the district, can also be brought from outside and preserved here to meet the consumers' requirements. ""Thus the producers can get fair price of their yield, and it will also tackle distress sale of any commodity,"" he said."

The farmers had faced huge losses and dumped potatoes on the roads to mark their protest against poor marketing then.The potato crisis is severe in the state this year too. Besides dip in prices in the market, there is acute shortage of space in cold storages across the state. Moreover, ban on export of potatoes in international markets, mainly in Russia and Europe, by central government has also doubled the troubles of the farmers.Even chief minister Parkash Singh Badal has directed the agriculture department to look into 'potato crisis'.""I have personally asked agriculture minister Tota Singh to make immediate plans to provide relief to farmers,"" Badal said during on his visit to Patiala on Wednesday.As per available information, Punjab produced 22.32 lakh tonne of potatoes this season, against 21.89 lakh tonne last year. The prices of potatoes have come down to rs 200-215 per quintal from Rs 1500-1600 per quintal last year.When contacted Tota Singh said the problem was mainly caused due to surplus production of potatoes in other states mainly Gujarat and West Bengal.""Though both these state have planned freight subsidies for transporting the crop to southern states, but we can't implement the same model since the production takes four to five days to reach states in the South; and the threat of damage is more in that case,"" he said.He added that the farmers have shown their reluctance to go with such model due to uncertainty of sale in the open market in southern states.""I have also discussed the matter with chief minister over phone and informed him about the situation. We have also directed senior officials of the department to consult potato growers associations for immediate viable solutions,"" Singh added.History frighten farmersWhile the past three years have been productive for potato growers, the scars of 2000 and 2011 when potato flooded the market, are giving the farmers a scare.In 2000, over 25,000 quintals were dumped and farmers were forced to sell their crop at Rs 1 per kg. The same happened in 2011, when Punjab produced 21,000 lakh tones of potatoes."

Untimely rains have taken toll of main rabi crops such as wheat, oilseeds, pulses and vegetables and fruits. Vegetables like tomatoes, cauliflower and coriander have been the worst affected.Horticulture crops such as mangoes, bananas, grapes, channa have also been affected and the impact could be seen in their prices. Releasing the study titled 'Monsoon 2015: Agri-business Risk or Opportunity,' conducted by Assocham and Skymet DS Rawat, secretary general Assocham said, ""in addition to the untimely rains, temperatures have also gone down and this could affect the crops and consumers may have to face the burden in the next few days with prices of vegetables likely to increase by 20-25%.""""The production of Rabi crop would be down in the 25-30% minimum range as more wet weather was in the offing in April and the damage to the Rabi crop would continue"" highlighted the Assocham-Skymet study. ""This untimely rain would also increase the threat from pests. If this continues, farmers may face huge monetary loss,"" said Mr. Rawat.As per the government estimates, country's foodgrain production is expected to decline by 3.2% to 257.07 million tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July to June) from the record 265.57 million tonnes in 2013-14. However, some pockets that might be deficient (by a narrow margin) include Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Marathwada, Rayalseema, South Interior Karnataka, North Tamil Nadu and parts of the North East.Rawat further said, the standing rabi crop like wheat, mustard, potato and gram have been damaged in parts of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. More than 20 districts have faced the brunt of heavy rain on their crops as output is likely to be adversely affected. The mandi arrivals will face delay along with deterioration of quality thus resulting in possible price rise of essential food items, added Rawat."

It only adds to the woes of the farmers who are already battling crop losses caused by untimely rain and hailstorm.Although the Akali Dal-BJP government has assured full support to growers, farmers have threatened to throw crop on road, a repeat of 2011 incident when growers dumped potatoes on road in Jalandhar.Last summer, growers had got Rs.20 to 22 per kg when retail prices soared, forcing the Centre to impose stock holding limit on potato crop.We want from the government to fix MSP for potato as being fixed for wheat and paddy crops so that growers are assured of minimum prices to avert such kind of situation, potato grower Sukhjit Singh Bhatti said.Farmers this season are suffering heavy losses because of prices plummeted to lowest level as there is a surplus crop across the country including West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Mr. Bhatti said.Cold storage owners are also refusing to store the crop, anticipating that farmers would not pick crop in the wake of lesser prices.Where farmers will keep their crop as they are not finding place in cold storages as well.

101,Crocodile tears: Parties must walk their talk on farmers by pushing agricultural reform,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/crocodile-tears-parties-must-walk-their-talk-on-farmers-by-pushing-agricultural-reform/,2015-04-08,The Times Of India,"Food prices have assumed a life of their own since December, trending upwards even as price levels in other areas dip. This discordant note will influence the entire economy as any subsequent reduction in interest rates by RBI, the regulator entrusted with maintaining price stability, will be influenced by trends in food inflation. And after the damage wrought by unseasonal rainfall over the last five weeks, theres cause for anxiety as well as enough of a warning to governments.Agriculture reform needs urgent attention. Any more pussyfooting will be harmful as lack of attention to agriculture will ripple across the entire economy. The stock line of political parties in India is that their heart bleeds for farmers. The truth is they couldnt care less  look at the way agricultural progress has been stymied by warped policies and held hostage to vested interests among traders. The result of warped policy is that farmers are forced to operate in artificially fragmented markets and left to deal with entrenched monopolies of traders in agricultural markets. To make matters worse, public investment in agricultural infrastructure has been replaced by subsidies riding on inefficient delivery mechanisms. It shouldnt surprise anyone, therefore, that there is anxiety today about another wave of large-scale rural distress.West Bengal, whose chief minister Mamata Banerjee claims to be a friend of farmers, is symptomatic of the problem. Whimsical bans on inter-state movement of agricultural produce such as potatoes have ended up killing even traditional markets for the states farmers. To compound the problem an inexplicable dislike of organized retail  that would enable backend infrastructure, economies of scale and sharing of risks  makes it impossible for farmers to get a better deal. The impact of such counterproductive policies gets magnified in years of adverse climatic conditions.To begin with NDA needs to reorient its spending priorities in agriculture to step up investments in irrigation, which will have a bigger impact on farming than the current poorly targeted subsidy programme. This needs to be complemented by states dismantling farm trade barriers. Both farmers and consumers lose on account of fragmentation as we swing between shortages and gluts. And unless new technology and stakeholders enter agriculture, impetus for change wont be there. Instead of shedding crocodile tears, its time for political parties to walk their talk on farmers."

The crop lies flattened, the golden kernels turning black. As the 38-year-old farmer steps into his field at Chaumuhan, barely 2km off NH 2, his feet sink into two-inch deep slush. Four days after a severe hailstorm pummelled the district, his farm, like countless others in this block, remains waterlogged.""There's nothing left to harvest. It'll take 10 days for the field to dry,"" says Kaptan with a vacant expression. ""Ghar mein bachche khana maangte hain. Mann karta hai is khet mein hi jaan de doon (My children demand food. I feel like killing myself right here in this field)."" Friday's hailstorm was the latest in a series of tragedies that have made Mathura district one of the ground zeroes of farm distress . It started with a drought last monsoon  when Mathura received 42% rain  hitting paddy output. Golden basmati prices dropped to around a third of the previous year due to export restrictions, compounding the losses.Then in February came the freak rains. ""The downpour first spoilt a lot of the potato crop that was almost ready for harvest. Prices of the water-soaked vegetable sank to Rs 100-150 per sack whereas it earlier sold for Rs 1,000. Many farmers have left the crop in the field to cut losses,"" says potato grower Pramod Singh.Despite the rains, farmers had banked on returns from wheat, the main Rabi crop sown this year in 1.64 lakh hectares of the district's 2.54 lakh hectares of farmland.The hailstorm buried that hope. ""The first rains bent the crop. We still believed the harvest wouldn't be affected. More showers followed, accompanied by high winds. The stalks started touching the ground. The hail was the killer blow. The crop is flattened and the wheat heads lie wet in the ground,"" says Rajbir Singh, who owns 20 acres at Chaumuhan, all filled with destroyed wheat.The unseasonal rain has been unrelenting. District agriculture department official Rakesh Babu said Mathura received 55mm rain in March, more than 11 times the normal 5.4mm. ""Around 18mm more has fallen in the first six days of April, almost four times the month's average of 5mm,"" says Babu.Rajbir demonstrates the effect of the sustained wet weather. He takes wheat kernels and rubs them with both hands. Pointing to the shrivelled grain in his hands, he says: ""This grain is so light it'll go with the chaff while threshing. The rains first bloated the grain, which burst out of the kernel and got exposed to the sun, and shrivelled.""It's the same story in most villages of block Chaumuhan, which literally means four-headed  an allusion to Brahma  and boasts of having one of only two Brahma temples in the country.Barring the rare fields sown very late in the season  where the wheat is more or less intact  farmers were trying to salvage whatever was left of the crop. ""A farmer lives on hope. But much of the wheat that can be harvested wouldn't be fit to eat,"" says 66-year-old Keshav Dev, former Pradhan of Pilhora village.""We've declared the district's wheat crop to be more than 50% affected,"" says Mathura DM Rajesh Kumar. ""We're seeking a compensation of Rs 331 crore. Half of this will come from the Centre on the basis of relief of Rs 9,000 per hectare, which the state would equally match.""With PM Modi announcing an enhanced compensation package on Wednesday, Mathura farmers are now eligible for Rs 13,500 per hectare from the Centre. On the DM's orders, revenue officials are in villages, taking down farmers' bank account numbers and listing those who don't have accounts.But farmers remain sceptical about relief reaching them. ""After last season's drought, there was talk of compensation. None came our way. In 2006, the last time a hailstorm destroyed crops here, a compensation of Rs 3,000 per hectare was announced. We got Rs 1,000,"" says Rajbir.A couple of kilometres away towards Vrindavan, Mathura MP Hema Malini stares out of hoardings, striking a dance pose with her daughters. These are promos for Hema's brainchild, Braj Mahostav, a cultural extravaganza featuring Bollywood stars. The festival was scheduled for April 11-12, but has been put off following farmer protests after last week's hailstorm. On Tuesday, she toured her constituency to assess the damage.Farmers have been sounding the alarm over another looming crises  a shortage of fodder for livestock. ""The fodder comes from the wheat stem. With much of the crop destroyed, I fear fodder would soon be selling for Rs 10 per kg,"" says Keshav Dev, pointing to a stack of rotten wheat stalk."
103,Troublesome landing,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150409/jsp/opinion/story_13429.jsp,2015-04-09,Telegraph,"Singur, the potato bowl of Bengal, appears to have landed in trouble again. Not on account of unwilling farmers grieving over their lost assets, but on account of overproduction by the ones who didn't lose their land. Excess supply of the crop has pulled down prices, leading indebted farmers to slither down the precipice. According to media reports, matters have come to a dismal pass, with a section of the farmers demanding that the Tatas be recalled to help rectify the situation. Industrialization, presumably rapid, will bring along with it employment for the farmers, thereby leading them out of misery. Simultaneously, the Central government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure the passage of the land bill. What with its minority status in the Rajya Sabha, it is relying now on repeat promulgations of ordinances, till presumably, a joint session of Parliament will beget the act itself, the promised blueprint for industrial bliss. Unleashing the forces of industrialization is believed to be the sine qua non for economic growth, an adored goal for governments across our planet. Growth increases output and growth creates employment, as the recent Singur message appears to suggest. In his radio broadcast, the prime minister, too, has assured a job for each land-losing family, over and above the compensation offered for acquired land. Availability of land, of course, is an essential precondition for building factories. It is a basic factor of production along with labour and capital utilized by industry. Of these three, though, land enjoys a unique position in that while the other factors can grow, land cannot. Widespread industrialization makes land increasingly scarce vis--vis other factors of production, leading to a rise in its market price in the vicinity of industry. Let us concentrate, however, on the nature of technology associated with growth. As every budding undergraduate student of economics is aware, extra doses of capital and labour, applied to a fixed plot of land, cause aggregate output from an enterprise to rise, but the incremental output brought about by the extra labour and capital begins to fall eventually. Elementary text-books refer to this as the law of diminishing returns. Put somewhat dramatically, a banyan tree cannot be grown in a flower pot, unless it is cultivated as a bonsai. A sustained rate of growth of per capita aggregate output will call, then, for forces that can negate the tendency for diminishing returns to capital and labour as they are applied to non-augmentable land. Quite obviously, the forces in question will assume the form of technological upgrades that will improve the productivity of capital as well as labour. However, a rapid rise in labour productivity may not necessarily be a phenomenon that acts in the interest of the labouring class as a whole, for it implies that any given volume of output will require a smaller workforce to produce it. The labour required by the industrial sector could nonetheless rise over time, provided, of course, that the size of the manufactured produce itself grows at a high enough rate to engage not only more productive labourers, but also a larger number of them. Indeed, this is the way employment in China's industrial sector behaved from 2003 till 2012, during which period the number of workers engaged in industry expanded from 159.27 million to 232.41 million. These figures translate to 21.6 per cent and 30.3 per cent of the total workforce for China. As opposed to this, India employed 24.7 per cent of its workers in industry in 2012, while in agriculture it had engaged 47.2 per cent of the workforce. The land ordinance or act is aimed at reducing the size of the agricultural workforce through allocation of land to industry. Even if the land reallocation goal is achievable, what is not clear is how the displaced agricultural workers will be rehabilitated as industrial workers. There are at least two issues that need to be borne in mind in this context. First, India's land area is approximately 2.97 million square kilometres as opposed to China's much higher 9.33 million sq km. Further, India's population density is around 421 persons per sq km as opposed to China's approximate density of 145. In other words, not only does China have more land available in absolute terms to be distributed in favour of industry, it is also likely to displace fewer people in the process relative to India. In comparison with China, the law of diminishing returns is likely to work with a vengeance in India therefore, to counter which India needs massive access to productivity improving technology. And this, as already pointed out, does not send a cheerful message to the agricultural land owners. More productive industrial workers will probably give rise to greater, not less, unemployment in the workforce, especially for those displaced from agriculture. A second issue that needs to be emphasized is that employment generation in the industrial sector is not merely a technological phenomenon. Industry does not produce output unless it can be sold. And the market for Indian goods is no longer restricted to its geographical boundaries. The country's open economy policies are gathering pace and this means that it is rapidly transforming into one amongst the many producers catering to world demand. Its producers have to compete with foreigners for a rising chunk of the world market, and this too when the world market itself has been in doldrums for the last few years. Even China is showing signs of a slowdown, in spite of a political structure that allows workers to be woken up in the middle of the night to attend to lucrative export orders. Whether India can harness the forces of technological advancement in industrial production and compete in world markets is yet to be seen. But even if it is successful in its endeavour, we are likely to be caught in a Scylla and Charybdis paradox, namely, needing to compete in a weak world market on the one hand and preventing unemployment from rearing its head at home on the other. The implication of technical progress for employment may easily be gauged from the performance of India's service sector, which produced 56.27 per cent of the gross domestic product in 2012 by employing 28.1 per cent of the workforce. China's share of services by contrast was 44.6 per cent and its employment share of the workforce was 36.1 per cent. It is no secret that India has a giant lead over China in services and the secret of our success lies in labour saving technological innovations. Exactly the reverse situation prevailed in Indian industry in 2012, where 24.7 per cent of the workforce produced 26.21 per cent of the GDP. China on the other hand utilized 30.3 per cent of the workers to turn out its 45.3 per cent of the industrial share. It is not entirely clear, therefore, that the magic of competitive growth in industry can be achieved through a simultaneous increase in employment of land and labour, even though the media reported the government to have made precisely this claim following the re-promulgation of the ordinance. If the assertion turns true, what is almost certain to happen is a growth in the ranks of the unorganized labour force working in the fringes of industry in townships surrounding industries. Since land acquired for industrial use cannot keep pace with the growth in industrial capital and output, a steep rise in the price of land in the neighbourhood of industry can hardly come as a surprise. This had happened in Singur before the Tatas took the curtain call. As Mark Twain had famously observed, the best way to get rich was to buy land, since people didn't produce it anymore. Some people out there are awaiting a bumper harvest therefore. Not of potatoes anymore, needless to say. The author is former professor of economics, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta"

The State has also announced support a slew of measures for potato farmers, who have seen a bumper harvest this year so that the glut does not affect their incomes.Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said the change in norms for input subsidy would benefit a large number of farmers. He, however, urged the Centre to further enhance the relief norms for the affected farmers to Rs. 10,000 per acre.As for the potato farmers, Mr. Badal said with the State witnessing record produce of 22.60 lakh metric tonnes during the current season, it was essential that the growers get a fair price for their crop in the market.Hence, he said Markfed has been directed to procure potatoes from the market for supplying to other parts of the country. Mr. Badal also announced that a freight subsidy of Rs.200 per quintal would be paid through Markfed for export of potatoes to other countries and Rs. 50 per quintal for selling or sending potatoes to other States.To help the farmers at the Mandi Board level, he said the Market fee and Rural Development Fee has been slashed from 2 per cent to 0.25 per cent till April 30, 2015, to facilitate higher sales. Similarly, a commission of only 1 per cent would be charged by the commission agents during this period.The Government has also decided to increase use of potatoes in the mid-day meal that is supplied to 16 lakh school students across the State on a daily basis."

Crop damage due to inclement weather, especially to wheat, has caused distress among farmers in large parts of Haryana and Punjab, which are the biggest contributors of foodgrains to Union government's buffer stock.Untimely rains coupled with hailstorm and high velocity winds have put paid to the farmers' chances of harvesting a bumper wheat crop, which is the biggest rabi crop in both Punjab and Haryana. Beleaguered farmers are now looking up to the government for financial assistance in the wake of damage to their crops, which could result into fall in yield and also affect the quality, which could hit their chances of selling their produce at better rates.TOI takes a look at the problems faced by farmers in the region due to bad weather.AMRITSAR""Life is going to be tougher now. I will not be able to pay off my debts this time for sure. Not only will the commission agent demand his money back, he will also charge higher rate of interest,"" farmer Nishan Singh of Neshta village in Amritsar district told TOI on Wednesday.Farmer and sarpanch of Karnala village, Surjit Kumar said, ""More than 30% of wheat and fodder crops have been destroyed. And, it is still raining. This means more losses in the offing. Farmers who are tenants or sharecroppers are very much depressed and worried. They are being pressurized by owners to vacate the fields so that they can give those on contract to others. But the crop has not been harvested as yet. The prevailing weather conditions will not only delay wheat harvest but also result in late sowing of paddy and other kharif crops.""A resident of Mahal village, Sukhdev Singh said, ""I had to defer plans to construct another room in my house. Let alone a room, I fear it will be difficult to survive if the government does not help us.""SIRSAA farmer and sarpanch of Vaidwala village in Sirsa, Avatar Singh, said, ""We were hoping to reap a bumper crop this time, but unseasonal rain and hailstorm have washed out all our hopes. Farmers for whom crops are their mainstay are now looking up to the government for financial assistance for survival.""Didar Singh from Rania claimed, ""I was thinking of paying back all my debts after harvesting wheat. However, the situation has changed drastically after untimely rains. I will have to take another Rs 1 lakh (loan) to meet the expenses of my family members.""Deepak Kumar, from Jhorar Nali village, said, ""A farmer has to invest more than Rs 15,000 to cultivate wheat crop for every acre of land. I have two acres and have spent more than Rs 35,000 to cultivate wheat. I came to know that after special assessment, government will pay only Rs 10,000 per acre. How will we be able to meet our daily needs?""Bhupinder Virk of Rania said, ""Following heavy rains, we are spending more than Rs 1,500 per day to pump out water from our fields.

More than 70% of wheat has been ruined due to the rains while potato got damaged completely due to inclement weather. I have ploughed potato crop in the field as it decayed before the harvest could begin.""KURUKSHETRA""Due to unseasonal rain, there has been huge damage to mustard and wheat crops. First of all it has huge impact on the production. Apart from this, quality of grain will be very poor this year,"" said farmer Gopal Singh from Amin village of Kurukshetra.Pawan of Umari village said, ""Damage due to bad weather will reduce the production of mustard to one-fourth. Earlier, we would get around eight quintals of mustard per acre and now it will be hardly between 2-3 quintals per acre.""YAMUNANAGAR""Our problems have not ended with the crop damaged due to rain and hailstorm.

Pathankot deputy commissioner Sukhwinder Singh put the figure at around 4,025 hectares till April 5. Tarn Taran and Amritsar deputy commissioners are yet to receive the details about loss to crops in their districts.POTATO GROWERS REEL UNDER BAD WEATHER, WEAK MARKETUntimely rains and glut of potato crop has added to the woes of growers, who are either forced into distress or are storing the tuber in cold stores to sell later when rates look up.Compared to Rs 800-900 per quintal that the farmers had fetched during the last season, this time potato growers are selling their crop at not more than Rs 300-350 per quintal. Apart from weak demand in the market due to over supply, potato crop has also been damaged by rain and hailstorm.""I have sold around 50% my crop at Rs 200 per bag. Each gunny bag contains 50kg potatoes. But I couldn't fetch even Rs 150 per bag for the crop which was damaged due to rains. We don't know the reasons behind the glut. Traders in the market say it is due to surplus production,"" said Kuljit Singh of Bakhopeer village near Bhawanigarh town of Sangrur.Manjit Singh of Beenaherhi village near Nabha town of Patiala district, ""You can estimate our losses from the fact that I have sold the second last stock of my crop at Rs 160 per quintal in the market. Nobody is ready to purchase potato. At least 30% of the total crop was damaged by rains.""He added that due to declining rates, he was left with no other option but to store 500 bags of potato in a cold store by Rs 90 per bag for six months.

The Trinamool Congress procession skipped the stalled Tata project site at Beraberi and the other important flashpoints of the 2006 anti-land acquisition movement - Beraberi, Gopalnagar and Khaserbheri. Many of those who lost their farmlands to the Tata small car factory live in these localities.The turnout at the demonstration was impressive and the show was dominated mostly by the 16 panchayat pradhans and some land losers who subsequently went on to win gram panchayat polls or landed lucrative government jobs.Some key faces in Mamata's stormy 2006 movement such as Becharam Manna, Ratan Ghosh and Shaila Ghosh and many farmers who were then the Trinamool chief's lieutenants in Singur were nowhere to be seen at the protest.""At the end of the day, we got nothing. We didn't get our land back. We were the key organizers against the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government's land acquisition at Singur. Today, we live with a sense of loss. The party gave us nothing. We did not get our land back,"" said one such land loser who skipped Wednesday's march.But Paramita Das, from Beraberi village, sounded satisfied. She had joined Mamata in her 26-day fast against the Tata project. Das is today a panchayat Samity member. ""The villagers get a monthly dole comprising 16 kg rice and Rs 2,000 each. And, among those who get this assistance are former day labourers at the project site,"" she said.Ram Chanda Das, another daily wager, said: ""More than 1500 day labourers like me joined the march. The centre didn't released fund for 100 days' work. Things are really bad now after the prices of potatoes crashed. The situation was so bad that we were forced to sell our produce dirt cheap to middlemen. Didi is our saviour. We survive on the dole she gives.""With the civic and rural polls nearing, Wednesday's protest was a showcase event where she projected the land losers to gain traction among the village folk here.But the sense of loss among those who had brought Mamata to Singur in 2006 was profound. The key leaders of that movement said they were worse off now. With their land gone, they are forced to survive on the government dole. Many barely subsist on selling milk and with no real assistance from the political forces they once backed they say they've been left high and dry. The likes of Manna, Ratan and Shaila were once big landholders. Today, they rue the fact that they get the same treatment as day labourers and have to live on a dole."

But he did not get the right price. He could sell only 150 sacks at prices varying between Rs 90 and Rs 150 per bag. He had taken a loan of Rs 10,000 for buying fertilisers and pesticides,"" said Saheb's elder brother Sunil.According to Sunil, Saheb had hoped to make up for the losses by selling the boro paddy. But the hailstorm on Sunday destroyed most of the paddy. He had taken a loan of Rs 25,000 to buy fertilisers and pesticides to cultivate the crop.""My brother was very depressed when he went to see the boro crop in the field yesterday. In the evening, he took pesticide and killed himself at home. By the time we could take him to Burdwan Medical College Hospital, he had died.

Claims are fixed on the results of such experiments.""Since the entire process will take time, the government has instructed companies to extend 25 per cent of the claims immediately as farmers are eligible for this amount under the modified National Insurance Scheme,"" an official said.Besides, banks have been asked to extend the loan repayment period for farmers in affected states. As per latest estimates, Rabi crops on 85 lakh hectares across 14 states have been damaged due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms during February 28-April 4.It has also been decided that the norms of National/State Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF/SDRF) will automatically be reviewed in April every year based on annual inflation derived from the Wholesale Price Index.These measures, including enhancement of financial assistance by 50 per cent in case of crop losses, have been carried out after revising the norms under NDRF/SDRF which came into effect from April 1.""However, a special dispensation has been made for farmers affected by hailstorms in different parts of the country during February-March and they will be given assistance under the new norms,"" the agriculture ministry said in a statement.Though the hike in compensation is meant for only up to 2 hectares under NDRF/SDRF norms, it still will benefit around 87 per cent of farmers. The latest agriculture census shows that the average land holding of farmers in the country is just 1.16 hectare. Nearly 67 per cent of farmers own less than one hectare whereas 22 per cent farmers own between one and two hectares.Meanwhile, in view of damage to onion and potato crops, agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh has written to all states including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal to purchase and maintain stocks of onion and potato under 'Market Intervention Scheme' as there is likelihood of increase in their prices in these states."

Farmers are forced to sell potato at around Rs 2 per kg, but consumers have been paying Rs 10 per kg for potatoes in the market. In this way, the middlemen are making more than the farmers.The huge difference of Rs 8 per kg has been only exposing the poor policies of the state and central government towards farmers.The Punjab government is encouraging farmers to adopt crop diversification to replace the wheat-paddy pattern and the potato crop is a major alternative to wheat, but right now, potato farming is turning a losing proposition for farmers.Potatoes were sold on Friday at the rate of Rs 80 to Rs 110 per 50 kg bag in the Bathinda market by farmers to commission agents and retailers. Besides, the price of potato for the consumer is still Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg. Harsimran Singh, a wholesale vegetable merchant, said that potato price rose on Friday, it had been sold only at Rs 38-40 per bag a few days earlier.The area under the crop and yield of the crop has increased here. The area increased to 6,000 hectares this year from 5,700 hectares during the last year and the yield has increased from 85-85 quintals to 113-120 quintals per acre.In Bathinda district, potatoes have been sown mainly in Rampura Phul and Goniana area. Farmers of these areas are complaining for low rates and lack of governmental subsidies and marketing policies.Gurcharan Singh, a potato farmer, said that he has been growing potato crop for the last twenty years, but now he is thinking to go back to the traditional paddy-wheat crops. He said, ""We had spent more than Rs 30,000 per acre on the crop and now we getting only Rs 18000 to Rs 25,000 per acre. How can we survive with this?""Buta Singh of Nahiya Wala village said, ""No cold store is free in the district to keep potatoes, as the wholesalers had booked the stores in advance. Cold store owners are demanding higher charges for storage. We are helpless to send our product to farther cities for storage. Merchants are robbing us.""In the market, 10% commission is charged from sellers, and the market fee is extra. The retail merchants are selling potatoes at the rate of Rs 8-10 per kg.The government did not fix any minimum support price (MSP) for the purchase of potato crop and no government agency bys the crop. Thus, farmers are facing huge economic losses, especially who produced potato crop for the first time."

Reminding the people of the promises made by the ruling Aam Aadmi Party in its election manifesto, Mr. Kejriwal said the government had fulfilled the promises of reducing electricity bills by half, providing 20,000 litres of free water to every household, issuing licences to e-rickshaws drivers and launching an anti-corruption helpline to make the Capital corruption-free.The Chief Minister said the Delhi Government had formulated a new plan to keep in check the prices of potatoes and onions, which were essential items, during the coming summer months.Mr. Kejriwal accused the Centre of releasing insufficient funds for the Capitals development, while affirming that the people of Delhi were paying Rs.65,000 crore annually in the form of taxes to the Union Government.In return, we get a paltry sum of Rs.325 crore a year. If we get Rs.10,000 crore annually, we will utilise the money for development of unauthorised colonies.The Delhi Government had identified six issues, namely water, sewerage, drains, roads, street lights and cleanliness of colonies as priority areas of infrastructure development, said the Chief Minister.The Chief Minister called upon the people not to fall prey to conspiracies being hatched to destabilise his government and slammed the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress governments for treating the residents of unauthorised colonies as vote banks.Several leaders of these parties have told me that if they fulfil all promises made to the people, there would be nothing left for the next elections, said Mr. Kejriwal."

It is us who are earning this money and giving it to Centre. We are demanding Rs 10,000 crore from them to develop your unauthorised colonies, Kejriwal said.He also urged the people to be on watch against any new construction in their neighbourhood.We promised everyone that no one will be homeless. We will not bulldoze homes. We will regularise unauthorised colonies and give flats to jhuggis, but it is your responsibility to see that in your neighbourhood no new home would come up and no jhuggi will come up.Otherwise nothing would be left for your children and mine in Delhi, he said.He claimed in 2008, Shiela Dikshit distributed provisional certificates but in the years after that no colony was regularised.The Congress lied. The BJP said colonies have been regularised. (But) registries are yet to be opened. They have used voters of these colonies as a vote bank.He said maps of four colonies will be ready and the people there can register their properties.Speaking on corruption, Kejriwal said people are threatening officials with mobile phones.

""Residents of unauthorized colonies have been living under the fear of the hammer and bulldozer. Your previous MLA used to threaten you with demolition and, hence, you voted for him. Now there is no need to be scared. All colonies are being surveyed for six facilities  include water, sewers, roads, drains, streetlights and sanitation  which the government will provide or improve, as need be,"" he said.Acknowledging that Delhi government is running low on funds and that regularization of more than 1,000 colonies would pose an enormous financial burden on the exchequer, Kejriwal said that the responsibility of so many residents was also that of the Centre which should increase Delhi's share from central taxes from Rs 325 crore to at least Rs 10,000 crore. Kejriwal has made this pitch earlier as well but for the first time has tied the demand for additional funds to a specific task.While promising houses for everyone, the CM added that no further setting up jhuggis or unauthorized colonies would be permitted as it would end up ""killing the city, leaving it with no resources"".The CM declared that the water situation during summer would be monitored by him, deputy CM Manish Sisodia and Delhi Jal Board vice chairman Kapil Mishra, who is also the MLA from the constituency. He also said that within a week the government would be announcing a special scheme to ensure that prices of potato and onion do not rise during summer.Sunday's event was slightly better attended than Saturday's rally at Mundka.

The stores will open in May and the farmers will try to hold on expecting a price rise which may lead the market to collapse in a few months after May, Patit Pawan Dey, president of West Bengal Cold Storage association told The Hindu .Rajesh K. Rana, principal scientist Central Potato Research Institute who visited the potato growing areas of south Bengal suggested that the farmers in the State should try to cover their cost of cultivation and other paid out expenses at the earliest.This year the farmers should not expect profits like but should be prompt in recovering their cost, he told The Hindu .According to him, while the production of potatoes this year has been 11 million tonnes the consumption of potato in the State throughout the year is about six to seven million tons.However, the farmers who complain of rising cost of production are hoping that by holding on to their produce they can reduce their losses.Gopal Pal, a farmer of Selimabad village of Bardhaman district who had cultivated potato in about 18 bighas of land said that he is also wary of what price he will get for his produce once the store reopens.Most of the farmers who cultivate potatoes take loan. They pay once the produce is sold. With lot of difficulty the potato has made to the stores and now if we are not able to break even it will be a disaster, he told The Hindu .During a visit to some of the families where potato farmers have committed suicide The Hindu found that distress is highest among those who have cultivated potato by taking land on lease from other farmers.Guddu Murmu, a share cropper from Chatimdanga village who was among the first to commit suicide in second week of March had leased out five bighas of land and cultivated potato.Similarly Atul Let, a farmer from Bishubati village in the same district who died on March 21 after consuming pesticides in the same district had cultivated potato on six bighas of land on lease.Steps to ease the distressFarmers and traders blame the Sate governments policy of not allowing potato out of State for the last two years that has resulted in the distress.When the price of tuber in the State crossed Rs. 20 a kg the State government banned movement of potatoes to States like Odisha and Jharkhand."

Loose sugar is selling for Rs 30 per kg while the finer packaged variety is available for Rs 34-35. Rates had reached an all-time high of Rs 40-45 in 2013-14.TOI had reported on Thursday how Maharashtra is likely to show record sugar output at 103 lakh tonne in 2015. Experts say imports from Brazil have also lowered rates.The surfeit has pleased consumers. At Lokhandwala Complex, prices have dropped from Rs 36 per kg to Rs 34. Housewife Neeta Nainani said, ""We were paying an exorbitant rate of Rs 40-45 per kg for sugar through 2013-14. Families are already burdened by the rising cost of cooking gas, pulses, edible oil and spices. So it is nice to see the price of one or two essential items reduce. Potato has also stabilized at Rs 12-15 per kg this year compared to the absurd Rs 25-30 of 2013-14.""At Apna Bazar's Mulund outlet, loose sugar is selling for Rs 30 per kg while ready packs of slightly refined quality are available for Rs 35, said salesman Ravindra Surve. In Pali Hill, Bandra, shopkeeper Sachin Mamniya of Vijay Stores is selling at the same rate.Mukesh Kuwadia, honorary secretary of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association, said wholesale rates had fallen by Rs 30 per quintal a fortnight ago but rose again by Rs 10-15 this week. ""Since 2014, the price per quintal (100 kg) has dropped to Rs, 2,750 from Rs 3,300. Local demand is low while exports are negligible. Brazil and Thailand are exporting large volumes at lower rates so Indian sugar is no longer viable internationally,"" he said."
121,Eggs on a roll in UP: Past decade saw 100% rise in egg consumption,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Eggs-on-a-roll-in-UP-Past-decade-saw-100-rise-in-egg-consumption/articleshow/46970063.cms,2015-04-18,The Times Of India,"LUCKNOW: The delicious egg-roll being sold at any eating joint down the line has beaten the panic created by avian flu. All thanks to the popularity of poultry products in the state which has broken all records in the past decade.Officials at state animal husbandry department in fact claim that the consumption of eggs in UP has registered over 100% growth in the past decade. ""The rise of eggitarians has been tremendous,"" said, Dr VK Sinha, chief of poultry unit at animal husbandry department, UP.Several statistics form the base of the conclusion drawn. One of them is per capita increase in production of eggs. Against 80 crore units in 2002-03, over 170 crore units of eggs are produced is UP as of now.The second indicator is rise in per capita per annum (or eggs consumed by one person in a year) consumption of eggs which has increased from eight in 2002-03, to 27 now. The third sign comes from integrated sample survey which has also shown a percentage increase of 100.95% between 2004-05 and 2013-14.Director, animal husbandry Dr Rudra Pratap attributes the trend to a shift from vegetarianism towards meat eating due to a number of reasons. ""Egg is a complete diet in itself. Besides nutrition, it rules a roost because of the convenience. Someone who cannot cook can also use it by boiling it or mixing it instant noodles,"" he said.Increased availability and low price is also a reason which gets strengthened by rising price of vegetables. ""There are times when buying a kilo of potato would be costlier than buying half a dozen eggs,"" stated Dr AU Qidwai, expert in poultry industry.""But demand has been a bigger factor than cost. Variety of menu, made after integrating eggs with popular food like rolls, parathas, pasta, noodles, has further fuelled the demand,"" he added.Officials however acknowledge that despite the increase, UP is far from the national average consumption of eggs which stands at 57 per person per year. It is also miles away from the recommended 180 eggs per person per year.They however said that the demand was speeding towards north. ""We import over 100 crore units of egg each year in wake of the demand,"" claimed Dr Sinha.Per capita consumption of eggs and chicken meat in UP over the yearsYear -- eggs in number2015 -- 272013 -- 22.52010 -- 202007 -- 182005 - 12(Source: poultry unit, department of animal husbandry, UP)1: There has been more than 100% rise in the number of eggitarians in UP.2: Experts attribute the trend to high demand, convenience and availability of eggs.3: Despite the increase, UP is far behind the national average 57 eggs.4: It is also below recommended Indian Nutritional Academy standards of 182 eggs per person per year.Chicken's in too: Not just eggs, the demand for chicken has also gone up. As per statistics, a person in UP consumes over 1400 grams of chicken meat every year which was about 350 grams a decade ago. This means that the average consumption of chicken per person per year has gone up by four times."

Payment of Rs 682 crore from the government was also awaited by farmers of Punjab, he claimed.Jakhar, himself a farmer from Abohar, resented that potato growers were forced to throw their produce on roadsides while Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy with site-seeing tour abroad. ""The gathering of farmers and farm workers today depicts the anguish of the people against the 10-month-old BJP-led NDA government which had been selling false dreams to grab power to benefit corporate sector,"" he said.Jakhar said that the Union ministry of food, public distribution and consumer affairs had directed the state government to not to grant bonus on wheat purchase as the Centre had dropped the decades-old practice of announcing bonus to bail out farming community which faced financial crisis due to non-remunerative prices of the produce.Bajwa claimed that thousands of farmers from Punjab gathered at Gurudwara Sri Majnu Ka Tila in New Delhi for the Vishal Khet Mazdoor rally. Other Senior Congress leaders like Lal Singh and Kewal Dhillon were also present at the rally."

""It is estimated that about 4.13 lakh potato growers have taken loans from commercial banks, regional-rural banks and cooperative banks. Considering much lower realisation of prices of potato causing economic hardship to farmers it is requested that crop loans should be waived by the commercial, RRB and cooperative banks in West Bengal. The finance minister may advise the financial banks and Nabard to initiate immediate steps in consultation with the state government to waive the loans and at the same advance fresh loans to them so that farmers may be able to prepare themselves for kharif crop,"" the letter said.Given the growing TMC-BJP political rivalry, Banerjee's letter to Jaitley could put BJP to test at a time when it is fighting TMC in the state that goes for assembly polls a year later."

This is highest in the past decade.According to the horticulture directorate, 109.15 lakh metric tonne potato has already reached the cold storages, which too, officials confirm, is a record. Officials at the horticultural directorate hope that the record production of potato this year would have a cascading effect on other crops and farmers alike which might keep a check on spiraling prices due to crop damage.Confirming the figure, horticulture director HP Joshi told TOI that the previous record was of 135.76 lakh metric tonne, achieved in 2010-2011. On the storage front, Joshi said, in the same year 100.42 lakh metric tonne potato has been stored which was the previous record. The reason for this bumper crop is conducive weather condition and increasing interest in farmers towards potato cultivation, another senior official said.There are 1,620 cold storages in the state with a capacity of 121.24 lakh metric tonne, Joshi said and added that the record production was projected by the Central Government agency National Centre for Crop Forecasting.Uttar Pradesh was the largest producer of potato in the country with the state accounting for around 35% to 40% of the total produce, Joshi said. This year, after UP, West Bengal is projected to produce approximately 100 lakh metric tonne potato, followed by Bihar.These states are not only the top three producers but also account for around 70% of total production in the country, Joshi said. In UP, around a dozen districts from West UP including Agra, Firozabad, Farrukhabad, Hathras, Kannauj, Aligarh, Mathura and Bulandshahar account for 40% of the state production.In Central and Eastern UP region, Barabanki is the only district with respectable potato production, Joshi said. Of the total produce in UP, around 6 lakh metric tonne is consumed by 21 crore UPites, Joshi said.Out of the total production of UP, around 10 lakh metric tonne goes to other states while around 17 lakh metric tonne is consumed as seed.

The Maharashtra government has reported that it provides a compensation of Rs.1 lakh to the family of those farmers who end their lives due to crop failure, debt and inability to repay loan.Meanwhile, CPI(M) member Ritabrata Banerjee disputed the governments reply on his question regarding suicide by potato growers in West Bengal. He said since March 21 potato growers had committed suicide in the State due to the steep fall in the price of potato. This had led the state to give incentives to growers such as market intervention and transport and export subsidy."

127,Riding trains in Delhi,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Dehati-Aadmi/riding-trains-in-delhi/,2015-04-26,The Times Of India,"A few days ago, Prime Minister of India rode a train, in this case the Airport Express, currently operated by the Delhi Metro. This was reported all over social media and might have become the lead report the next day, but very soon thereafter the Nepal earthquake took prime position.Here is one report on this event: PM Modi travels by Delhi MetroIt is another matter that the makers of Delhi Metros Airport Express in their ultimate intelligence did not consider it worth their while to connect their train line to the low-cost Terminal-1 of Delhi Airport. Nor did the operators of Delhi Airport think it worth their while to provide an inter-modal linkage to the two Indian Railway stations located on the Northern periphery of Delhi Airport at Palam and Shahbad Mohamedpur.Incidentally, decades ago when it was known as Air Force Station Palam, the Railway Station at Palam was directly connected. Thats how they got people and stores to the airport. Now, ofcourse, everything comes by road and causes huge traffic jams, but then thats what creates income for parking lots and increase sales of fuel.But then, our PM sees what is shown to him, lately.To get another look at Delhi trains, I spent Sunday morning riding trains in and around Delhi myself, Metro and suburban EMUs. Very different from the wonderful Airport Express trains, I must say.My first train was a Delhi Metro ride from Lajpat Nagar to Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. A short hop, from where I stood at a traffic light to catch a Rs 5 Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus for Hazarat Nizamuddin (NZM) Railway Station. I connected from the traffic light because there are no connecting buses to NZM from the Metro station.At NZM, the DTC bus stops about 500 metres away from the entry gates of the station, after which passengers have to walk through an obstacle course which does my maritime training proud. It is not just the pavements that have been encroached on or broken, but the water bodies that have sprung up as well as the open air latrines that abound, mainly because the only toilets around are now too expensive for most people to use.The ticket counter for general unreserved tickets is so filthy and the ticket windows so mud specked that I have a hard time seeing the people inside. The person issuing the ticket is also very surly, for some reason, and throws the ticket at me with rare disdain when I provide him with exact change, in this case Rs 10. I think many people selling tickets are unhappy that railway ticket prices have been rounded off.At the security check, I walk past because I have no baggage, and head for the island Platform 2/3 from where most trains going towards Delhi are listed. Once on the platform, I find a place to sit amidst the global house convention for flies that appears to be taking place, and a little baby crawls towards me, smiling at my obviously grandparently looks. I start writing down my notes in a little pad and ball-pen bought at a nearby stall for Rs 20 and sure enough, within 5 minutes, a representative of the law dressed in civvies walks up and asks me what I am doing.Who are you, I ask him. He says, I am CID in plains clothes. Really, I ask him. And he says, yes, and if you wish to re-confirm, we can walk across to the Police station. Something tells me he may not be pulling a fast one, so I show him my scribbles, he takes a look at them, looks at me, and asks me what I do, I tell him I write, and he says, oh, Ok, but be careful, dont make drawings of the railway station and lines.I sit it out for a few local trains coming from Palwal, Mathura, Ballabgarh, Kosi Kalan and one long distance train from Secunderabad, the Andhra Pradesh Express. From a distance, I can see the plains clothes guy watching me, fair enough.At the stall nearby, I spot something that interest me, the shopkeeper tries to take Rs 20 for it, saying Rs 5 is for the packing charge. I give him exactly Rs 15 and pick one up without saying a word.The same Indian Railways does catering for Parliament, it is said, where a full vegetarian thaali is available for 12/5o, Probably served in air-conditioned comfort with crockery and cutlery too?Another article on the subject says that the vegetarian thaali there costs Rs 29 and the Prime Minister had one some time ago.My vegetarian meal, on the other hand, is such a disappointment that I dont even want to insult puris by revealing them, not only are they stale but they also appear to have been made out of sawdust. The nutritious seasonal vegetable is potato mashed with salt and cooked in stale oil-I know what stale oil is all about because I have been mess committee on every ship I worked on.By this time, my friend from the CID is back again, and watching me take photos of the food. I present the packet to a family of 5 visibly poor people who had disembarked from the general compartment of the AP Express, when I see the joy on their face I buy them 9 more packets, and hop on to the next local train headed for New Delhi."

Brother Chhotulal said his elder siblings heart failed after three bighas of potato crop, sown with an investment of around Rs 80,000, was destroyed by rain. He was expecting a profit of Rs 2 lakh or so. He was in debt  over Rs 3 lakh. His daughter, Rekha, was to get married on April 30. He was banking on the winter crop to ease his financial burden. Rekhas wedding has been cancelled and we plan to the sell the three bighas to meet expenses because the state government hasnt paid any compensation, son Nand Bihari said.Manju Bai, the 30-year-old wife of a farmer in Kurad village, hanged herself on April 15 as their farmland of 12 bighas and sharecrop in 70 bighas was decimated by the freak weather. Husband Suresh Merotha said the loss would be over Rs 10 lakh. First we lost a good portion of our coriander crop to a bug infestation. Then, the hail pounded away the crop that survived the disease. My wife could not take the shock.Kota district collector Jogaram his hands were tied because disaster relief norms prescribe compensation of Rs 3 lakh each to the next of kin of those killed by rain, lightning and other natural calamities. But there is no provision for relief for deaths from shock or suicide. Nevertheless, the district administration has sought a list of such farmers. A decision will be taken after going through the list.Until then, the wait continues for the grieving families."

The prices reached up to Rs. 35 per kg as the production here saw a downward trend in November and December, burning holes in the pockets of the consumers.Trader say with the record production of 1.2 lakh metric tonnes this season in West Bengal, potato price is hovering around Rs. 4 per kg in the wholesale market there. Heavy loads of potatoes from that State is reaching the markets here everyday.Sale of potatoes has gone up significantly in the current marriage season.

Cabbage, bitter gourds are available at Rs.40 per kg at OBS market and the Rythu Bazaars here.According to market sources, the prices will remain stable throughout the year, if vegetable cultivation gets encouragement from the government. Now, vegetables are grown in less than 3,000 hectares in the district.Marketing remains a major concern , since we are selling vegetables almost at half of the prices when compared to that of markets.

But it is costlier by at least by Rs 20 in other parts of the City, he said.Rajamma, another vendor at KR Market, said: The produce the market gets from other states is not affected greatly. Only the produce coming from Andhra Pradesh has come down. Thats why the price has changed a bit.While retail vendors and supermarkets have mango priced at not less than Rs 70 a kilo, the prices of even alphonso, the costliest among the mangoes is just around Rs 50-60 at KR Market, as against Rs 150 in supermarkets.Farmers also have incurred losses due to unseasonal rain.Shivanapura Ramesh, an agriculturalist from Devanahalli whose crops were damaged by hailstorms, said it is the merchants who have benefited from both sides. They have been purchasing produce at a lower price from farmers and selling them at a higher price by creating artificial scarcity.They tell us such vegetables do not find customers, and force us to sell them at throwaway prices, while on the other hand they fleece buyers by saying there is scarcity of vegetables."

He purchased kidney beans from a local store in Amritsar and went home and sowed it.When the crop was harvested in May last he got a yield of around eight quintals from an acre and sold it in the local market at a cost of Rs 70-Rs 90 per kg. The crop gave me more money than wheat, he told HT.Randhawa is a vegetable grower and he often sows wheat in January after harvesting potato crop. He kept the rajmah experiment a closely guarded secret last year. This time, he approached PAU experts, who did not encourage him. An encouraging voice came from chief agriculture officer (CAO) Balwinder Singh Chhina and from Gurdip Singh, the CAOs junior officer.This year, in the last week of January, Randhawa again sowed rajmah and he increased the acreage. The crop is ready for harvesting next month and this time he is expecting a yield of 10 quintals per acre. Though the crop suffered some damage due to untimely rain, he added.I hope to save around Rs 40,000-Rs 50,000 from an acre from this crop, which I would not have in the case of wheat. I will get a rate of Rs 80-Rs 90 per kg in the market.When Punjab agriculture director MS Sandhu was informed that the state had a rajmah grower, he visited Manawala on Sunday to see the crop and so did a PAU team. Sandhu confirmed that Randhawa was the first successful farmer in Punjab who grew rajmah at this level."

Prakash Kammaradi, chairman of the Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission here on Monday at a press conference, after holding a meeting with district-level officials.The Area under millets and jowar cultivation was on the decline in Karnataka in the last 10 years.Alarming trendThe area under jowar and millets cultivation is decreasing by at least 25,000 ha each a year. If the same trend continues, we will not be able to see millets and jowar in the coming years. The fate of oil seeds and paddy is also similar, he said.He pointed out that one of the basic objectives of the MNREGA was productive asset creation.Keeping this objective in perspective, promotion of millets and jowar cultivation was also productive asset creation. We have submitted a proposal to the Union government in this regard.The Union government is also contemplating convergence of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and agriculture. Such a move will help the farming sector in a big way, Dr. Kammaradi said.The commission was aware of the dwindling interest on potato cultivation among farmers in Hassan district.

Only a few farmers visited the APMC yard in the last two days to purchase seed potato, available in the range of Rs. 1,200 to Rs. 1,400 a quintal.Only 150 quintals of seed potato, sufficient to cultivate on 10 hectares (ha), were purchased on the first day.Last year, the demand for seed potato was more and the district administration had a tough time handling the sale. This time, the district administration and elected representatives have decided against fixing a price.ReasonDemand for potato had come down in Punjab causing a fall in its price.According to merchants, who bring seed potato from Punjab, a quintal costs around Rs. 400 there. They finalised the price considering the transportation cost and charges for keeping the stock in cold storage units. However, the growers feel that the price fixed by the merchants was too high. This is also said to be one of the reasons for the poor response to the sale of seed potato.Subsidy packageB. Suma, Deputy Director, Horticulture, said the department was providing a subsidy package worth Rs. 5,000 per ha of potato. This included bio-fertilizer, pesticides and crop insurance. We are hopeful that sales will pick up in the coming days, she said.Adequate stockSeed potato sufficient for 28,000 ha have arrived in Hassan. However, the area to be cultivated by potato is expected to decrease as many growers have opted for ginger cultivation. As of now ginger is cultivated on over 12,000 ha in the district."

They are desperately awaiting restoration of the road links as the stored rations are running short.Snow-clearing operation on the highway between Manali and Keylong, the headquarters of the Lahaul-Spiti district, is likely to end by May 15, Col K.P. Rajendra Kumar, commander of the 38 Task Force of the General Reserve Engineering Force (GREF), told IANS.GREF, a wing of the Border Roads Organisation that maintains the highway, is based here.The 115-km highway passes through snow-marooned Rohtang Pass, located at 3,978 metres in the Pir Panjal mountain range, 51 km from here.""We have reached close to Rohtang Pass. Our teams are working round the clock to clear the snow on both sides of the pass,"" Col Kumar said.GREF launched the snow-clearing operation on March 19.Officials said a major portion of the 20-km stretch between Rani Nullah and Gramphoo via Rohtang Pass was still under a heavy blanket of snow and it would take at least two more weeks to reopen it. The rest of the highway was almost ready for traffic.Residents of Lahaul Valley, with a population of over 20,000, eagerly await the resumption of road traffic.""We have been holed up since December. We are desperately awaiting restoration of road links,"" Tara Chand of Sissu village told IANS over telephone.He said they had been surviving for the last four months on locally grown potatoes and cabbage.""We are looking for fresh fruits and vegetables. With the thawing of snow, a few chicken traders have started reaching here after crossing icy tracks of Rohtang Pass on foot. But the prices are exorbitantly high,"" Chand added.Government-run helicopter is the only mode of transport for the locals when the Rohtang Pass is closed for traffic. Those travelling out of the area are usually the sick and the elderly.School teacher B.D. Negi, who is based in Keylong, said: ""My family seasonally migrates to Kullu town before the onset of snowfall. Now they want to come back and expect timely restoration of road links.""Every year after winter, GREF opens the Manali-Keylong highway by deploying more than 250 labourers.There was record snowfall in the region in the past winter. Even its spell got extended. The snow-clearing operation was challenging this time, said a GREF official who wished not to be named.""Some stretch near Rohtang is still under more than 80 feet of snow. We have to chip through the snow to make the way for the road,"" he added.With the help of global positioning system, engineers locate the road beneath the hill of the snow. After a bulldozer clears off the major snow, labourers manually clear the remaining snow with shovels.The Manali-Keylong highway is also strategically important as it further connects to the forward areas of Jammu and Kashmir's Ladakh region along the borders with China and Pakistan.The Lahaul Valley is populated mainly by tribals. The climatic conditions are harsh as much of the land forms part of a cold desert where the mercury drops below minus 20 degrees Celsius during winter."

Revanna, leader of the Janata Dal (Secular), has urged the State government to conduct a CID inquiry into the reasons that had prompted H.C. Divakar, Senior Geologist of Mines and Geology Department to opt for voluntary retirement.According to sources, Mr. Divakar had been prompted to seek voluntary retirement by the alleged threats to his life and pressure being mounted on him from those involved in illegal mining.Speaking to presspersons here on Monday, Mr. Revanna said that there were reports that the official was under pressure from the mining lobby. The government should collect the details of telephone calls received by him. The district administration has failed to control illegal transportation of sand. Several loads of sand are being transported against a single permit, he said.Mr. Revanna criticised the district administration for allowing merchants to sell seed potatoes at Rs.1,400 a quintal. The price of seed potato in Punjab was just Rs. 400 a quintal. The merchants, after purchasing the seed potato at Rs. 400 a quintal from Punjab, were selling it here at Rs, 1,400. If the potato growers suffer losses this year, cases will be filed against the officials. They should be held responsible for the loss suffered by the farmers, he said.Mr. Revanna expressed disappointment over the reservations announced for gram panchayat elections. In some wards, it would be difficult to find a candidate as per the reservation allotted, he said."

Demand for motorcycles, consumer goods and garments has dropped 25-50% in rural areas, at a time when sales surge as farmers usually have surplus cash after harvesting winter-sown crops.The mood is sombre after erratic weather damaged two successive crops, and banks fear defaults on loan repayments as farmers are looking for relief and subsidies after suffering heavy losses.""Falling yields and drop in farm incomes will affect the banking industry as farmers feel pressure of repaying loans. It will dent deposits as well as credit offtake,"" said Sarvjit Singh Samra, MD of Punjab-based Capital Local Area Bank, which generates 80% of its business from rural areas.Farm distress is hitting business in rural areas after unseasonal rains and hailstorms damaged crops such as wheat and vegetables and affected the quality of output. The situation is even hurting home sales in some regions. Agriculture accounts for about 18% of India's economy and is the source of livelihood for onethird of its 1.2 billion population.To be sure, makers of fast-moving consumer goods are keeping their fingers crossed since rural demand has been resilient as they posted higher growth numbers from the hinterland in the quarter ended March. While the overall FMCG market grew 7.1% last calendar year, rural growth was much higher at 10.3%, though on a lower base.This higher growth rate continued last quarter too  though companies are unsure about the impact of the recent unseasonal rains on the current quarter sales.Hindustan Unilever, the country's largest consumer products firm, has said market recovery will largely be dependent on rural India. Still, the weather and other factors will have a strong bearing on future performance.""Why we called out rural was, that all the present things of the different variables  the unseasonal rains, the wages in rural India not increasing, the quantum of rainfall  we don't know what the impact is going to be,"" said Sanjiv Mehta, managing director, said on an investor call. In the grape, pomegranate, onion and tomato hub of Malegaon in Maharashtra's Nashik district, builder Deepak Modi was selling four-five flats a month last year.Today, he is struggling to find even one buyer. ""The unseasonal rains have damaged pomegranates and other crops badly,"" said Modi, indicating that the people in the region don't have the fiscal room to make big purchase decisions.Modi's woes are echoed by sellers of motorcycles, clothes and white goods in small towns and villages across several states as well as luxury cars in Punjab. For most of them, the main customers are farmers and demand is directly related to agricultural income. The situation could become even worse if monsoon rain falls short, as some weather scientists see the likely emergence of the droughtcausing El Nino condition this year.""Sales are down 40-50% from last May,"" said Deepesh Goyal, owner of Kalyan Suzuki, a dealer in Suzuki Motor's two-wheelers in Agra. ""Nearly 60-70% of our sales come from rural India. Farmers are defaulting on bank payments and are worried over how to get finance for the upcoming sowing season,"" Goyal said. The region has many potato farmers who are struggling as prices have crashed, as rains have reduced the shelf life of the tuber after a glut in production this season.In the mango-growing Malda district of West Bengal, motorcycle sales are down as much as 40%, dealers said. ""Farmers do not have the paying capacity and even finance companies are not willing to participate. I have never come across this sort of a distraught situation,"" said Pankaj Mondol, owner of Ashalata Motorcycle, a local dealership. Mondol Electronics, a shop in Binuria village in West Bengal's Birbhum district, has seen a 30-40% drop in TV and refrigerator sales in the past two months, owner Pushpak Mondol said. ""There is hardly any disposable income in the hands of people. They are not keen to make any investment at this juncture,"" he said.In the Vidarbha region, cotton, soya bean and orange farmers have been badly hit. There are no buyers for cotton and soya bean while the unseasonal rainfall has wiped out orange and sweet-lime production.Production of kesar mangoes, one of the main varieties exported from India, has suffered a substantial decline. For ice-cream makers, unseasonal rainfall delayed the onset of summer, when sales rise. ""But, we are optimistic that demand will soon improve as temperature are rising,"" said Devanshu Gandhi, managing director of ice-cream maker Vadilal Industries. Farm woes have taken a direct toll on tractor sales. ""Last year, during the month of May, we were selling 20 tractors. But now we are selling only 12,"" said Subhas Poddar, owner of Maruti Tractors at Arambagh in Hooghly district. At Mahindra & Mahindra's farm equipment segment, domestic sales in April fell 19% from a year earlier to 17,006 units. The loss of the rabi crop has created ""negative market sentiments"", said Rajesh Jejurikar, president and chief executive of Mahindra's farm equipment and two-wheeler division.Luxury car sales in Punjab and Haryana have taken a hit as well. ""There is a perceptible decline in sales,"" said Manish, a luxury car dealer in Karnal. ""But it is expected to be temporary.""(Additional reporting by Madhvi Sally in New Delhi)"

The system, to be used internally by the government, will allow it to track market trends and assess when it needs to source cheaper vegetables directly from other centres.The food and civil supplies department has been entrusted with the task of developing the mechanism. A senior government official said the government should be able to predict prices of vegetables and food grains for 8-10 weeks. ""We want to eliminate black marketeering and have observed that prices usually rise between summer and monsoon. Prices of tomato, onions and potatoes are usually the most susceptible. This time, there is a bumper potato crop but we are not too sure about onions and tomatoes due to unseasonal rain,"" said the official.Delhi is largely dependent on other states for its food supply. However, it is also the largest wholesale market in north India. In the past, a huge difference in rates has been seen as vegetables reach the end consumer. The government hopes to use the price forecast mechanism to ensure, especially in retail, that prices aren't hiked unnecessarily.Recently, CM Arvind Kejriwal had warned black marketers, saying the government was prepared to meet the city's food demand and ensure uninterrupted supply of essential commodities. ""If black-marketers try to stock products and inflate prices, we will open our godowns and cause heavy losses to them,"" he said.a"
141,Tin drummer as poet,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Tin-drummer-as-poet/articleshow/47302907.cms,2015-05-16,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: Marcel Reich-Ranicki, the arrogant Pope of the German literary establishment, has almost always been a trenchant critic of Gunter Grass, the novelist. Of course, he had to swallow many of his old invectives and utter new praises after Grass won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1999. One such eulogy was his full-throated recognition of the poet Gunter Grass.In fact, he asserted that Grass should have won the Nobel Prize for his poetry alone, which he had begun writing even before he conceived his prose-masterpiece 'The Tin Drum'. The first slim volume of Grass' poetry, 'Preferences of the Weathercock', was published in 1956, three years before 'The Tin Drum' shook the world. It even won a literary prize. Some of these poems, ranging from the delicate and the lyrical to the reflective and the critical, not only announced the arrival of a young, promising voice (Grass was 29 years old then) but also predicted a fruitful future.In 'Open Wardrobe', perhaps the most applauded poem in this book, Grass chose simple, usable apparels and invested them with a complex significance. At the end, searching queries emerged, layering the poem with an interrogative uncertainty: Before the wardrobe falls silent, turns into wood, a distant relation of pine trees who will wear the coat one day when you're dead? What is remarkable about Grass the poet is that even when he is soft and mellifluous, his diction recollects the ghastly scandals of history, like concentration camps. Thus, in 'The Flag of Poland' in the same selection, cherries, apples, turnips and potatoes provoke him to recall those slaughters planned to perfection: First frost counts turnips, ponds gone blind, Potato fires above the horizon And men half-tangled in the smoke. It would be a gross error on our part to assume that Grass turns bafflingly metaphysical in his poems.A strict observer of actuality, he links his questions with the tragic inequality all around. And when this connection is crafted by his lyrical power, we receive specific images depicting the aporia of the human condition. Kolkata opened his eyes to the concrete exploitation thriving in this bountiful earth, impelling him to write: How, where garbage and only garbage grows, Am I to speak of Ilsebill because she is beautiful, And speak of beauty? How, here the hand in the photo Remains forever riceless, Shall I write about the cook And how she stuffs fattened geese? ('Three questions', 1977) While a brief visit to Kolkata in 1975 led to this lyric, which forms the epilogue to his surreal description of the city in the novel-cum-travelogue 'The Flounder' (1977), his six-month-long stay here in 1986 inspired him to write a long elegy with which his cruel though fervent tribute to Kolkata, 'Show Your Tongue' (1988), ends. No account of Grass the poet is complete without a mention of this chain of lyrics that unfolds our very own reality with sensitive exactitude.Details converge here, along with them pathos and bewilderment, and finally what we hear is a lament infused with desperate hope: In the present garbage already Turning to humus, promising vegetables, we found A school hidden in a shed, children Crouched over slates, practicing Bengali letters. The exercise, written over and over, In translation: Life is beautiful. This tone of meditative elegy surfaced again in his remarkable sonnet cycle 'Novemberland' (1993). The year 1993 is revealing because by then state socialism in Europe had collapsed and Germany was again one and undivided. For four long years, the poet had experienced the aggressive advance of market-driven capitalism in the heart of Europe. He was dejected.Ardent lovers of the market could question Grass' critique of capitalism and globalization, which he described as ""profit-obsessed megalomania"" in his Nobel Prize address, but one cannot but be moved by the encompassing melancholy of 'Novemberland', which also witnessed the ascent of the ""skinheads (neo-Nazis) with their ties and partings"": November is here to stay, our fear of it makes plain. Gone are the days of unbroken brightness, The last flies drop from each dull windowpane, A standstill has replaced time's fast-food lightness. The inimitable jester in Grass has offered a striking description of how the assault of the Muse produced his poesy. In 1960, long before Marcel Reich-Ranicki discovered the poet in him, Grass had outlined the genesis of his verse by saying, ""As soon as I get the feeling that there's a poem in the air again, I strictly avoid eating anything with a pod or a shell, and sally forth, even though it costs one a bit, on meaningless meaningful taxi-rides, so that the poem in the air shakes itself loose"". Dear Mr Grass, it's a pity, nay a tragedy, that your fruitful taxi rides have come to an end."

The mandis in Jaipur and other prominent cities of the state receive vegetables, fruits and pulses from other parts of the country. ""It will depend on truckers' association as to how much transportation cost they will increase after diesel price hike,"" said Radheshyam Phatak, president of Rajasthan Fruits and Vegetable Traders' Association.He said that in the nearby areas only Chomu produces vegetables. Other vegetables and fruits have to be brought from different parts of the country. ""Onions come from Nasik. An increase in transportation cost will definitely affect the prices of onions,"" Phatak explained.The impact on the prices will be seen on Monday, when mandis will reopen after Sunday's holiday, he claimed. In February, diesel was being sold at Rs 50.27 per liter, now after Friday's hike, the new price of diesel is Rs 57.55 per liter.Phatak added that potatoes come from UP and Punjab, lemons from Hyderabad and Gujarat, cauliflower from Kolkata, beans from Shimla and Bengaluru. ""We receive 10-15 trucks of safeda mango from Hyderabad daily. In UP, the production of mangoes has been hit due to erratic weather. The prices were set to rise due to less production of vegetables, and now with diesel price hike, they will further increase,"" Phatak said.Rajasthan Khadya Padarth Vyapar Sangh (RKPVS) claimed that if transportation cost increases, it will also affect the prices of other commodities. ""Pulses are being imported from countries like Myanmar and palm oil is imported from Indonesia. They are brought to Rajasthan via ports in Gujarat. A lot of transportation is involved to bring pulses and oils to Rajasthan,"" said Babu Lal Gupta, RKPVS president."
143,Urban living taking toll on health?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/478317/urban-living-taking-toll-health.html,2015-05-18,Deccan Herald,"Urban living taking toll on health?By Sudhirendar Sharma, May 19, 2015 23:05 ISTA Right to Information query revealed a startling fact that 80 Mumbaikars died every day due to heart attacks between March 2014 and March 2015. What is even more shocking is the fact that this is up from 67 deaths daily during the same period the previous year.Turn the clock back by 15 years; death rate due to heart attacks was only 22 deaths per day. Could it only be the stress of urban living that is taking a heavy toll on the heart?According to Dr Ajay Chaug-hule, a heart surgeon at the Global Hospital in Parel, easy availability of high-fat food items and sugary drinks makes urbanites more prone to lifestyle diseases. Coronary artery disease is a lifestyle disease worsened by urbanisation, he says. However, coronary heart disease cases in the country have more than doubled to 61 million from a rather manageable 27 million cases in 2000. The trend is ominous.It has been reported that doubling of incomes between 1997 and 2005 contributed to heart diseases replacing diarrhoea as the erstwhile giant killer. However, if increasing prosperity on account of economic liberalisation has led to spurt in heart diseases, then economic growth ought to be viewed as a public health crisis in the making. It may indeed be so as a World Bank study estimates that cardiovascular diseases will account for 36 per cent deaths in the country in 2030.If such were the impact of economic change then the developed world should have been its victim longtime over. Conversely, it is a developing country phenomenon where rise in non-communicable diseases including heart ailments are attributed to unhealthy lifestyles of individuals, making no one but themselves to blame for it. Since neither a bug nor a vector causes heart ailments, people are left to fend for their new-found ailment.Changing external environment and its relationships to health can no longer be an individuals sole responsibility, argues Dinesh Sharma, author of Know Your Heart. The common perception that it is individual lifestyle that is the cause for rising heart ailments not only absolves the health administration of any responsibility but pushes it into further inaction as well. Health care professionals and doctors have been perpetuating such perception no less.Clearly, there is a gap between common perception and ground reality. The reality is that as many as 3 million and 14 million cardiovascular disease deaths were averted in the UK and US respectively, in the three decades between 1970 and 2000. It has been the direct result of joint action by the government, health professionals and food companies in inculcating healthy lifestyles, by helping citizens avoid unhealthy diet and check tobacco consumption.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has long argued that governments have a crucial role to play in improving the health of its populace by giving individuals equitable access to a healthy life. Supportive state policies can influence the behaviour of people in relation to three major factors contributing to heart disease: unhealthy diet, tobacco consumption and physical inactivity.Heartcare treatmentIndias government response has been found patchy in this regard, focusing instead on heartcare treatment than prevention at any level. No surprise, the food processing industry enjoys incentives, concessions and loans. In the absence of regulatory restrictions on quality of processed foods, all farm-to-fork companies are having a field day. The present government has supported the Futures Group for setting up a Food Park in Karnataka.Since demand for packaged food is growing at a rate of 3 per cent each year, need for regulating trans-fats, saturated fatty acids and sodium content ought to be given utmost priority. Far from it, the government has thus far refrained from fixing limits on permissible levels of trans-fats, saturated fatty acids and salt to be declared on food labels, which contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes and heart diseases.Packaged food is just one aspect, tax breaks for aerated drinks and indirect subsidies for potato chips contribute significantly to sugar and salt intake. Sugar and salt intake by Indians is higher than the WHO prescribed limits. Since people have little choice over the packaged food products on offer, unsuspecting consumers become victim of the state-industry nexus. Hidden links between state policy and corporate greed are playing with the hearts of its people.A country that has an estimated 63 million cases of diabetics and as many as 120 million people with high blood pressure, both of which are silent contributors to heart failure, cannot remain oblivious to the impending disaster. Need it be said that the country needs change on a larger scale along with individual prevention and efforts in clinical settings to control and prevent the tide of heart diseases. Like programmes for prevention and control of blindness, cancer and HIV, specific programmes need to be initiated to discourage unhealthy diets and promote healthy food.(The writer is a development writer and analyst)"

The short term growth may be lower on account of structural issues which we are tackling,"" Mehrishi told PTI.Strong economic growth, he added, is necessary for solving many socio-economic problems facing the country.""India's growth is expected to be at least 8 per cent in the current fiscal on account of initiatives taken by the government to boost investment and growth,"" Mehrishi said.The Economic Survey had projected a growth of 8.1 to 8.5 per cent in the current financial year.""Multilateral institutions also share our growth optimism. IMF has projected a growth of 7.5 per cent for 2015-16. Other organisations also project the growth to be in the vicinity of 7.5 per cent,"" he added.As per the latest World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India will surpass China in terms of growth to become the fastest growing large economy in the world.IMF expects India to grow at 7.5 per cent in both 2015 and 2016, while China's growth rate has been projected at 6.8 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively.""Though the recovery in advanced economies is slow, the external environment for India is benign,"" Mehrishi said.The government has taken various initiatives to deal with the structural issues like going in for auction of key infrastructure inputs such as coal and spectrum, setting up of the MUDRA Bank and streamlining the norms for foreign direct investment (FDI).On India Meteorological Department (IMD) projection of below normal monsoon, the Finance Secretary said: ""A weak monsoon generally leads to low rural economic growth and spike in prices of food commodities. However, this year food prices are expected to remain stable.""He added: ""As done in last year, government could offload stocks from its godowns especially wheat and rice to cool down prices of food grains, discouraging exports of those food commodities like potato and onion, which has the potential of highest price volatility and importing those items, which are short in supply like pulses and edible.""The government, he further said, was also taking a host of steps to address rural distress ""through programmes rather that price distorting measures"".The initiatives include viable crop insurance programmes for benefit of farmers and scaling up MNREGA in distress villages and rural areas, he added."

147,Fourth term: Rise of youth brigade,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150521/jsp/odisha/story_21195.jsp,2015-05-21,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, May 20: When a year ago, Naveen Patnaik picked his team for his fourth term as the chief minister, he wanted a balance of the old and the new. The performance and role of the minister in the past one year shows that the power equations have changed swiftly.The young ministers, including newcomers, have emerged powerful, while the old guards have been marginalised. The emergence of young ministers in the new dispensation has pushed the veterans to the wings, but they prefer to keep quiet. The ministers who hog the limelight are Bikram Keshari Arukh (parliamentary affairs), Arun Kumar Sahoo (law), Ashok Panda (culture), Pranab Prakash Das (energy) and Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak (health). Excepting for Arukh, all others enjoy the rank of ministers of state with independent portfolios and report directly to the chief minister.Parliamentary affairs minister Bikram Keshari Arukh, who hails from Naveen's home district Ganjam, has quietly emerged as the key personality over the last one year. His ascendancy has led to the marginalisation of many party veterans. Notwithstanding his seniority, he is often heard replying on behalf of the chief minister in the Assembly on major issues. In the party and the government, he is considered as Naveen's alter ego.The other minister to have emerged powerful is first-timer Arun Sahu, who handles the important portfolio of law. Despite last year's rath yatra controversy, he has managed to enjoy the trust of Naveen.Health minister Atanu Sabyascahi Nayak, who had defeated Naveen's bete noire and BJP leader Bijoy Mohapatra, continues to enjoy the confidence of the chief minister. He holds two important portfolios - health & family welfare and information & public relations. He remained in the limelight as the Naveen government had been focusing on health care and announcing one scheme after another. He is considered to be one of the ministers who is firmly in the saddle. Nothing moves in the departments without his consent.Journalist-turned-politician, tourism and culture minister, Ashok Chandra Panda, known for his proximity with the chief minister for a long time now, has emerged as a key figure in Naveen's council of ministers. The first time minister has managed to silence his critics in the party and has proven to be one of the most efficient ministers. Aware of Naveen's soft corner for culture and tourism, Panda has managed to make the right moves to be on the right side of the chief minister. ""It's the people who are powerful. I am working hard and have introduced a number of schemes to promote tourism and culture in the state. The one-year journey has been full of challenges.""Another first timer Pranab Prakash Das, minister of state for energy and IT, has emerged as one of the most powerful politicians from the politically sensitive Jajpur district. Circumstances have helped Das to become a key figure in Naveen's coterie. He has filled the vacuum created by Rajya Sabha MP Kalapataru Das and former finance minister Prafulla Ghadei. Das, who had called the shots in the party before the last general elections, was eased out of the Naveen's core group after the CAG report pointed out that the MP's family members had managed to corner more than one house in the city through the discretionary quota. Veteran leader Ghadei was thrown out of the party for his outbursts against the leadership.As the junior ministers rise to positions eminence and authority, senior leaders such as Damodar Rout, Pradeep Maharathy, Badri Narayan Patra and Bijoyshree Routray are less heard and seen in public. FAILURES Jaundice outbreakGovernment has failed to check the spread of jaundice in urban areas, particularly in Sambalpur. Around 50 people have already lost their lives and over a thousand people affected across the state. Fresh cases are being reported from Balangir, where three people have died. The failure of the government has come under the scanner of Orissa High Court.Potato crisisPotato disappeared from the menu several times during the year. The price of a kilo of potato, which usually varied between Rs 8 and Rs 12, went beyond Rs 40 twice in the last one year. There was a stand off between the governments of Bengal and Odisha on the issue. The state governments potato mission encouraged farmers to grow the crop. But, when it arrived in February, the state witnessed a distress sale with the price dropping to Rs 2 for lack of cold stores.Nabakalebar deadlineThe grand event is expected to have a footfall of nearly 50 lakh. The event will culminate in July. According to the government, everything was to be in place by March 31. However, a reality check by government agencies has revealed that it would be difficult to achieve the deadline. All its projects pertaining to drainage, sewerage and state roads are half complete.Industrialisation hurdleNo big-ticket project could take off. The South Korean steel giant Posco seemed to have developed a cold feet. There are indications that it might withdraw from the project. While the government is seeking payment from the company for acquiring and developing the land, Posco has sought details of its money given to the government for its project.Deposit collection scamThe state government faced embarrassment after BJD Lok Sabha MP from Mayurbhanj Ramachandra Hansda and Banki MLA Pravat Tripathy were arrested by the CBI for their alleged involvement in the deposit collection scam. A member of the chief minister's household staff had also been quizzed. The advocate-general stepped down from the office and is facing aninquiry. ACHIEVEMENTS Aahar YojanaIn a bid to woo the urban poor, the state government started the cheap food scheme Aahar. Rice and dalma (a popular dish made of dal and vegetables) is available at Rs 5 per plate in urban areas. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik launched the scheme in Bhubaneswar and Rourkela on April 1. The scheme is run in five cities - Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Berhampur, Sambalpur and Rourkela. Biju ExpresswayThe Rs 3,200-crore Biju Expressway, a 650km Jagdalpur-Rourkela corridor that will connect southern parts of the state with west Odisha, was launched on August 28 last year. The road project will connect four western districts - Bargarh, Sambalpur, Jharsuguda, and Sundargarh  with Koraput, Nabarangpur, Kalahandi and Nuapada in the Koraput-Balangir-Kalahandi region. The first phase of the project is expected to be over by May 2017, and the entire project by May 2020. Niramaya schemeThe state government has started its free medicine distribution scheme  Niramaya  from May 1 with chief minister Naveen Patnaik launching it at Capital Hospital. The scheme is being implemented in all the 30 district headquarters hospitals, three government-run medical colleges and hospitals in the state and the Capital Hospital in the first phase. Later it will be extended to all community and primary health centres. Mukhya Mantri Sadak YojanaWith focus on bijli, sadak, pani, the BJD government launched a road connectivity scheme  Mukhyamantri Sadak Yojana  in 2014-15 on the lines of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. The scheme promises road links to villages having a minimum population of 100 and those left out under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Biju Pucca Ghar YojanaThe state government has launched a Rs 3,000-crore scheme in September to convert all mud and thatched houses into concrete structures. The existing 'Mo Kudia' scheme has been merged with the new scheme named as Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana. The government seeks to construct five lakh concrete houses this year. HOW FARES NAVEEN Pratibha SatpathyAuthor5/10The deposit collection scam has made corruption visible in this government. Not that we had corruption-free governments in the past, but these scams are just going too far. Also, Naveens populist schemes such as Aahar and Re 1 per kg rice will make Odias lazy. We also expect him to speak his fathers tongue by now, though Im sure he knows it well now but does not use it. Anu ChoudhuryActress10/10Naveen babu is an able administrator and has made his way into peoples hearts. He has earned respect for his schemes for the poor. I personally admire his dignified personality. Nalinikant PandaEngineering student7/10Naveen Patnaik scores on his inclination to implement technology into governance. But its also a let down to see technical institutes deteriorate and campus placements decrease. Pritam PandaFashion designer8.5/10The handloom sector as well as fashion sector have been given some importance this year. Especially, the plan to have incubation centres for upcoming fashion entrepreneurs is a big boost to this field. Bijoy MohapatraSenior BJP leader2/10I will give him two marks only because he has been winning the mandate of people. Lipsa DasCorporate employee8/10I love the way Bhubaneswar is growing. The state highways and connectivity between various districts is improving. Agreed that there are scams, but for an average middle class person the government has fared well. Piyush Ranjan RoutUrban development expert6/10He has done exceedingly well in taking forward pro-poor measures. He must take steps for the overall development of the state. PL KandoiPresident, Kalinga Nagar Industries AssociationIt wont be proper for me to rate him. But his government is not serious to give a boost to the industrialisation of the state. Narasingha MishraLeader of Opposition3/10Taking his popularity into account, I can give three marks. On the development front, he is quite dreadful. Janardan PatiCPM leader3/10I give him three marks because he has withstood pressure from the BJP led Government at the Centre. Unlike the AIDMK, he has not surrendered before the BJP. Prasad HarichandanOdisha Pradesh Congress president2/10He does not deserve even two marks, as he has totally failed in all sectors of development. CONTROVERSIES Discretionary quotaThe accountant-generals report said that powerful and influential people had managed to use the discretionary quota system of the state government to acquire landed property in prime areas of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The list of beneficiaries  mostly politicians, bureaucrats and media persons  read too long and embarrassed the Naveen Patnaik government. (The Telegraph was the first to carry the report). The state government appointed IAS officer Taradatt to examine it. Taradatt recommended the cancellation of all the allotments made through the discretionary quota between 1995 and 2014. Taradatt was subsequently shifted. Maharathy vs RadharaniIn the Assembly, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy, allegedly made vulgar remarks to a woman member of the BJP. This led to disruption of Assembly proceedings and the BJP took to the streets. Maharathy, however, tendered an apology and bought peace with the woman legislator Radharani Panda. Ghadei goesOnce a trusted lieutenant of Naveen and former finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei was denied a BJD ticket in the 2014 Assembly elections. An astute politician that Naveen is, he shifted Ghadeis son Priti Ranjan to his fathers seat and denied Prafulla the party ticket. Angry senior Ghadei in an interview to a vernacular daily attacked the coterie around Naveen and also questioned the CMs ability to run the state. He was promptly shown the door. Itishree Pradhan caseThe murder of a 27-year-old schoolteacher, Itishree Pradhan, a victim of sexual harassment, rocked the state in 2013. In her dying declaration, she blamed the administration and named powerful politicians and officials for the incident. A casual probe by the district administration revealed that she had made a number of petitions to the authorities and there was laxity on the part of the government. The incident hogged limelight after the Supreme Court took up the case last year and asked the CBI to probe into it. IIM blame gameThe site selection for the proposed Indian Institute of Management (IIM) continues to haunt the state government. The BJP made it a prestige issue after the government wanted the institute on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar. The BJP wants the institute in Sambalpur.A BJP delegation met the Union HRD minister Smriti Irani demanding the IIM in west Odisha. Following a letter from her, the state government made a U-turn and threw the ball back to the Centres court saying that it had no objection if the central government changed its guidelines to locate the institute in Sambalpur.

Coimbatore gets vegetables from different parts of the country. For instance, potato comes from even Gujarat and Agra. The prices of vegetables are expected to go up further in another week as unseasonal rains have affected crops, say traders here.Carrot, potato, beans, leafy vegetables, and cabbage are cultivated on about 7,000 hectares in The Nilgiris. There are some farmers who cultivate spring onions, broccoli, capsicum, etc. Most of these are three-month crops and farmers usually go in for harvest in June or July.Prakash, who cultivates vegetables in The Nilgiris, says that rains during the last few days have damaged a substantial portion of crops. So the rates have doubled in the last four days.Cabbage, which was sold at Rs. 30 a kg was priced at Rs. 40 a kg now (wholesale rate); similarly, the price of beans had shot up to Rs. 80 a kg from Rs. 30 a kg.Farmers started harvesting early as the prices were good and also because they feared that vegetables would be damaged in the rain.Spring onions come from Karnataka to The Nilgiris, he says.An official of the horticulture department in The Nilgiris contended that if the rains had continued for a couple of days, it would have damaged vegetable crops.However, now the impact is not much.There were reports of farmers going in for early cultivation of vegetables, especially cabbage, in one or two fields, the official said."

Governor Najeeb Jung all powers over transfers and posting of officials.At a meeting of its legislators on Sunday, the Aam Aadmi Party described the home ministry notification of Thursday as ""unconstitutional"", and the government has decided to call a special assembly session May 26-27 to discuss the central order.AAP leader and former minister Saurabh Bhardwaj told media persons after the meeting that the central government was ""shadow-boxing"".""The notification that the central government has brought is not only unconstitutional, but it is against the basic principles of democracy,"" he said.The meeting was attended by Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia.Added another AAP legislator Alka Lamba: ""If the chief minister doesn't have a right to appoint and suspend officials, then how is an elected government of Delhi supposed to fight corrupt officials?""""After discussion (in the assembly), if needed, we will go to the court,"" she said.An official said the public meeting at central park in Connaught Place on Monday will highlight achievements of the AAP government.AAP media coordinator Deepak Bajpai said the AAP government has delivered on its promises.""The anti-corruption helpline is in place to check corruption. Party MLAs are reaching out to the people and solving their problems.

""Question us, criticise us, hang us if we are corrupt or wrong but don't spread false rumours,"" he said.The ""clarificatory"" home ministry notification on Thursday came after days of intense wrangling between the Kejriwal government and Lt Governor Jung over transfer and posting of senior officials.It also took away powers of the anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) to prosecute ""officers, employees and functionaries"" of the central government."
152,State of the nation – asli baat,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Dehati-Aadmi/state-of-the-nation-asli-baat/,2015-05-25,The Times Of India,"The samosa-kachodi seller provides cooked food to the potato and oil supplier in lieu of payment. He gets free labour in exchange of some more cooked food from the guards in the neighbourhood who peel potatoes and do other work. The sarkari and privatised cleaning lot get paid in cooked food in return too. The authorities provide protection against unfair government rules in exchange for cooked food. Customers line up to buy for cash and get extra gravy without any tension. The stall on the pavement gets regularized and gets a proper power connection for election support judiciously distributed to all possible winners. The pigs and stray dogs in the vicinity provide night security because they are assured of food the next day if they do so.Down the road the guy selling fruit has an even better deal going. The banks have their CCTV cameras pointed on to his cart so that nobody takes it away at night. The re-supply of fresh fruit comes in the morning from ATM vans returning empty and this is done 2-3 times a day. And everybody who represents governance eats healthy instead of going to the pizza MNC across the wall.The number of tax-paying middle-class people I know who have also moved their worklife or hobbies into cash or barter economies over the last few months or years of control economy by a government bent on only fattening itself and those who work for the government is not even funny anymore and at a modest estimate in my humble opinion this is more than the GDP of the country which is yet another piece of fiction.And then, they all go and buy gold and stick it in some safe place somewhere far from the city. And then we are told that India has to ask for capital and money from abroad. The government wants people to take their gold out and exchange it for pieces of paper. Fat chance, that, who trusts the government lately?Yeah, sure.Many decades ago I thought I had the cash economy figured out as a freight forwarder. Its only grown multiple times since then.Thats state of the nation today.And if you really want to know the state of the nation regardless of who is in power, look at the cancelled, diverted and re-scheduled trains, and also do a search basis arrival/departure timings of trains at important stations, right in the midst of the holiday season where people have booked tickets 2-4 months in advance.Most of the people I know would presumably use air travel as preferred mode of going on holiday. There is, however, the rest of the country which opts for train travel and for that, books 2-3-4 months in advance, full money down.For them, the reality of one year of this government or 68 years of all governments put together is the fact that not only will they now have to change their plans, probably at a higher cost if they fly, but will also see service tax and service charges being deducted from the refund they get if they go through the process of refund in a short time window from planned departure of the now cancelled trains.Think about it.The number of trains shown here as cancelled or diverted or re-scheduled does not include those which will be cancelled at the last minute with a brutal announcement once the passengers also known as the public have reached the railway station platform, hung around there for hours asking each other and coolies for information, and then hearing a loudspeaker telling them that khedh hai but you are screwed and we dont give a shit kind of announcement.From and to Delhi in all directions  North, South, East and West, also Central.

Police said Jamiruddin Sheikh was found writhing in pain at his home in Dhameli in the Pukuria area in Chanchal, about 30km from here, around 9pm yesterday. He was admitted to the Malda Medical College and Hospital where he died around 11pm. Jamiruddin was survived by his wife, Jotsnara Bibi, son Abdul Kuddus, 22, and daughter, Sultana Parveen, 18. The farmer's body was handed over to his next of kin after post-mortem. Kamiruddin Sheikh, the farmer's brother, said Jamiruddin had sown potato and paddy on four bighas of land earlier this year. ""He had grown potato on one bigha, but he did not get a proper price for the crop. There were 600kg potato, but he sold the produce at less than Rs 4 a kilo, leading to a loss. He had also sown paddy on three bighas of land and that was destroyed in a storm that hit the Chanchal area on May 21. He had told me that he had borrowed Rs 50,000 from a local money lender. My brother became morose after that and yesterday he consumed poison and committed suicide,"" the brother said. The block development officer of Ratua II, Mohan Majhi, under whose jurisdiction the incident occurred, said he was not aware of the suicide.""I have no information about a farmer committing suicide. I am looking into the matter,"" Majhi said."

The price of capsicum and carrot and broad beans went up by Rs.20. Courgette and cabbage prices increased from Rs.30 per kg to Rs. 40 per kg in a week time.The vegetables such as cucumber (Rs.10 per kg), potato (Rs.20 per kg) were being sold at relatively lesser price. The increase in prices has been attributed to continuous heat waves in both the Telangana and the Andhra Pradesh since the production of most of the vegetables came down.Due to lack of refrigerated transport facilities, the vegetables were also being wasted during the transportation with prevailing heat conditions.The traders in the market said that the sudden spurt in the prices of some vegetables was just an indication that the tough days are ahead.Unless the monsoon arrives early, the traders said that the prices would go up further within no time.Burden on familiesSpeaking to The Hindu , a housewife P. Shanthi, said that the increase in vegetable prices have increased the burden on them since the prices of all pulses have also doubled during the past one month. We have been restricting ourselves to only a few vegetables that are being sold at cheaper price, but we could not avoid tomato any longer, she said.Meanwhile, increase in the prices after a two months lull in the market brought cheer among the farmers since they sold tomatoes, lady finger and a few other vegetable at less than Rs.10 per kg."

157,More cold chain projects welcome,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/481040/more-cold-chain-projects-welcome.html,2015-06-02,Deccan Herald,"More cold chain projects welcomeBengaluru, June 2, 2015, DHNS: 0:11 ISTThe Union Ministry of Food Processing Industries recently sanctioned setting up of 30 new cold chain projects, bringing the total approvals in the sector to 138. Once all of them become operational, they are expected to add 4.76 lakh tonnes of storage capacity and 118 lakh litres per day of milk processing capacity to the countrys infrastructure. Already, 56 of the 138 projects have commenced operations, and they couldnt have happened any day sooner since a recent study by Assocham found the total cold chain storage capacity in the country at a poor 35 million tonnes, against the requirement of at least 61 million tonnes. A study by CIPHET in 2013 found that the country wastes around Rs 44,000 crore worth of fruits, vegetables, and grains every year. Assocham said 30 per cent of Indias annual fish catch of 10 million tonnes is wasted. And the consensus view is that the biggest contributors to this wastage are the lack of refrigerated transport, and inadequate cold chain infrastructure.The Assocham study zeroed in on specific woes of the sector. One is the uneven distribution of cold chain infrastructure with Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal accounting for 64 per cent of the capacity. Another is the prevalence of obsolete ammonia refrigeration systems with slow-speed compressors, which are power guzzlers and take up lot of space with their need for large, bunker-style evaporator coils. Again, a disproportionate 75 per cent of the installed capacity is suitable only for potato storage, when the revenues earned from this commodity account for only 20 per cent of the total since rentals for the tuber are low. It is clear that the sector needs investments in energy-efficient refrigeration, multi-crop storage, and even distribution of facilities.Successive governments have been seized of the urgency to shore up infrastructure in the sector, and a host of incentives have been made available. A nodal agency, National Centre for Cold-chain Development, has been set up to promote installation of cold chains; 100 per cent FDI is allowed under the automatic route; deduction for capital investment is allowed up to 150 per cent; investments in storage have been made eligible for viability gap funding; and cold chains have been recognised as an infrastructure sub-sector. Recently, the RBI stepped in to classify loans to the sector under priority sector lending. This would make the sector eligible for low-interest rate loans. Its time for private enterprises to step up to the plate and tap these incentives so that the whole country gains from reducing the wastage in transferring produce from the farm to the fork."
158,Bengal takes measures ahead of weak monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bengal-takes-measures-ahead-of-weak-monsoon/article7279983.ece,2015-06-04,The Hindu,": With the Met Department predicting deficit monsoon, the West Bengal government is putting in place measures to tackle the situation at a time of rising deaths of distressed potato farmers.A meeting of agriculture department officials has been scheduled for next week.An important tenet of the strategy is supplying farmers in drought prone areas with drought-resistant paddy seeds and other inputs that will help cut costs. Irrigation pushes up costs and there is a case for increasing diesel subsidy, West Bengal Agriculture Minister Purnendu Bose told The Hindu .Nearly 60 per cent of West Bengals farm activity is rain-fed with the western districts of Bankura, Birbhum, Purulia and Paschim Medinipur being among the drought-prone districts which have received less rainfall during the 2014-15 kharif season. It was learnt that these districts lack irrigation facilities, and cultivation is mainly rain-fed. The governments strategy in areas like these has been and will be (if the predictions come true) to increase crop productivity, the minister said.Additionally the government is also emphasising on the use of farm mechanisation and modernisation. Mr Bose said that under a Centrally Sponsored scheme custom hiring of equipment was being encouraged to enable small and marginal farmers to use equipment such as harvesters.Under this scheme, the resources are collectively pooled with a part sponsorship by the State government to make available equipment to small farmers.Rainwater harvesting assumes renewed focus in view of the impending rainfall shortage."

However, what many do not realise is that noodles from any manufacturer or for that matter, any food product that comes under instant, ready to eat and packaged category, is not a healthy food option at all, experts maintain.Senior nutritionists point out that processed food means there will be preservatives, colorants, additives and chemicals that are needed to add colour, texture to increase shelf life. Once sugar, salt and fat are added to enhance the taste of the food products, thanks to their addictive properties, the consumer, mostly children, do get hooked.Naturally occurring milk will remain fresh for a day or two, but when someone claims that you can store it for a week then it means they are weaning away the naturally occurring nutrients from milk and adding preservatives. Any noodle brand, devoid of nutritional value, with loads of sugar and salt should be avoided at any cost because they are junk food, says senior nutritionist and Director, Akshaya Foundation, Sunita Sapur.What is junk food?By and large, doctors define junk food as food items having high percentage of sugar, fat, salt and also has high calorific value with very little or no nutritional elements. Processed potato chips, noodles, soft drinks, burgers, deep fried Indian snacks do come under the category of junk food.The worst part is, in India there are no checks or regulation of processed food. Consumers too arent much aware of the pitfalls of consuming processed food over a long period of time. There are desi snacks like Idli, upma, dosa, sprouts, poha etc that are far better options and can be consumed fresh, says Head, Department of Nutrition, Care Hospitals, Nampally, Dr. Madhurima Sinha.Nutritionists point out that MSG, which is a flavour enhancer and very commonly added in Chinese delicacies, is added in a host of food products like chocolate, chips, biscuits, sodas, sauces etc. These are all artificial taste and colour enhancers that do not have any nutritional value at all. The sugar added in processed food does not contain fructose, which can be digested easily, explains Radhika Reddy, Chief Dietician, KIMS Hospital.Health implications from processed food are immense, caution experts. They are known to cause bowel and Gastro-Intestinal (GI) tract cancers. Liver gets extensively damaged. MSG, particularly, is known to cause nerve damage, damage to GI tract, cramps and diarrhoea, says Director, Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Maxcure Hospitals, Madhapur, Dr. Asha Subbalakshmi. M.

At present, onions arriving in the market are the summer crop having shelf life of six to seven months. We have procured around 1,100 tonnes of onions so far at a total cost of Rs 1.80 crore. The central government has given us Rs 5 crore under the PSF so far. More funds are expected to be released soon.""The sources further said, ""The government has given us a target of procuring 10,000 tonnes of onions. We have onion storage capacity of 2,500 tonnes at Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon. We are also planning to use the storage facilities of farmers.""The government has made a provision of Rs 500 crore under PSF in the budget to control the prices of perishable commodities. The fund is to be used to control prices of onion and potatoes for the current and next financial years. The PSF is to be used to advance interest-free loans to state governments and central agencies like NAFED, which will buy onions directly from the farmers or at the APMCs, keeping in mind the scarcity of onions and rise in prices in future.The summer crop, which is harvested in March and April every year, has a shelf life of six to seven months and caters to the market until the arrival of the khairf crop by September-end. Thereafter, the kharif and late kharif crops cater to the market until arrival of the summer crop by March every year. The shelf life of kharif and late kharif crops is not more than a month. Hence, only summer crop is stored by farmers with the hope of getting better price to the commodity. Scarcity is created if this cycle is affected. Hence, August-October is a crucial period when chances of onion scarcity and thus price rise are high. The state government has, therefore, asked NAFED to procure onions to overcome scarcity and rising prices of onions in the coming few months."

And it does not seem like there will be a respite anytime soon with officials warning that the prices may go up further in the coming days.The costliest of the lot are brinjal and carrot which were available at Rs 12 per kg and Rs 22 per kg respectively a month ago. Even till June 2, brinjal was on offer at Rs 22 a kg. Carrots cost Rs 38 per kg during the same period.However, the price of brinjal touched Rs 34 a kg while carrot ruled all the four rythu bazaars in the city at Rs 50 per kg on Sunday.Lady's finger, bottle gourd and ginger have also turned costly in the last few days.""Decrease in the production due to lack of rains and intense summer is the reason for the prices to surge. Earlier we used to get brinjal from Kanuru where it was cultivated in more than 300 acres. Real estate activity reduced the acreage significantly. This in turn led to lesser yield,"" explained S Veeraiah, a farmer at Patamata rythu bazar.""It is becoming increasingly difficult to cope with the spiraling prices of basic commodities. And the problem is that even if we shell out all the extra bucks, the quality of the vegetables keeps on falling day by day,"" rued Suresh Gupta who was purchasing vegetables from the Maidan rythu bazar.Sheik Ameer Babu, estate officer of Patamata rythu bazaar, told ToI that the prices of brinjal will increase further in the next two days.""It will definitely touch Rs 40-42 mark in the next two to three days. However, the rates will again stablise in a week's time,"" he assured.Lady's finger, available for just Rs 12 on June 2, was being sold at Rs 20 per kg on Sunday. Bottle gourd shot up by Rs 6 and snake gourd by Rs 4 in the span of four days. French beans shot up by Rs 10 and is trading at Rs 92 per kg.""We were importing carrots from Bangalore and brinjal from Hanuman Junction, which is the reason for price hike. But the rates of essential vegetables like tomato, onion, chillies and potato have remained stable,"" diclosed Ramesh Babu, estate officer of Swaraj Maidan rythu bazaar.Since this was the state of affairs at rythu bazaars, vendors at private markets and those on the roadside had a field day. Brinjal was sold at Rs 44 a kg, carrot crossed Rs 56, lady's finger at Rs 28 and bottle gourd at Rs 20 a kg.""The capital city has not been built and we are already being forced to buy vegetables selectively.

162,Platter bears short supply brunt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150608/jsp/odisha/story_24454.jsp,2015-06-08,Telegraph,"A shopkeeper sells onion at a market in Bhubaneswar. Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, June 7: Onion and chicken prices have climbed over the past one-and-a-half weeks due to scant supply. The price of onion has increased because of limited supply from Nasik in Maharashtra, while the chicken price has increased following the large-scale death of birds due to heat wave in hatcheries across Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. Besides, the retarded growth of chicken in the neighbouring state has also resulted in short supply, and in turn, now Odisha has to supply chicken to Andhra. Sujata Rath, a teacher at a management institute in the city, said: ""Onion is now selling at Rs 28-a-kg as compared to Rs 20 a week ago."" Gayadhar Swain, general secretary of the Unit-I Traders' Association, said: ""Limited supply from Nasik is the main reason behind the price rise. Traders of Rourkela and Jharsuguda mainly procure the onion produced in Kantabanjhi and Balangir, and we have no supply chain with the producers. Once the link is established, we can also buy from them."" Earlier, the state used to get nearly 1,200 tonnes of onion daily from Nasik. Now, it has dropped to around 900 tonnes. Earlier, consumers in Bhubaneswar used to buy around 200 tonnes of onion daily, and now, the supply has come down to 120 tonnes a day. Food and supplies minister Sanjay Das Burma said: ""We will look into every aspect of onion supply from the western belt, where farmers are suffering losses."" ""The per-quintal rate of onion in Nasik has gone up to Rs 1,700 to Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,300. After adding transportation charges of Rs 420 a quintal, the selling price of per quintal onion in Bhubaneswar becomes around Rs 2,400. When the loss due to heat is taken into consideration, the retail price becomes Rs 2,800 a quintal or more,"" said market intelligence officer Deepak Kumar Satpathy. Sources said crop loss due to heat wave was the main reason behind the short supply from Nasik. A senior department official, however, said there was no alarming situation regarding onion supply in Odisha. Scarcity of onion and potato appears to have become the teething problem in the state. ""The National Horticulture Research Development Foundation has decided to start a research station at Boudh in west Odisha to produce onion variety, which can be stored for a longer period. The state government has also plans to create storage facilities at four major places in west Odisha for storing onion,"" said an official of the horticulture department. The chicken supply, on the other hand, is dipping due to death of thousands of birds in the hatcheries, especially in south and west Odisha. A poultry farmer from Khurda district, Prashant Kumar Behera, said: ""Andhra Pradesh has seen a huge loss of poultry birds this season and so has Odisha. Besides, the birds are not growing properly due to the heat."" The poultry birds are dying due to heat wave-like condition. As the mercury rises to 40 or 45 degrees Celsius, the temperature inside the poultry shed gets higher than that. It causes physiological changes in the birds causing death. Their growth also becomes retarded in the heat. Today in the open market, chicken is sold between Rs 180 and Rs 200 per kilogram, while at the Chicken Fresh outlet of the fisheries and animal resources development department, the rate was Rs 155. When the outlet was inaugurated at Saheed Nagar on May 24, the rate was Rs 120 per kilogram. Odisha State Poultry Products Co-operative Marketing Federation Limited managing director Prashant Biswal said: ""This year, an unusual thing happened. Earlier, the surplus production of poultry used to come from Andhra Pradesh to Odisha. But, due to the huge loss of poultry birds in Andhra, birds from Odisha are being supplied there, causing a scarcity in the local markets."" ""Once the temperature becomes normal during rains, the growth of the poultry birds will be stabilised. In turn, the productions then can also match the demand. The poultry birds are grown from chicks to fully grown adults within 35 to 45 days,"" said Biswal."

Suma, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department said on Friday that each farmer would be given two quintals of certified seed potatoes for sowing in their farmland. We have selected the potato growers in all taluks for this programme.

In the last 10 years, farmers started losing interest in the crop due to late blight disease, which causes huge decline in the yield. This year, the quantity of seeds purchased by farmers would suffice for sowing in about 14,000 hectares of land. While many farmers have already completed the sowing of seeds, a few are still waiting for good spells of rain.For many years, the growers have been demanding that certified seeds be supplied, so that they could claim compensation for any loss due to low yield.136 quintals of seeds procured for the purpose at Rs. 23.25 a kg from Gurdaspur in PunjabFarmers will be guided on how to treat certified seed potato before sowing"

This is likely to create room for further 25 bps cut in current fiscal"". The CPI inflation had inched up marginally in May to over 5% from 4.87% in the previous month.According to the WPI data released by the government on Monday, vegetable inflation was -5.5%, with potato prices falling by about 52%. Protein-rich items like eggs, meat and fish, too, were cheaper in May as compared to the previous month, and so were milk, fruits, rice and cereals. Overall, food inflation was 3.8%  much lower than the previous few months. The May inflation in manufactured items (food products, sugar, edible oils, beverages) declined by 0.64%  lowest in past many months. Inflation in fuel and power basket was at -10.51% on annual basis, though slightly up from April."
168,‘Sambalpur is the right place for IIM’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150620/jsp/odisha/story_26766.jsp,2015-06-20,Telegraph," Controversy persists over the location of the proposed Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in the state. IIM-Indore had made it clear to the human resource development (HRD) ministry that if the location of the campus was not decided by June 15, it would not begin the admission process for the current academic year. I have no information about the admission process. As sought by the HRD ministry, we have submitted our report on the locations and they have to take the call. Dont you think that the proposed IIM has been the victim of politics between the state and the Centre? Its not politics. They have their terms of references where the IIM should come up. Accordingly, they had decided on a site (in Bhubaneswar). Later, Union HRD minister Smriti Irani sought the views of the state government on the establishment of the IIM in Sambalpur. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik strongly recommended Sambalpur as the location. We have identified three sites for the permanent campus and equal number of sites for the temporary campus. A team is coming on June 25 to assess the ground realities. But people see politics behind States change of stand! Its not at all politics. Who does not want an IIM in Odisha? But its a questionof timing. The central team should come soon and identify the location. Now, they have to take the call. Once they takethe decision, we will fully cooperate with them and see that the institute comes up in the state. We have noticed the fate of Central University in Koraput. Dont you think that the IIM at Sambalpur will also meet similar fate? Sambalpur is developed in all respects. Economic activities in the region have surpassed other parts of the state. There is an industrial corridor and well-built communication system. So Sambalpur is the right location for the IIM. There has also been a demand from Berhampur and other parts to set up the IIM in their respective areas. We have taken the decision to establish the IIM at Sambalpur.  Was it because of pressure from the Centre? No. There is no pressure. The Centre had asked us to explore the possibility of establishing the IIM in Sambalpur andwe did it.  After taking over the employment and the technical education department, you had announced a special recruitment drive, but that is yet to materialise. What went wrong? When I became a minister, I had the ambition to do something good for unemployed youths. We tried to create a platform for all those who could not manage to get jobs through their respective campus recruitments. We have been able to create a database of nearly 41,000 youths, who have registered with us for the special recruitment drive. We have tied up with many companies and going to introduce on-line recruitment for them. It has been alleged that the government charged Rs 100 from each youth for registration of their names. There have been a series of allegations over the last one year. No one looked into the truth behind them. Biju Patnaik University of Technology (BPUT) has formulated a guideline for the special drive. Just let me tell you that for introducing the on-line recruitment, we will be spending Rs 500 on each candidate. Who will pay for that? Its unfortunate that the entire exercise is being painted in a negative manner.  Many engineering colleges have shut down due to lack of students. How will the state government make Odisha a technical education hub? Odisha continues to be a destination for technical education. In eastern India, every one wants to invest in Odisha in the field of technical education because of the transparent government policies. Until recently, the state had three technical colleges, but now there are hundreds of engineering colleges and a number of deemed universities. If the environment is not conducive here, why would people invest their resources in this field? Engineering colleges have not been closed completely but a few subjects that had become redundant in some colleges had been withdrawn. Besides, for running an engineering college, you need to be focused and work hard to make it successful.  It has also been noticed that a large number of engineering seats are going vacant every year. Earlier, there were lapses. We had increased number of seats without assessing the ground realities. The number of students coming fromoutside the state has gone down to a certain extent. A number of controversies are associated with the OJEE. The high court has ordered special JEE this year because the Odisha Professional Education Institutions (Regulation of Admission of Fixation of Fee) Act, 2007, has not been amended. What is your view on this? The matter is in the Supreme Court and sub-judice. The high court had earlier given an order on the issue. The government will abide by whatever the court directs. On the issue of amending the act, I can say the cabinet will take a decision shortly.  Chief minister Naveen Patnaik is reviewing the activities of different departments. On a 10-point scale, how many marks you will give yourself? It is the people of Odisha who will give me marks. The chief minister has assigned us work. In the technical education department, our primary focus is on improving the quality of education and providing a conducive platform for recruitment. In the food supplies department, our job is to take steps to ensure that the farmers get remunerative price for their produce and needy people are guaranteed food security. So I am working in this direction and you, the media, need to assess it.  What is your perception about the chief ministers ongoing review of departments? In the case of technical education, the chief minister has instructed us to make third party assessment of work relating to recruitment and other issues. In the case food supplies, he asked us to strictly enforce the public distribution system and prepare a road map to ensure 100 per cent direct cash transfer to farmers. Steps are being taken for paddy procurement and getting bank accounts for farmers in sixty blocks for online transfers. In the next kharif season, the direct cash transfer system will be extended to another 100 blocks and by 2018, all the blocks will be covered. There has been substantial change in Kalahandi district, once the cause of global embarrassment for India due to its acute poverty. The paddy procurement is highest from Kalahandi. Odisha is now ranked fourth in the country when it comes to surplus paddy.  Over the past one year, shortage of essential food items, particularly potato and onion, has been a major concern. What corrective measures are you taking? Until we have our own production and storage facility, we will remain a consumer state. Now the state government has launched a Potato Mission. Steps are being taken to stepup potato production. We have planned to build 136 cold storages. Work is on to complete 56 cold storages at the moment. Once agriculture production goes up and storage capacity increases, the market conditions will stabilise.  We are also facing problems when it comes to pulses. The prices of dal have skyrocketed. In the case of pulses, we are a consuming state. We are taking steps to encourage the production of pulses. At the national level, there is a need for a uniform tax structure on pulses. The market prices differfrom place to place. Now the Centre is taking steps in this regard. Once an all-India tax structure comes up for pulses, we can have a control on their prices. However, we are keeping a close watch on the price of pulses and strictly enforce laws to check hoarding and black marketing.  The public perception is that the bureaucracy rules the state. You have been a minister for one year. Is the perception true? I have never faced any problem. I can say whatever I want in my two departments, the secretaries have supported me.  You have launched an Odia daily. Does a politician need a newspaper to protect him? It is not necessary. I had wanted for the past three decades to own a newspaper. Even before becoming an MLA, I was editing a magazine. I was editing it for nearly 15 years and it was a huge success."
169,"Delhi: In 10 years, prices of pulses, oil & mutton nearly doubled",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Delhi-In-10-years-prices-of-pulses-oil-mutton-nearly-doubled/articleshow/47808626.cms,2015-06-25,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: In the past 10 years, the prices of many food items seem to have doubled in Delhi. The Economic Survey of Delhi for 2014-15 shows that pulses, oil and even mutton are now twice as costly. Interestingly, Delhi's consumer price index during 2014 at 223 was lesser than the national average of 247, indicating that inflation in Delhi since 2001 has actually been lower than in most other cities.The survey, however, shows that potato and onion have registered an insignificant rise in their wholesale price since 2007 - onion has gone up from Rs 1,107 per quintal to Rs 1,200 per quintal while potato is up from Rs 685 per quintal to Rs 750 per quintal. Against this, the price of pulses has risen exponentially in the wholesale market and its impact has been felt more acutely in the retail market. Arhar has gone up from Rs 3,365 per quintal to Rs 6,400 per quintal while price of moong has risen from Rs 3,784 per quintal to Rs 6,550 per quintal.""Barring seasonal fluctuations in some commodities like onion, potato and wheat - due to decline in arrivals, inclement weather in the major producing areas, transportation bottlenecks, increase in cost of movement and lower stocks - the retail prices of most essential commodities have exhibited a steady trend in all metro cities in India."" It has attributed the rise in prices to low production, market inefficiencies, wastage due to inadequate storage facilities etc.In the case of pulses, Naresh Gupta, president of the grain merchants association, says a change in the minimum supply price has been instrumental in the sharp rise in prices, but more importantly, a shortage in supply is responsible for the rise in the price of grains. ""Moong is the major crop grown in India but the rest is largely imported. The dollar exchange rate has also gone up significantly in the past 10 years. When we have been unable to meet demand, the prices will, of course, rise,"" he said.Kahiq-uz-Zaman Khan, owner of Raj Eggs Mart, says that prices of chicks, medicine, feed etc have risen quite steeply over the past few years, resulting in a rise in the price of eggs."
170,Government creates buffer stock of 9k tonnes of onions,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/Government-creates-buffer-stock-of-9k-tonnes-of-onions/articleshow/47823699.cms,2015-06-26,The Times Of India,"NASHIK: A stitch in time saves nine. This seems to be mantra of the Centre as far as onion procurement is concerned. The government has so far created a buffer stock of around 9,000 metric tonnes of the commodity to ward off any scarcity which usually occurs between August and October every year.The Union government has released Rs 5 crore for the procurement process which is being done though central agencies like National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) under the Price Stability Fund (PCF). The Centre aims to procure 10,000 tonnes of onions by July 10.Speaking to TOI, Pravesh Sharma, managing director of SFAC, said: ""We have set a target of creating buffer stock of 10,000 tonnes of onions to tackle any scarcity in near future. We have already procured 6,500 metric tonnes directly from mandis (agriculture produce market committees) in Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon APMCs in Nashik district and also Indore district. We will be procuring around 3,500 metric tonnes by July 10. The average price at which we have bought the commodity is around Rs 17 to 18 per kilogram.""When contacted, an executive from NAFED said, ""We have procured 2,500 metric tonnes of onions so far from Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon APMCs. We have two godowns at Lasalgaon with a joint storing capacity of 2,500 tonnes of onions. . The onions have been procured at an average rate of Rs 17 per kilogram.""The onions which are currently available in the market were harvested between March and April (summer crop) and have a shelf life of around six months. They last till the fresh kharif crop arrives by September-end. The scarcity is created if this cycle is affected. Hence, August to October is a crucial period with chance of scarcity at its peak. This contributes to spike in prices of the commodity.The Centre has made a provision of Rs 500 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is to be used to advance interest free loans to state governments and central agencies like NAFED and SFAC, to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) considering possibility of the scarcity of onions and rise in prices in future. Initially, the scheme is to be implemented for the current financial year 2015-16 and next financial year 2016-17 for onion and potato commodities."
171,The market comes home,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150628/jsp/calcutta/story_28279.jsp,2015-06-28,Telegraph,"QUICK, CONVENIENT, ECONOMIC  ONLINE GROCERY SHOPPING IS HERE TO STAY Fruits and vegetables? Check. Fish and meat? Check. Rice, dal, spices, cooking oil? Check. Incense sticks for puja room? Check. Shaving foam for the husband? Check. Shower gel for the wife? Check. Chocolate cereals for the kid? Check. Diapers for the baby? Check. Chewies for the puppy? Check. When college friends Pankaj Sharma and Rahul Rai set up an online grocery store two years ago, they were unprepared for the response. The two techies spent all morning driving around the city buying supplies for delivery of their first order at a Salt Lake home. For IT couple Samit and Nikita Bhatia, buying supplies - be it muesli for breakfast, cold cuts for packed lunch or pasta for dinner - online has meant more family time and movie dates on weekends. Nearly a decade after grocery shopping moved from local bazaars to the supermarket, Calcuttans have gone a step ahead, buying everything from diapers to dry fruits and potatoes to pest repellents at the tap of a button. And catering to them are a bunch of young entrepreneurs. The promise: no driving through heavy traffic, no expense of fuel, no parking hassles, no waiting in queue for billing and no lugging back heavy packages. The first step Atanu Ghosh (46) and S. Roy (28) of Salt n Soap were among the first to board the bus in April 2013. With a loyal customer base of more than 10,000, the portal has seen a steady growth over the past two years and continues to record a 20 per cent rise in order volume and value every month. ""We wanted to offer a personalised shopping experience and value for money. For instance, we have a shopping assistant for every customer. We deliver within six hours of placing the order and also have an express delivery system where the goods are delivered within three hours of placing an order,"" Roy said. So, if a customer wants the fish cut in a particular size or realises that he/she missed an item after completing the order, a call to the shopping assistant is all that's needed to solve the problem. Residents of Salt Lake and Rajarhat were among the early customers. ""Initially, most of our orders came from working couples in the IT hub. But now we get orders from all over the city and even the suburbs,"" said Ghosh of Salt n Soap. ""In fact, a large chunk of our customers comprises homemakers."" Forty per cent of orders placed on the portal come from the suburbs, while 70 per cent of its customers are women. Lifeline for the elderly The customer base of the online groceries is not restricted to the city. ""We have customers who have elderly parents living alone in Calcutta or couples in other towns of Bengal whose sons or daughters are studying in the city. We often deliver items at students' hostels,"" said Ghosh, an IIM passout. Brunti Mukherjee, 32, is a senior scientist at Reliance Industries in Mumbai. Every week, she consults her mother over phone and has groceries delivered to her parents' home in Barrackpore. ""My parents are quite aged. They can barely step out of their home. I order groceries for them and pay online from Mumbai. The stuff is delivered within a day. This has been a boon for people like me who have aged parents living away,"" said Brunti, who has been shopping on Just Kirana, another online grocery company, since two years. But the road has not been smooth for Dhiraj Pande, Neha Bajpayee and Aniket Bajpayee, all in their 20s and the brains behind the Burrabazar-based Just Kirana, which caters to Calcutta and Howrah. ""My father and grandfather have been running a kirane ki dukaan (traditional grocery shop) all their life in Burrabazar. But I decided to take it online,"" said Pande. ""When I started off around a year and a half ago, we were this traditional online store where we would deliver goods ourselves. But I realised that was something a lot of other people were also doing. So I came up with the idea of tying up with neighbourhood stores. That has increased our revenue drastically. For instance, earlier we received orders worth around Rs 6,000 a day. Now, it's at least Rs 20,000 a day."" Wide reach Pande has tied up with more than 50 local groceries all over Calcutta. Once an order is placed, the Just Kirana team gets in touch with the nearest registered grocer for delivery and earns a commission on every order. Pankaj Sharma and Rahul Rai, both 28, believe in being hands on. The duo set up Online Grocery Bazaar in 2013 and went to deliver their first order themselves. ""The day was May 1, a state holiday. We were to deliver a bulk order and when the list came in, we realised that we didn't have some of the things that the customer wanted. For most part of the morning, we were driving around the city, buying stuff. We managed to deliver everything by evening. But when we sat down to calculate, we realised that to deliver an order of Rs 3,000, we had ended up spending Rs 3,300,"" laughed Sharma. The duo have come a long way since. With a flurry of orders coming their way, they have hired a garage space near Lake Town, which serves as their storehouse-cum-office. ""We update our stocks with every order that comes in. Now we have a wider variety,"" he said. The portal now gets orders worth Rs 7,000-10,000 every day and bestselling products include lentils, rice and sugar. Sharma, a computer engineer who worked with TCS for five years, often found it difficult to make time for buying essentials. ""I was living with friends and found going to the grocer very irritating. After working hard all week, I wanted to relax on weekends, rather than spend my time buying supplies,"" he said. That's how the idea for Online Grocery Bazaar was born and soon Sharma had college buddy Rai on board. It took a little more than a year to set up business. C for convenience The Bhatias of Beleghata are regular customers of Online Grocery Bazaar. ""We are a working couple and both our offices are in Sector V. We work for 12 hours, at times even longer, from Monday to Friday. Earlier, weekends would be spent buying groceries but now we can sit at home and order and enjoy some leisure time. Just last weekend, my wife and I watched Tanu Weds Manu Returns at the theatre,"" smiled Samit, 33. Shopping online for grocery can be a lifesaver, as Raja Chanda, 32, found out on his birthday. ""Some friends called me up in the morning and announced they were coming home for lunch. My mother was quite annoyed at the short notice and was complaining. That's when I logged on to homegennie.com and ordered whatever she needed. Everything was delivered within a couple of hours. What a relief it was!"" recalled the young businessman. Most online grocery portals arrange for deliveries at a time convenient to the customer. For homemaker Mayuri Sinha, 34, shopping for grocery online is like going on a pleasure trip. ""We shifted to Calcutta from Kharagpur in March. Ever since, I have been shopping for groceries on the Net. In Kharagpur, I would have to go out once a week in the sweltering heat or pouring rain, negotiate traffic snarls, spend more than an hour going through products, wait at the billing counter and then lug the purchases back home. It was a cumbersome process that took up a lot of time and energy. Now, I just make a call or order on the website. I get great discounts, can browse through a variety of products and get quality products delivered - all from the comfort of my home,"" said the Garden Reach resident, who learnt about Salt n Soap from friends and neighbours. Stocks unlimited While most portals stock up on everything from shampoo to spices and broomstick to bacon, Homegennie offers only food items. ""We make sure our food items are clean and pure. All our pulses are hand-cleaned and sorted, so that customer does not need to invest time in sorting them again,"" said Saurov Sanghi, one of the owners. Salt n Soap, Just Kirana and Online Grocery Bazaar have on offer baby products, bath products, cleaning agents, pulses and cereals, spices, readymade food products, jams, sauces and pickles, beverages, milk and milk products, fruits and vegetables, fresh and frozen fish and meat, personal care and hygiene products, pet care items and much more. The road ahead Such is the popularity of online groceries that other e-commerce sites, too, are introducing a section for food and related products too. 365oranges, a shopping portal that specialises in delivering sweets, cakes and cooked food from restaurants, jumped into the bandwagon last month on public demand. ""We had been flooded with requests from our customers asking for a grocery section on the website. We've just started it and are planning to expand. Soon we'll introduce a variety of products,"" said Joy Chatterjee, CEO. On sale at present are fresh fruits and vegetables, rice and pulses. Fish and meat are yet to be introduced. Another city-based shopping portal, Banglalive, has been selling a variety of fresh fish from chitol and chingri to pabda and parshe, besides, fruits and meat in its fresh food section. Bigger players, too, are in the fray. Amazon India finds great potential in the Indian online grocery shopping market, which it feels is still at a ""nascent stage"", particularly for emerging segments such as gourmet, organic food and specialty products. The Gourmet & Specialty Foods store on amazon.in, launched in October, offers a wide variety of treats from confectionaries, condiments, ready mixes to cereals, seasonings and baking supplies for the foodie adventurer. ""We are excited to provide customers across India easy and convenient access to the widest selection of rare culinary ingredients and specialty food products, which may not be easily available in their nearby grocery stores. Amazon's gourmet store brings together over 175 Indian and imported brands. The store also offers a selection of exotic and unusual ingredients used in international cuisines such as Thai, Italian, Mexican and specialty foods such as organic grains, sugar-free, lactose-free and gluten-free products,"" an Amazon spokesperson said, adding that the response has been encouraging. Amazon India's latest innovation, KiranaNow, allows customers to shop for their everyday needs from their local stores on their mobile phone and get them delivered pronto. The pilot project was launched in Bangalore in March through five kirana stores. These stores now listed as sellers on the Amazon platform have uploaded a catalogue of everyday essentials such as staples, spices, snacks, toiletries, baby products, detergent and more. There are plans to move to other metros as well. Do you shop online for groceries? Tell [email protected]"
172,Govt may extend ban on onion hoarding beyond ceiling by 1 year,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/486508/govt-may-extend-ban-onion.html,2015-06-29,Deccan Herald,"Govt may extend ban on onion hoarding beyond ceiling by 1 yearNew Delhi, Jun 29, 2015, (PTI) 21:02 ISTIn order to check price rise of onions, the government may extend by another year the ban on hoarding of the key kitchen staple beyond a prescribed limit.Last year, both onions and potatoes were brought under the purview of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and gave powers to state governments to impose upper limit for holding the stock of these two commodities by individuals and traders.The state governments were given the powers to impose the stock limits on these two commodities and ban hoarding beyond the set ceiling for an year till July 2.""Keeping in view increase in prices of onion, the Consumer Affairs Ministry has moved a Cabinet note for extension of the order that empowers state to fix stock holding limit on onion for one more year. The proposal may come for discussion this week,"" sources said.The proposal aims to enable state governments take effective de-hoarding measures under the Essential Commodities Act and help tackle the problem of rising prices and improve the availability of onion for general public.Other commodities that come under the ambit of stock holding limits are pulses, edible oils, oilseeds, rice and paddy.Apprehending further increase in onion prices in coming days due to supply shortage, the government has already increased the minimum export price of the commodity to USD 425 per tonne and is also planning to import some quantities of onions to boost domestic availability.Prices in both wholesale and retail markets have started increasing due to sluggish supply of good quality onion in the wake of the crop being damaged in storage in major growing states, including Maharashtra.High storage losses are likely to reduce availability of onions in the market and put pressure on prices till the arrival of new kharif crop from mid-September.The country's onion production is estimated to have declined to 189.23 lakh tonnes in the 2014-15 crop year (July -June), as against 194 lakh tonnes in the previous year, as per government data."
173,Farming in India: The past keeps its grip,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/486747/farming-india-past-keeps-its.html,2015-06-30,Deccan Herald,"July 1, 2015, INYT 23:38 ISTMany of India's agricultural practices have barely changed in decades. Reform is long overdue.Nearly a quarter of a century after India launched its first big liberalising reforms in 1991, setting off a new spurt of growth, one area of the countrys economy remains hardly touched: farming.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a 24-hour, state-run television channel for farmers in May, but has fostered no public debate about how to improve Indias dreadfully backward agriculture. This matters.About 600 million Indians, or roughly half the population, depend upon growing crops or rearing animals to survive. Many farming practices, along with Indias agricultural markets, infrastructure, insurance and rules on leasing land, have barely changed in decades. Reform is long overdue.On the surface, things do not look too bad in the countryside. Rural poverty has fallen sharply in the past 15 years. However, this is because services such as selling mobile telephones or motorbikes have boomed across India. It also has helped that previous governments greatly increased welfare spending in the countryside.The productivity of farming itself has been woeful. Contributing only 13.7 per cent to the countrys GDP, agriculture has grown by around 3 per cent a year in recent years, far slower than the rest of the economy.Farmers woes recently have made headlines again. In the spring, unexpected rain damaged northern wheat. A summer heat wave has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly those toiling in fields in the south, as well as hundreds more in Pakistan. A run of farmer suicides has drawn national attention. Official concerns about the monsoon linger: Rains may fall short, for the second year in a row. Since three-fifths of the farmland lacks irrigation, patchy or weak rainfall can spell disaster.Rural incomes already are under strain. One reason is volatile prices: Farmers near Delhi are getting as little as two or three cents per pound of potatoes, a quarter of last years price. Cotton farmers who had prospered from strong exports to China recently have been hit by weaker demand. The government has bought millions of bales to shore up prices.Another reason for lower rural incomes is the decision Modi made a year ago, soon after coming to office, to cut the minimum government-support price for staples, notably wheat and rice. It was the right move, and has helped bring down inflation, but it should have come with more transitional support for farmers hurt by the adjustment. On June 17 a new, only slightly higher minimum price for rice was set for the coming year.Low productivity is a bigger long-term problem. One cause of this is the shrinking size of cultivated plots. As Indias population has expanded, the average plot size has fallen from nearly 5.7 acres in 1970 to less than three acres today. Two grain harvests a year are common, but Indias yields are low by global standards.Productivity also is held down by state laws limiting the amount of farmland a single person may own. Liberalisation would make it easier for abler farmers to consolidate land into bigger, more productive holdings. Even leasing land is famously hard, because strong tenancy rights discourage owners from renting out fields.A newly completed, not-yet-published report for the government on reforming agriculture, led by Ashok Gulati of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations in Delhi, is likely to blame politics. Food inflation upsets voters, so politicians respond to sudden spikes in food prices by imposing national export bans.Regional politicians do something similar. When potato prices soared in West Bengal last year, the state banned traders from shipping potatoes to other states. Amid such uncertainty farmers are disinclined to invest or specialise.Price swings are exacerbated by a 1955 law that bans the storage of large quantities of any of 90 commodities, including onions and wheat. The aim was to deter hoarding, but the effect is to discourage traders or farmers from investing in cold storage and warehouses. As a result, plenty of crops rot before they reach a plate and prices swing erratically. If a bumper crop can neither be exported nor stored, the only way to sell it is to slash prices.Agricultural markets are fractured and distorted. Across much of India, state marketing boards known as Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees restrict trade in fruit and vegetables. A trader in Delhi, for instance, is not allowed to bid for coconuts in Karnataka. It is often easier to import from abroad: The capitals markets are as likely to stock apples from California or New Zealand as from Himachal Pradesh or Kashmir.Markets are even fragmented within states. Arvind Subramanian, the governments chief economic adviser, grumbled that India has between 3,000 and 4,000 separate agriculture markets.Clout of commissioning agentsGangs of local commissioning agents squeeze farmers like ripe mangoes. The mandi, or marketplace, in Azadpur on the edge of Delhi is said to be Asias largest for fruit and vegetables. Enormous trading houses are piled high with garlic and potatoes. Presiding over all are plump agents sporting gold chains.Many are the fourth generation of their family to hold the licence to do the job. They add little value, but admit to taking a hefty 6 per cent commission on sales. In other markets fees are reportedly as high as 14 per cent. Gulati suggested that the international norm for commissions is more like 0.5 per cent. The Delhi government is trying to scrap the local APMCs monopoly, but there is a lack of available land to open a rival marketplace.Many farmers struggle to obtain financing. Agricultural banks are notoriously corrupt. State aid for small farmers is skewed toward providing cheap inputs, by subsidising the provision of fertiliser, water and electricity, rather than, for example, helping to insure farmers crops against bad weather or natural disaster. If it cut the input subsidies, the government could help with insurance or help poor rural folk by simply giving them cash.Too much farming remains under the control of states, and little suggests that the central government wants to shake things up. State leaders, mindful of the conservative rural vote, are not keen either. Farmers would welcome some reforms, such as cutting the power of middlemen, but would resist others, such as lifting ceilings on land holdings.They worry that this would allow them to be pushed off their land by the rich and powerful.In October, a big election is expected in the mostly-rural Bihar. Modi has great ambitions for his Bharatiya Janata Party to win there, and will do nothing to fuel the oppositions claim that his government is against farmers. After that come Assembly in other rural states.Crucial though it is for India to reform its ailing agriculture, such reform will be poss-ible only if politicians find a way to explain how change will actually benefit farmers, not harm them."

The prices of French beans, carrots, tomatoes and potatoes sees a variation of 20-30 across markets in Goa, allegedly due to rain-spoiled vegetables, poor crops and transportations problems, according to vegetable vendors.The prices went up during the last few days and were being sold at varying prices in Panaji, Margao and Mapusa. A survey of the three major markets indicated that the price levels were comparatively lower in Margao market. ""Vegetables are transported by trains till Margao station, whereas other places in Goa get vegetables transported by lorries from Belgaum, and hence cost more,"" explained Menudin Shaikh, a vendor at Panaji market.The price of French beans varied from 40 to 80 per kg; carrots were being sold in the 50-80/kg range, tomatoes at 40-30/kg, cauliflower at 30-60/kg and cluster beans at 40/kg in some of the markets. Limes are priced at 5 each and a bunch of coriander costs 20 with its quantity suffering significantly compared to the last few months.Rising vegetable and fish prices have upset middle and lower class family budgets. The outlets of Goa state horticulture corporation are selling vegetables at reasonable prices and this has helped in regulating prices to an extent. But with a demand that cannot be fulfilled through these few outlets, consumers are forced to head to their nearest vegetable vendors.Despite this hike, the Goa State Horticulture Corporation sells vegetables in its 840 outlets at subsidized fixed rates throughout the state. Orlando Rodrigues, director of Agriculture stated, ""The open market and horticulture corporation outlets have a vast difference in pricing. The government does not question the open market vendors on their pricing, as it's for their personal gains. Also, pricing in the open market may vary from place to place based on the different varieties and sizes each vegetable vendor offers.""Vendors attribute the hike in vegetable prices to a couple of factors. Tushar, a vegetable vendor in the Panaji market said, ""The hike is due to vegetables getting spoilt by early showers and also because of poor transportation facilities. Hence supplies are less and demand more."" Many buyers across the state smugly accept price fluctuations like these. ""Yes, the hike is a lot, but what to do? We need it for daily meals,"" said, Salman Shaikh, a resident of Margao."

The decision will enable state governments take effective de-hoarding measures under the Essential Commodities Act.Though last year consumer affairs ministry had brought both onion and potato under the essential commodities category, only three states - Odisha, West Bengal and Telangana - have so far fixed the stock limit.Sources said that the Cabinet decision to extend the validity has been taken as onion prices in both wholesale and retail markets have started increasing due to less supply of good quality onion. Last month agriculture ministry had informed consumer affairs ministry that the damage of rabi crop would be around 20% due to unseasonal rain and hailstorm.Officials said that high quantity storage losses are likely to reduce availability of onions and would put pressure on prices till the arrival of new kharif crop from mid-September. To prevent the export of onion, last week the government had increased the minimum export price (MEP) of onion to $ 425 per tonne."
176,Keep tabs on pulse stocks: Centre,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Keep-tabs-on-pulse-stocks-Centre/articleshow/47932602.cms,2015-07-04,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: The spiraling prices of tur, moong and urad have prompted the Centre to ask all state governments to strictly implement the stock limit on them to avoid any artificial spike. The average retail price of arhar on Friday was almost 50% higher than that recorded last year, while urad's was 70% higher.The government move is also prompted by the fact that patchy monsoon rains are expected to take a toll on food prices in the month ahead. It also wants to shield consumers from soaring prices of pulses and tame inflationary expectations.The data accessed from the price monitoring cell of consumer affairs ministry shows that arhar was selling at Rs 70 (national average price) on July 3, 2014, while on Friday, the retail price was Rs 106 per kg. In the case of moong dal, the price has shot up from Rs 90 per kg in 2014 to Rs 108. Similarly, urad prices have increased from Rs 67.5 per kg to Rs 108.""There is price rise in some pulses especially tur (arhar), moong and urad. But prices of chana (gram), matar (yellow peas) and masoor dal (red lentils) are stable. There is no point in having a blanket stock limit order on all pulses. So, we will ask states to have no stock limit on the latter three pulses, but to take strict action against hoarders of the other dal items,"" food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.The consumer affairs ministry has convened a meeting of all state food and consumer affairs ministers next week to work out the strategy to check price rise of essential commodities during the festive season. Prices of pulses, onion, potato and tomato usually reach the peak during July-November period and soaring food prices grab headlines.To check price rise, state governments are currently empowered to fix a stock holding limit on pulses and take action against traders if they hoard the stock beyond the prescribed ceiling. Almost all states have fixed stock limits on pulses.Facing a major drop in domestic harvest of pulses  from 19.25 million tonnes in 2013-14 to 17.38 million tonnes in 2014-15  the government has decided to import 5,000 tonnes of arhar and urad each. To avoid any crisis, the government has also approved utilizing part of the corpus kept under price stabilization fund to moderate the prices of pulses and make them available at affordable rate."

179,Rajak price rise jab at Delhi,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150709/jsp/bihar/story_30440.jsp,2015-07-09,Telegraph,"State food and consumer protection department minister Shyam Rajak on Wednesday accused the Centre of only paying lip service when it comes to controlling price rise of essential services. On Tuesday, Rajak attended a conference of state food ministers convened by Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan in Delhi. At the meeting, the Union minister urged the states to crack down on hoarders to check spurt in vegetable and fruit prices in the July-November period. Paswan had also asked the states to act tough against those who sometimes create artificial scarcity of goods such as pulses, edible oils, rice, onion and potato to black market their stocks. The Delhi meeting had also been attended by Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. ""The Centre keeps on lecturing the states but it does nothing to equip them with the necessary powers to crack down on those indulging in hoarding and black marketing. Such appeals sound more ritualistic in nature, else something specific must have been done before expecting the states to check,"" Rajak said on Wednesday. He said the Centre could have taken steps to fix prices of essential commodities and also fix the stock limit for such items so that those found to be violating these rules could be dealt with sternly. ""I raised the same point during the meeting and am iterating it today hoping that something substantial would be done on this front,"" he added. Sources in the state food and consumer protection department said such powers had been vested in the Centre and hence, the state could not do much on its own on this front. Rajak also claimed he had raised a similar point in last year's meeting too and had been assured by the Centre that necessary steps would be taken but nothing had changed. ""This time too, Paswan ji assured me to look into the point I raised during the meeting,"" added Rajak. The BJP, the main opposition party in Bihar, however, appeared unconvinced by Rajak's logic. ""Who has stopped the state government from taking action against hoarders? Rajak is raising this point to hide the inefficiency of his government,"" Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Nand Kishore Yadav said."
180,Rising food prices worry govt,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Rising-food-prices-worry-govt/articleshow/47996846.cms,2015-07-09,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Centre has conveyed its concern over rising prices of key kitchen items to the state governments and has asked them to put their plans in place to augment supply so that prices get stabilized. According to the data made available to the states, prices of items particularly tomato, pulses and onion went up steadily in June in comparison to the corresponding period in 2014.The only relief has been the falling prices of potato. The retail price of potato has fallen by almost 40% over the year.According to consumer affairs ministry data, over a year, both wholesale and retail tomato prices have risen by 43% and 36% respectively. Sources said the prices may go up in the near future as there is little scope of increase in supply of tomatoes during the festive season. ""Though this item cannot be stored for long, traders may push prices artificially. States have to ensure traders don't exploit the situation,"" said a central government official.Even the average wholesale and retail prices of onion showed a rise of 21% and 19.5% over a month and by 12.6% and 10% over a year respectively. According to government reports, the total onion production during 2014-15 was 18.9 million tonnes (MTs) against 19.4 MTs in the previous financial year. ""The available stock of 40 lakh tonnes cannot be maintained for a longer period due to high moisture content, which could impact prices during the latter part of lean season - August and October,"" mentioned the agenda that was circulated by consumer affairs ministry to state representatives on Tuesday.The ministry has told state governments that the maximum price rise has been witnessed in case of pulses. The average retail prices of all varieties of pulses except moong dal has increased over the past one year gram dal went up by 35.9% while arhar rose by 40.5% and urad has increased by 43%. Moong dal and masoor dal have also shot up by 16% and 27% respectively.The chief reason behind shooting prices of pulses has been the reduction in domestic production - from 19.25 million tonnes in 2013-14 to 17.38 million tonnes in 2014-15.The action plan to deal with situation that has been agreed by the states include sustained action against hoarding and black-marketing, identifying vulnerable areas where supply shortages occur and ensure that ""stock-out"" situations do not occur especially of items of common consumption.States have also been asked to mobilize existing storage capacity to ensure adequate decentralized stocks are maintained and to tap corporations, cooperative societies and fair price shops for augmenting distribution avenues for essential food items. Centre has asked them to establish price monitoring cells to monitor the prices of these specific commodities."
181,‘A combination of fresh and processed food is not harmful’,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/A-combination-of-fresh-and-processed-food-is-not-harmful/articleshow/48036510.cms,2015-07-12,The Times Of India,"NAGPUR: The biggest irony of our times is that we tend to overeat and yet are undernourished. Not only that, as the Maggi controversy has shown, much of the food we eat can be downright dangerous. While occasionally indulging in junk food, street food and fast food is only human, their unregulated consumption can lead to a laundry list of life-threatening ailments such as obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. As more and more ill-effects of such foods come to fore, there is a slow but definite shift towards healthy eating again.But how to determine if a particular food is suitable for one's lifestyle and dietary requirements? TOI spoke to former professor and head of food technology department at Laxminarayan Institute of Technology Pratima Shastri on a variety of issues about eating habits, packaged food, and traditional food. Excerpts from an interview:A. Any consumer should look for the following things on the label:* Date of packaging and date of expiry or best before* Mode of storage after unpacking, like refrigerator, closed box etc* Any special health claims* Nutritive value - whether it is per 100 gm or per portion? What is the regular serving size per portion?* What changes are expected when the item is used as an ingredient in another food, especially when dry ingredients like flours are used in chapatti, paratha or upma, the actual nutritive value of final product will be different.* How the nutritive value of the purchased item could be enhanced at home by adding fresh items (farsan+sev+onion+coriander and tamarind chutney in a good combination)* Watch the portion size while enjoying junk food. Consuming a large portion of an unhealthy food is that much worse. For example, for some potato chips, the recommend portion size as 14g, which is only 10 chips, but who can stop finishing a 75g packet once it is opened?A. Form a habit of reading the labels on the food packets. You can find out the 'junkness' value of the food in six steps:STEP 1: Find out the total calories, proteins and fats per 100g of food, or in one serving of the food. Any food providing more than 550 calories per 100g is likely to be junk food.STEP 2: Watch for the fat content. Any food with more than 30% fat is likely to contribute more than 30% calories from fat. Regular consumption of such foods leads to obesity.STEP 3: Note the protein content. Food with more than 7% proteins provides enough proportion of protein calories. Foods with more than 15% proteins can be combined with high carbohydrate foods to achieve balance.STEP 4: Watch the label for saturated fats, trans fat content and PUFA content. Saturated and trans fats are bad fats, while unsaturated fats indicated by PUFA are good fats.STEP 5: Find out the salt content. Salt content in one serving should not exceed 2g, that is one-third of the recommended intake of 6g a day.STEP 6: Note the list of additives and preservatives. Safety of permitted additives and preservatives is based on the assumption of specific intake but that is never mentioned on the labelA. Preservatives like salts and spices and chemical additives like stabilizers, colours, flavours, binding and gelling agents which put pressure on liver and kidneys are harmful. Ajinomoto or Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), a flavour enhancer added in Chinese food is responsible for the Chinese restaurant syndrome with causes symptoms like headache, dizziness, nausea and lack of concentration. These are present in permitted quantities. But consumption of more quantity of packaged food would naturally cross the quantity of permitted limits.A. Not really, if consumed once in a while. A combination of fresh and processed food is not harmful. In fact, packaging and processing adds to convenience and is expected to be free of adulterants, hygienic and durable, but all this comes at a cost. We should draw a line between fresh foods and packaged foods. In fact, there is a concept of a 'food mile' which means the more the food has travelled from its place of manufacturing, the more it will cost and the more harmful it would be. This is because its nutrient levels keep decreasing the longer it takes to be transported, especially frozen foods. The transportation adds to environmental costs. Hence ideally, even processed food should be bought from local manufacturers.A. The effect is generally gradual but depends o various factors. Effects like obesity, hypertension, osteoporosis or weakening of bones develop slowly and are many of these effects are irreversible.A. Those which are free from additives as packaging avoids adulteration. For instance, packaged milk is better than loose milk.A. The effect of naturally occurring harmful elements can be removed by processes like germination of grains or sprouting, soaking in water or fermentation which are used conventionally in traditional food cooking.A. Yes, some ingredients effect the development of children.Q. How does one determine one's eating habits in modern times (take doctor's advice, read health magazines, consult friends, go by advertisements etc)?A. Self awareness. Basically there are four types of consumers- Not bothered, Ad addicts (believe that advertisements are truth as they are endorsed by their favourite celebrities, Nostalgic (feel everything was very good in old days-25 years ago and is bad now), Suspicious (everything is wrong) and Balanced (who consider all aspects, collect information and then take decisions). Balanced persons are best.Q. How does one know he/she is eating healthy?A. There is a five-point guide to healthy eating:* WHO: Every person has different needs. What is wholesome for a sports person may not be wholesome for a senior citizen.* WHERE: Climate and geographical availability of food items affects their suitability. What could be healthy in north-east India couldn't be so in South India.* WHEN: Eating a snack at the time of meal or irregular meal timings are not healthy.* WHY: Eating for hunger is healthy but craving for it is not healthy. Avoiding food when hungry is also wrong.* HOW MUCH: Small quantity of junk food is not bad, but the quantity and frequency needs to be watched.Everybody should take a second to weigh the advantage of saving time against losing precious health in the long run. Do not replace regular meals with junk food. If necessity arises, select proper combination of snacks which are wholesome and healthy. Poha, sabudana khichadi, idli and sandwich are among top ten healthy breakfast items."

The rates of inflation were (-)9.7 percent for petrol, (-)11.86 percent for high-speed diesel and (-)4.73 percent for cooking gas.Commenting on the data, Confederation of Indian Industry director general Chandrajit Banerjee said: ""The near static price line and benign inflation outlook should propel the RBI to continue with its rate easing cycle in its forthcoming monetary policy to support investment and consumption demand especially as industrial production has recorded a muted performance and the consumer goods sector has moved into the negative terrain in May.""PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry Alok B.Shriram said: ""Subdued wholesale price inflation will help manufacturing sector in terms of increased price cost margins vis-a-vis decreased cost of raw materials.""Regarding pulses and onions that continued to remain costly, he said the ""government needs to check the rising prices of pulses and take adequate steps in advance so that prices of pulses are in comfortable trajectory in the coming times"".""We urge the RBI to reduce the repo rate at least by 50 basis points in the forthcoming credit policy and another 100 points by end 2015,"" he added.FICCI president Jyotsna Suri said: ""There is a critical need to firm up industrial growth. We hope that the Reserve Bank would maintain its accommodative stance in the third bi-monthly statement for 2015-16 to be announced next month.""Welcoming the downtrend in WPI, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) said that a long term sequential drop in inflation of manufacturing products does not augur well for manufacturers as it could adversely impact their pricing power.""With prices seemingly under control, the central government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should focus more on boosting the economic growth,"" said secretary general D.S. Rawat."

Price of arhar has increased by nearly Rs 30 per kg across Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata in comparison to the prices of last year.The biggest shocker has been the increase in prices of urad. Comparative analysis of the prices of black dal shows how per kg price increase has been over Rs 30 on Monday against the prevailing prices on July 13 a year back.""We will soon approve the prices at which arhar will be imported. Prices prevailing in Myanmar is higher in comparison to Malawi. Once the government import happens it will have some impact on the market. We will provide this quantity to states and it will be up to them to make it available at affordable prices of people,"" a government official privy to the developments said.The government expects to utilize about Rs 35 crore for import of arhar and another 5,000 tonnes of urad dal. This amount will be spent from the Rs 500-crore corpus dedicated for the purpose of stabilizing prices of essential commodities including pulses, onion and potato.So far only private players had been importing pulses from producer countries. But this year the government took a decision to buy a considerable quantity of the key kitchen item as a market intervention measure.Sources said the tenders for urad will be out soon so that the fresh supply can be made available to states.Meanwhile, prices of all other pulses including chana, moong and masoor have also increased significantly over the past year. Pulses production is estimated to fall to 18.43 million tonnes in the 2014-15 crop year (June-July) from 19.78 million tonnes in the previous year. This has been the main concern for government.India produces 18-20 million tonnes of pulses annually and imports 3-4 million tonnes to meet the domestic demand.TOI has learnt that government believes that potato prices will be stable, while onion prices can be cause for worry this year. ""We have sanctioned Rs 10 crore for procurement and import of the two items. If there is a need, necessary steps would be taken,"" said a government official."

Starting from paddy, including basmati, in the previous kharif season to the rabi season that has just ended, it was the worst crop year for farmers of Punjab. Other main crops - potato, maize, cotton, kinnow and sugarcane - also failed, leading to losses for farmers.With paddy transplantation in the current kharif season getting over, farmers have begun worrying about the ensuing rabi season (2015-16) as there are fears that the state is headed for wheat seed shortage.""The poor remuneration for crops during the past one year has hit farmers hard. It is seen as the main reason for suicides by them though this is still to be confirmed by a government agency,"" said joint director, state agriculture department, BS Sohal.He said farm experts were also in a fix. ""We are telling farmers to grow crops to the best of their knowledge. All stakeholders need to play a proactive role to save agriculture in Punjab,"" Sohal said.Redundant varieties posing challengeVarieties of crops getting redundant is emerging as a challenge for the experts.Sugarcane crop, for instance, has failed in Punjab as variety COJ 64 grown successfully for two decades in the state now lacks lustre and is no longer as productive as it was. ""In the absence of a better variety, sugarcane in Punjab is not able to match cane grown in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra,"" said Punjab Sugarfed general manager MP Singh.The Punjab government is trying to find a way out in the absence of a better cane variety. ""We are coming up with drip irrigation for sugarcane that should help increase productivity,"" said Punjab financial commissioner (cooperation) SK Sandhu.Similarly, farmers have sought better varieties of wheat and paddy, especially basmati. ""Farmers prefer short-duration varieties as they consume less water, involve less input cost and are exposed to vagaries of weather for a shorter duration,"" Sohal said.""The commonly sown wheat variety, HD2967, is no longer resistant to Karnal bunt and yellow rust diseases despite 80% of area sown in the previous rabi season. We are planning to ask farmers to grow HD3086 and HD1105 varieties in the next season,"" said Punjab agro-industries corporation managing director KS Pannu.No relief mechanism, dependence on CentreThere is no practical mechanism to support farmers in case the crop fetches lower price or production falls due to bad weather or if there is an increase in input cost.Due to drought in the previous kharif season, farmers and the state government had to pump in additional cost to irrigate fields due to poor rains. The state government demanded Rs 2,330 crore from the Centre as compensation but received a meagre Rs 78 crore.Chief minister Badal shifted the onus on the Centre last Sunday when he said the state government couldn't do much for farmers as major policy decisions for the agri-sector such as the minimum support rice (MSP) and bonus were in the purview of the central government.""The Centre should have given bonus (over and above the MSP) on wheat due to the drastic fall in productivity this season,"" said PS Rangi, consultant with the Punjab State Farmers Commission. He said all crops, including basmati, potato, maize, cotton, kinnow and sugarcane, had suffered and farmers were getting less price but there was no way to support them.State cooperative bank chairman Avtar Singh Zira said farmers were trying to survive on easy term loan on 4% annual interest offered by the state cooperative bank. ""But for how long? Debt is a sweet poison. What will happen when subsequent crops fail? The farmer will be caught in a trap and it will become difficult for him to repay the loan,"" Zira said. He suggested a crop insurance policy with assured compensation.Contract farmers the worst hitDue to the fall in remuneration of subsequent crops, the farmers doing agriculture on contract have suffered the most. ""The contract farmer pays the lease amount of about Rs 40,000 per acre in advance to land owners,"" said Rangi. About 40% farmers are engaged in contract farming in the state. The rural development department has also reduced the contract amount being offered on panchayat land.Fall in commodities market adds to woesPrices of wheat and maize have fallen by 33% and 29%, respectively, in the international market in one year alone. Similarly, cotton and sugar prices also crashed by 22% and 25%, respectively.Experts say the impact is seen in India too, leading to a volatile commodities market.How crops failed Punjab's farmerPaddy: In the kharif season of 2014, farmers suffered due to drought as there was an increase in input cost by 15% to 20%. The procurement slowed down as the Centre delayed the cash credit limit for buying paddy.Basmati: In the kharif season of 2014, the prices of basmati crashed to Rs 2,900 per quintal, which even sold at double the price in the previous year. This kharif season has area under basmati reduced to half in Patiala district and it would fall in the entire state. Prices are expected to fall with stocks of the previous season yet to be lifted.Potato: There was a glut leading to losses. The input cost was Rs 25,000 per acre but potatoes were sold for Rs 3-4 a kg, making it impossible for farmers to recover the cost. Rain in February delayed harvesting. Sown over 87,000 hectares in the previous year, now farmers are not keen on the crop.Maize: Maize with an MSP of Rs 1,352 a quintal sold at Rs 1,200, while undried maize could only fetch Rs 675 a quintal. Markfed, the nodal agency for procuring maize, is not fulfilling the state government's mandate. Maize is the best alternative to paddy.Cotton: The crop suffered due to untimely rains in the picking season of September-October. The model (average) price crashed and sold between Rs 3,200 and Rs 4,130 per quintal for American cotton and between Rs 4,300 and Rs 4,950 for desi cotton against previous year's rate of Rs 6,000 per quintal. The area under cotton was 4.2 lakh hectares but this is also expected to come down. The input cost has increased as BT varieties are getting resistant to pests.Kinnow: It could fetch Rs 8-Rs 9 a kg against the previous rate of Rs 10. ""This fall is huge for the farmer as the input cost is also increasing,"" said director, horticulture, Gurkanwal Singh. He said that kinnow growers formed 35% of farmers who had shifted to protected farming.Sugarcane: Farmers are already awaiting payment of Rs 413 crore. The common variety of COJ64 has stopped giving optimum output. Cane yield over the years has come down by 700 quintals per hectare. About 94,000 hectares is under cultivation. Since sugar prices are less than sugarcane prices, the mills can't afford payment to farmers. The state government is clearing the backlog by releasing quarterly installments of Rs 50 crore.Wheat: There has been a steep fall in wheat production this year by 20%. The crop withered under the vagaries of the unpredictable weather. It rained when the crop was at the maturing stage and led to fall in yield and quality of grain.Experts speakDouble whammy for farmersIt is a double squeeze for farmers. The terms of trade are against agriculture. There has been a steep rise in machinery cost, labour and diesel but increase in wheat-paddy MSP has been meagre.PS Rangi, Punjab State Farmers' Commission consultantWeather played truantBad weather during the entire year added to woes of farmers. Punjab's farmers are under stressPunjab agriculture commissioner BS SidhuProactive research neededThe crop cycle in last two years has been hit. We need to shift to shorter-duration crop varieties. Our university has to play a proactive role in research for which we need more funds. More than crop insurance we need the non-agriculture sector to support the farm sector. Other sectors are progressing, not agriculture, while they are responsible for climatic changes. Why should only the farmer suffer?BS Dhillon, Punjab Agricultural University vice-chancellor"
187,HC prod to govt on potato price,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150718/jsp/bengal/story_32326.jsp,2015-07-18,Telegraph,"Calcutta, July 17: A Calcutta High Court division bench headed by Chief Justice Manjula Chellur today directed the state government to frame a policy to ensure that farmers get proper price for potato and other vegetables irrespective of the quantum of harvest. According to the directive, the government has to set up a committee including one representative each of the agricultural marketing department and Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya and an economist with expertise in the field. ""The expert committee members will have to ensure that the farmers producing potato and other vegetables can get fair price even after large-scale production,"" Justice Joymalya Bagchi, the other judge on the bench, said. The order followed a public interest litigation (PIL) by advocate Rabishankar Chatterjee, who had alleged that as the state had failed to frame a practical policy, potato growers were not getting adequate price. Several economists have questioned the rationale behind government intervention in the potato market as farmers often produce the tuber in large quantities to get high returns on investments. An assurance from the government that it would ensure proper price may act as a disincentive for farmers while planning to produce keeping in mind market realities, an economist who did not wish to be named said. Chatterjee had moved the PIL a few months ago after at least 18 potato farmers committed suicide allegedly because of failure to get the proper price for their produce. The problem over production of potato intensified this year as farmers were forced to go for distress sale owing to lack of demand. In Bengal, the total production of potato was 105 lakh tonnes this year, about 10 lakh tonnes more than its average yearly production. In addition to the surplus production, a blanket ban on export of the produce in the past two years by the state government had prevented traders from storing large stocks of potato, bringing down demand. Today, the chief justice said there should be a fixed scheme so that farmers get adequate price for potato and other vegetables. ""If we have to frame a policy to ensure proper price for potato and other vegetables, we have to announce a minimum support price. If the market rate is lower than the MSP, the government will have to buy the produce. I don't know how this is possible for a cash-strapped state like Bengal,"" an official said."

No farmer will commit suicide if you provide him with adequate water and remunerative price for our produce, said a leader of farmers during an interactive session with Prakash Kammaradi, chairman of the Karnataka State Agriculture Price Commission, who visited Kuruvanka, a village in Channarayapatna taluk.Dr. Kammaradi visited the families of farmers who had committed suicide in the last two months in the district.Thimme Gowda of Kuruvanka committed suicide on July 7. After meeting the victims family members, he interacted with farmers of the village. Dharmesh, a farmer, said that for several years, the residents of the village had been demanding irrigation facility. An underground canal that carries water from the Hemavati to Tumakuru district passes very close to Kuruvanka. If we had sufficient water, Thimme Gowda would not have dug five borewells in five years and suffered financial losses, which incidentally drove him to take the extreme step, he said.Girish, a former gram panchayat member, said irregular supply of power was a major reason for farmers to commit suicide. Our borewells have dried up. We have not been able lift water from the borewells that are providing water, because of irregular power supply. Thimme Gowda had cultivated banana crop in his two acres of land and suffered loss due to lack of of water, he said.When Dr. Kammaradi enquired whether farmers were aware of crop insurance schemes, many farmers replied in the negative. A few expressed disappointment over the insurance scheme as it was not comprehensive. Kasaba hobli in the taluk had not been included in the list for covering potato with crop insurance.Addressing the farmers, the chairman said he would meet with the officials concerned about the farmers demands. He called upon the KSRC of Raitha Sangha to spread awareness about crop insurance scheme among farmers."

""The wholesale prices have gone up by 10%-20%. But the retailers are making a killing in the name of short supply. Even the big retail chains are pricing the vegetables double or triple the wholesale price,"" he added.Kriplani said increase in vegetable prices during the rainy season is common. ""Due to heavy rains, vegetables get damaged. This causes shortage of supplies as compared to the demand, thus, causing increase in prices. This is going to continue for a month at least,"" he said.Data shows the average price of onion in the wholesale market at the beginning of the month (July 1) was Rs 16 per kg but now it has gone up to Rs 18 per kg. The price of pointed gourd (parval) and ladies' fingers have gone up from Rs 14 per kg to Rs 22.50 per kg and Rs 11 to Rs 15 per kg respectively.TOI visited major retail chains and roadside vendors to find that they were selling the vegetables at even higher price, thus looting the customers. One supermarket in Kailash Colony sold onions at Rs 40 per kg when the wholesale price is Rs 17 kg. Similarly, tomatoes, cucumbers, bottle gourds and other vegetables were being sold with huge profit margins.""I went to buy some vegetables on Sunday but returned with potatoes and onions only.

Potato rates are at an all-time low, thanks to a major glut in Uttar Pradesh  the main production centre in country. Potatoes are in the range of Rs 12-15 a kg in the retail markets, which is one-fourth of last year's levels.Unseasonal rains in various pockets of the country during May hit the onion-growing regions hard.

The rally in prices of the dal  up by over 33 per cent from the corresponding period last year  started in May, when it crossed the Rs.100-mark in the wholesale market.Crop loss in major pulses-growing areas is being cited as the reason for the steep increase. For instance, Kalaburagi, known as the red gram bowl of south India, witnessed a steep fall in the yield last year and is now being reflected in the retail market. The crop suffered due to poor rainfall in the beginning of the season, and excess rain, accompanied by hailstorm, during the crucial period of flowering.Pinching your pocket further are vegetables.

Large areas under cultivation, especially potato cultivation, in upland areas of the region, known as the vegetable bowl of the State, have been affected. Supply from the regions plays a major role in controlling the prices in the Onam market.The authorities had expected a bumper crop this time as vast areas, which were under grandis cultivation earlier, were brought under potato cultivation.P.T.

Muthuraj, a potato farmer, said that it was the low groundwater level in the upland areas that had led to crop loss of potatoes. There was not much damage on the lowland areas.A Krishi Bhavan official said that nearly 100 tonnes of vegetables were being sent to various markets from Vattavada daily and the prices were also better."

In this season, however, the main demand is fulfilled by onions from Nasik, which has been damaged by rain in Maharashtra, which has led to an increase in price.A trader from Sector 26 market, Deepak Kumar, said, ""Best quality onions come from Nasik and Rajasthan and both the states have received heavy rain, which have damaged onion crop. Onions from Nasik would earlier fall in the price bracket of Rs 20-25/kg, but are now coming for Rs 35-40/kg. Price of Rajasthan onions has gone up from Rs 16-18/kg to Rs 22-26/kg.

""He doesn't like it,"" she says.Other mothers in the locality say it is the same with their children - they don't like the packaged food due to its ""bad taste"" and also the fact that it looks strange to them.The irony is that, despite the Centre's directive to the state government to not force tribal children to eat something that looks alien to them but gives them locally produced food, the state authorities have declined to budge.The result: costly packaged food meant for enriching the platter of tribal children with nutrients is ending up in cattle and goat sheds.Minors continue to eat the boiled rice and potato - their staple food - that lacks the nutrients and calories a growing child requires.Experts point that this vicious cycle is eventually leading minor children from the tribal society to their graves, a fact confirmed by official data.

Godda is even worse with 76.Balram Joe, advisor on food to the commissioner, Supreme Court, said, ""We will move the high court to ban the packaged food. There is no check on quality apart from the bad taste.""he added that the SC has been considering multiple reports of 'ready to use therapeutic food (RUTF)' being rejected by locals, and how it had become a profitable business for private companies.""Jharkhand has been asked by the Centre not to experiement with RUTF and the state government is yet to act.""Jharkhand's miracle RUTF comis in 900-gram packets, and is given to children between six months to 3 years. Each packet contains a mix of flour, soya nuggets and pulses. ""Cooking the packed food in boiling water results in a brown cake. But the children still do not like it,"" says Sita Pahariya, in Godda's Dangapara village.""We throw the brownish cake away and instead give them our own home cooked food.""Member of the Right to Food campaign, Dhiraj Kumar said that ""Tribals have their own food habits. Suddenly changing it to something not in their diet is not a viable option. Rejection is obvious.""""We have been asking the state to give them local produce which is nutritious and has been in their regular platter.""The social welfare department has received around 300 complaints from across Jharkhand over children rejecting RUTF.Principal Secretary Social Welfare Department, Binay Kumar Choubey said that ""There have been complaints. Give me a week and I will have the full report.""The rejection of the RUTF comes in Jharkhand where 47% of children under the age of 5 are stunted and 42% are underweight as per the UNICEF-India's Rapid Survey on Children 2013-14."

Hundreds of farmers, who have spent over Rs. 30,000 an acre on the cultivation of potato, are in distress as they are not sure of getting their costs in return.Manjula of Mosale Thimmanahalli in Hassan taluk has cultivated potato in her 20 guntas of land. I have sown five bags of seeds of 60 kg. each with the hope of getting an yield of at least 20 bags. Now, I am not sure of getting even five bags, given the condition of the crop, she said. She had purchased the seeds for sowing at Rs.1,200 a bag in May this year. The potato crop in the land adjacent to her farm was completely lost due to late blight. Moreover, the crop in her farm was also affected by the disease, recently. The fungal infection makes the plants dry, which will result in the loss of entire crop.This year, potato has been cultivated in 15,460 hectares of land in Hassan district. The Horticulture Department has received reports of crops being infected from late blight disease from all the taluks in the district. Besides, Hassan district received an average of 377 mm rainfall between June 1 and August 5 this year, against the annual normal of 420 mm for the period. The shortfall in rainfall has only compounded the problem for farmers.The traces of late blight were noticed in some parts of Hassan and Arkalgudu taluks in June itself. The officials of Horticulture Department distributed pamphlets among growers, suggesting them to administer certain medicines to avoid their crops from getting infected by the disease. The late blight disease has been surfacing in Hassan district for the last six to seven years. Medicines suggested by the Horticulture Department have not been effective, so far, in checking its spread. It is a three-month crop. Even if the plants survive for 70 days and there is adequate rainfall, then we dont have to worry about the yield. If the crop gets affected by the disease even after 70 days, we will get medium potato tubers. But this time, we have neither rainfall, nor are the crops health, said Siddaramesh of Hariharpur in Holenarasipur taluk.Farmers have cultivated potato in about 15,460 hectares of land across Hassan districtLate blight disease first surfaced in some parts of Hassan and Arkalgud taluks in June"
201,Maharashtra gets ready for advanced Rabi season,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-gets-ready-for-advanced-rabi-season/,2015-08-06,Indian Express,"The revival of rains in the first week of August is likely to set the stage for an advanced Rabi season across Maharashtra. Instead of going for resowing of Kharif mid-August, farmers have decided to straightaway go for Rabi crops. The Rabi season starts from October-end, which also is the onset of winter.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis held a meeting with district collectors across the state Wednesday to review the rainfall and crop pattern. While there are still serious concerns over poor rainfall in the three districts of Latur, Osmanabad and Beed in Marathwada region, the prolonged monsoon predicted by IMD has revived the hopes of sustainable water tables.Initial reports suggest farmers are unlikely to adopt dobar perni (resowing of Kharif crops), a senior officer told The Indian Express.The reports from almost all districts say farmers are set to advance the sowing of Rabi crops to the end of August or early September. Rabi crops are sown in winter and harvested in spring. The main crops are wheat, barley, sesame, mustard, peas, maize, linseed, gram, cumin, onion, tomato, potato and oat.Usually, Kharif sowing ends by the end of June or the beginning of July. After the initial good rains this year, farmers across the state had undertaken Kharif sowing, but a long dry spell stretched over 25 to 45 days led to crop damage. The scarcity of water badly affected the cultivation across Maharahstra.During his marathon interaction with district collectors Wednesday, Fadnavis issued directives to expedite the ongoing Jalyukta Shivar water conservation programmes in drought-hit villages. Out of the states total 40,000 villages, 25,000 come in the category of drought affected.Sources in the Ministry of Agriculture said there had been 60 per cent Kharif sowing in the state, with the rest of the farmers waiting for sustained rainfall before making huge investments.Anticipating a crisis, the government had kept a contingency plan ready to lend help to farmers by making provisions for seeds and fertilisers if they had to resow crops.The state has also started cloud seeding experiment in parts of Marathwada. Even as Agriculture Minister Eknath Khadse is monitoring the experiment undertaken in Aurangabad and Latur districts, preliminary reports are not very satisfactory.The cloud seeding experiment held last week at Yevala in Nashik failed.Sources in the agriculture ministry said the purpose of the project was to make a last-ditch attempt to bring rains and salvage by mid-August the Kharif cultivation to some extent.CM, Gov discuss irrigation projectsThe state government has sought the approval of Governor C Vidyasagar Rao to allow the corporations to go ahead with irrigation projects, which were held back following revised administrative approval.The government has decided to relax the guidelines  with the governors nod  to expedite the irrigation projects in the backward districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada. Despite allocation of funds in some cotton growing belts the project made no headway pending consent.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, along with his Cabinet ministers, held a meeting with the governor at Raj Bhawan late Wednesday night. The other ministers present were Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar and Water Resources Minister Girish Mahajan among others.A senior minister said, We urged him to allow us to give consent to respective corporations to take up irrigation works that were struck due to revised administrative approval, following escalation of cost and other related aspects.The government explained how 32 irrigation projects should be expedited to enhance the irrigation potential in Vidarbha, Marathwada and part of North Maharashtra.ENSFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Picture by Abir IslamLabhpur, Aug. 5: They fished in troubled waters, but used the situation to their advantage. Many farmers in several Birbhum villages whose monsoon paddy has been damaged because of the floods have cast their nets on the swollen rivers to become fishermen by the day. Although they are not getting the expected catch for not being professional fishermen, the farmers of Labhpur, Sainthia and Rampurhat blocks have been taking home anything between Rs 100 and Rs 200 each by the end their sale at local markets on higher ground. Their catch includes rohu, katla and boal. The varieties of fish, which on any other day would fetch between Rs 200-300 a kilo in the market, are being sold dirt-cheap because of their easy availability following the floods. Farmer Uttam Bagdi, whose paddy on two acres was damaged, have been getting up around 4 in the morning every day as usual. But instead of the spade that he took to the field, he has been carrying a fishing net that he borrowed from a neighbour. ""I lost my crop in the floods and the Rs 6,000 I had invested in seeds and fertilizers. But I cannot leave my family alone, I have to sustain them. So, I took to fishing, like many other farmers,"" Bagdi said. According to the farmer, those who have taken to fishing for the time-being are sharing the limited number of nets available in their village. If some fish by the day, others do it later. ""Were we fishermen by profession, we would have caught a lot more. I am earning between Rs 100-200 every day by selling fish. People too are not willing to pay the actual price for the rohu and katla I am selling as a lot more is available in the market now,"" said the farmer, who has shifted to a local school with his family since Saturday. He added: ""We are getting cooked food at the flood shelter but I need to earn money so that I can sustain my family after the waters recede. Many other farmers from my village have started catching fish for a living."" The daily income for Uttam and the others hasn't had much of a difference though. Several farmers this correspondent spoke to in Birbhum said they earned around Rs 85,000 a year, which turns out to be around Rs 200 daily. Sentu Mondal, a resident of Dangapara village whose paddy on an acre is under water, has taken to fishing too. But unlike Uttam, Sentu could return home from a flood shelter on Monday night after the waters receded. ""We were given 2 kilos of rice and potatoes two days ago. The relief will stop once the floods are over. So, I need money to make both ends meet. My crop has been lost but I have to feed my family. Yesterday, I earned Rs 100 by selling fish,"" Sentu said. Pradip Mondal, the deputy director of agriculture in Birbhum, said: ""The chief minister asked for reports on crop loss. We will compensate the farmers. But the package is yet to be worked out."""
203,Falling prices: Protesting growers to distribute potatoes for free today,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/falling-prices-protesting-growers-to-distribute-potatoes-for-free-today/,2015-08-07,Indian Express,"After three seasons of excellent prices for their crop, potato growers of the state are now facing a glut of the crop with no demand in local markets and other states. As a result, whole-sale prices have plumeted to an all-time low of Rs 160 to Rs 250 per quintal.The potato growers have now decided to distribute the crop for free at Jalandhar on Friday, to protest, what they termed the governments apathy to their plight and retailers reluctance to streamline prices.The growers claim that potato consumption has reduced considerable this season because retailers are not lowering prices despite whole-sale prices falling to an all-time low. They also point to a glut in potato production in other key growing states including West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat.The situation is a far cry from the previous three seasons when farmers earned between Rs 3,000 to 4,000 per quintal in the whole-sale markets.The growers say that this season they have to contend with higher cold storage costs. We are spend Rs 100 for every 50-kg bag in cold stores but the same bags fetch us between Rs 80 and Rs 125, said the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary JS Sangha. We are left with no option but to either dump the crop on the roads as we cant bear the cost of keeping them in cold stores or give them to consumers for free, he said, adding that retail prices must be lowered as consumers will not buy the crop for Rs 15 to Rs 20 a kilo.The growers also said that the state government hasnt come to their aid. There is huge demand for potato in Russia and the middle-east countries but farmers alone cannot do anything as there must be a policy at the government-level to prevent farmers from being fleeced, Sangha said.We had exported potato at Rs 900 per quintal to Russia a couple of years ago with the governments help but there was some major problem, he addedFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The average grade remained at Rs 50 in neighbourhood bazaars or vegetable carts. This is a hike of Rs 10 a kg since last week when best grades were being sold for Rs 50 and medium varieties were in the range of Rs 35 to 40kg.Wholesalers expect the rates may finally start receding from Monday. The benchmark wholesale prices remained static at Rs 37.5 a kg throughout the week though it went up on the retail side. High prices have taken a toll on the demand. Even the offtake of onions from the bulk market at Kalamna is as low as the arrivals. ""Since the middlemen have been left with stock to be carried forward for the next week's session, it is expected prices may come down,"" said Jaiprakash Wasani of M/s Pankaj Trading Co at Kalamna.Wasani said the government had started importing onions from China and Pakistan to bridge the demand-supply gap in the country. However, the quality is not expected to be up to the mark. ""Instead the government can directly subsidize the cost of purchasing onions to persons below poverty line (BPL). Like the LPG subsidy, an amount of Rs 100-150 or so can be deposited in their accounts on monthly basis till the rates are high. An average sized family does not consume more than 4-5 kgs of onions a month,"" suggested Wasani.Azad a retailer in Gokulpeth market said some grades were also auctioned at Rs 1600 a maund or Rs 40 a kg in wholesale market. ""The quality is not very good. Almost half the stock purchased from wholesalers had to be weeded out. This hikes the rates at retailers' end, even if wholesale prices remain stable,"" he said.Potatoes slideWhile onions are riding high, potato rates have touched an ebb. The wholesale market rates are in the range of Rs 8 to 9 a kg. Though retailers are selling it at Rs 14 to 16. This is the cheapest the spuds have been in last 3-4 years. It is because of a major glut in all the potato growing states. Traders say production is 25% more than the last year. In some centres like Kanpur or Agra, rates have even touched Rs 5 a kg.Onion price chart(In Rs/kg)Current week 50 to 60Last week 40 to 50The week before 35"

(Source: Express photo)Many potato growers gave away almost 50 tonnes (50,000 kg) of their tubers free of cost in the city on Friday. They were protesting against what they claim to be the failure of the Centre and state government to protect them against plumeting prices of potato.Growers distributed the potatoes at the Namdev chowk market and even stopped vehicles to give their produce away. When traffic began choking the chowk, they sent trollies loaded with potatoes to nearby mohallas. The news brought many people who came with empty bags to the protest, but left with very heavy ones.Due to over production of the crop last season, which was around 2.1 millions tonnes, only 5 to 10 per cent could be sold and remaining are lying in cold stores. There is no demand in anywhere in the country, said J S Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA). We want at least Rs 1 per kilogram freight subsidy from the state government so that the potato can be taken to those states where it could be sold.They also demanded lifting the export ban and that loans against potato farmers be waived. They warned the government that farmers may take to suicide if they do not get help in time.They also attacked middlemen for making huge profits at a time when the farmers of the state were struggling.We want subsidy not for profit but to clear our cold stores. We will harvest this years crops in November and we need to make space for it, said Raghbir Singh, president, JPGA.The association said that input cost for potato production was at the rate of Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kilo and that they were being forced to sell it at Rs 3 to Rs 4 per kilo.Last year, they could export potatoes to Pakistan but the Centre has banned it this year, they said. Potato farmers said that the move should be seen as only a trailer to a more bigger protest that would be organised if the government did not help them.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Scattered but adequate rainfall in the past two weeks has allowed farmers to reap this second crop.Yashwant Patil, secretary of APMC, Kalyan, said, ""Large shipments of the new stock have reached markets, easing prices. Two weeks ago, palak and methi were being sold for Rs 15 and Rs 20 a bunch, respectively.

Their prices have increased slightly,"" added Patil.Sudden showers across Thane, Mumbai, Nashik, Pune and other parts of the state few weeks ago has resulted in this hike.

Potatoes, which were available at Rs 5-8 a kg then, have marginally risen to Rs 8-10 a kg,"" Patil said.Deepak Jassuja, a wholesale vegetable vendor at Kopri, said prices may go up further as a second harvest for potatoes and onions was not possible.

Prices of other vegetables such as tomato, potato and brinjal have gone up nearly 60 per cent.An industry survey of 28 markets, including Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, has shown a wide difference between vegetables' wholesale and retail prices.The analysis suggests these markets have recorded 64.5 per cent decline in produce arrival in the April-June period of 2015-16, as compared to the same quarter the previous year.This clearly indicates a shortfall in vegetable production despite this being its peak season.The Assocham study has mapped 28 markets: Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Dehradun, Delhi, Gangtok, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jammu, Kolkata, Lasalgaon, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Nasik, Patna, Pimpalgaon, Pune, Raipur, Ranchi, Shimla, Srinagar and Thiruvananthapuram.Vegetables like tomato, brinjal, cauliflower, garlic, cabbage and okra have witnessed a runaway rise in prices in the first quarter of 2015-16, against the same period in the previous fiscal, noted the Assocham study.Tomato prices, for instance, have seen an increase of as much as 61 per cent in the hybrid variety and 55 per cent in the local variety in wholesale markets. Likewise, chilli has become hotter, with wholesale prices shooting up 39.5 per cent, while brinjal is 36.8 per cent dearer.Prices of garlic have gone up 28.5 per cent, onion 23.1 per cent, cabbage 19 per cent and okra 11 per cent.What is worrying is that on top of this sharp increase in vegetable prices, there is a huge gap between wholesale and retail rates, which clearly points to an urgent need for plugging supply-chain loopholes. The advantage of price rise is certainly not going to producers, said Assocham.A recent RBI survey of 5,000 households across 16 cities has also shown homemakers expect further price rise in essential items in the next 3-6 months.Households expect inflation to touch 10.1 per cent within three months, said the RBI's June survey. The one-year inflation expectation was 10.3 per cent. India last experienced double-digit inflation in November 2013."

CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury attended the protest. ""Suicides won't fetch us anything. Only a united struggle by peasants and our struggle in Parliament can make this deaf government hear our demands,"" Yechury said, his call coming against the backdrop of claims the Narendra Modi government had not done enough to ease farm distress.

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam,.But the drop in rates has had little impact as inflow of customers has been low, he said. Business is very dull. Sales have been slowly dwindling for the last two weeks. We are seeing that the purchasing power of people has also come down. There are no occasions too, he said.Nevertheless, regular supply of vegetables has led to dip in rates. The cost of tomatoes has dropped from Rs. 20 to Rs. 10 this week. In fact, avarakkai was priced at Rs. 40 last week but now, it is sold at Rs. 15 per kg. This is because the supply is fresh from V. Kota.

The insured amount was Rs. 58.06 crore. As many as 10,698 farmers, in return, got Rs. 1.67 crore in the form of claims. On an average, each farmer got around Rs. 1,500.The weather-based insurance scheme does not help the farmer, commented B.R. Satyanarayana, a farmer and member of Hassan Zilla Panchayat. Under this scheme, a hobli is treated as one unit. Even if a farmer has lost the crop entirely, his chances of getting the benefit are very less. If a vehicle owner insures his vehicle and meets with an accident or loses his vehicle, he wont commit suicide. The insurance company will take care of the vehicle. Why not the same standard be followed in the case of agricultural sector? he asked.The insurance company made a profit of nearly Rs. 5.3 crore by insuring potato in Hassan district. Farmers paid the premium because the government insisted on it. One of my friends took crop loan from a commercial bank. The bank was not prepared to sanction the loan till he agreed to insure his crop. The governments policies help the company earn profit at the cost of poor farmers, he alleged. However, this year, the State government has not notified insurance for potato in Hassan. Mr. Ramachandraiah said, the government had not announced the scheme for potato. We have not collected premium this year as there is no insurance cover, he added."
212,Spartan show by corrupt Howrah crorepati,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Spartan-show-by-corrupt-Howrah-crorepati/articleshow/48507290.cms,2015-08-17,The Times Of India,"HOWRAH: A month before Durga Puja last year local youths of Naskar para in Howrah's Ghusuri knocked on the door of house for subscription. The occupant of the house put his head out of the small window beside the main gate and told the group to come back three days later. Pranab Adhikary who allegedly amassed over 20 crores of rupees finally paid up the subscription of Rs 250 after much cajoling by the youths who had to make four trips to his house in over two weeks.One of Pranab's daily chore on Sundays and holidays was to visit the local market and buy half kilogram of fish for the family. ""He never bought more than half kilogram. Many times I would request him to buy more but he won't,"" said Netai Mondal from whom Pranab would often purchase fish in Naskar para market.Conversations with several neighbours, colleagues and real estate promoters in Howrah's Bally who associated with Pranab Adhikary have thrown up interesting anecdotes about the sub-assistant engineer that give an insight into the mind of the person who maintained a very low profile throughout his career and went about amassing several crores of rupees through ""cut-money"".Despite sitting on crores of rupees, literally, Pranab and his family led a very frugal and austere life due to which nobody could ever gauge that a lower ranking civic official like him had amassed so much of wealth in his residence.The officers of the anti-corruption bureau ceased over 20 crore rupees from Pranab's house in Ghusuri on Friday which were hidden in a commode, cistern and sofa cushions.He is in police custody along with his son Tanmoy who police said assisted him.Pranab who hails from a humble background joined the Bally Municipality in 1995.""His father worked in a jute mill. One of his brothers still sells potatoes in the local market. He moved out from his parents' home fifteen years ago. Since then he has hardly kept in touch with them,"" a relative of Pranab said.Former colleagues said at work Pranab would mostly keep to himself and would speak very less with his co-workers, two traits that soon caught the attention of his seniors and politicians in the municipality.""Such lower ranking officials normally do not attract much attention of the public and vigilance department,"" said a former colleague of Pranab who retired in 2011.Soon he became a crucial cog of the politician-officer-promoter nexus in Bally where in the late 1990s and early 2000s early signs of real estate boom had already started to show.Bally Municipality has now been merged with the Howrah Municipal Corporation.Bally Municipality is primarily divided into Liluah, Belur and Bally. Liluah that roughly comprises of eight wards was the first to witness the construction boom when several families from Burrabazar, Posta, Mahatma Gandhi Road and Malapara started migrating to Howrah.Liluah was primarily a commercial place with several foundaries, mills and factories many of which had shut down several years ago. Promoters started targeting these large swathes of land but there was a problem.""According to civic rules, the nature of the land had to be regularized from commercial or wetland to land for domestic purpose. This was a difficult task and this is where Pranab came into the picture,"" said a promoter who has executed atleast eight projects in Liluah in the past 10 years.Pranab became the point's man whom the promoters would approach to get the building plans sanctioned. Once the sub-assitant engineer would put his seal on the plans, they got cleared at the upper level.But Pranab's service would come at a price of one lakh rupees per cottah.""Any promoter who wanted his plan to be sanctioned would have to pay Pranab's his price. But every promoter knew that if Pranab sanctioned the plan, nobody in the municipality would oppose it,"" said another promoter in Belur.Towards the end of 2000s, Pranab became so powerful that even very senior officials and political leaders in the municipality would not over rule his decision.A promoter from whom Pranab demanded Rs 16 lakhs for a 9 cottah plot in 2009 decided to circumvent him and approach other senior officials for the permissions.His project is yet to take-off.Pranab had one rule, though. He would not take any money in the office. Promoters met him at his residence in Durga Pal er Math in Naskar para.Bapi Saha, who has a small convenience store a few meters from Pranab's house, would often get irritated when strangers on bikes would stop infront of his shop and enquire about Pranab's residence.""This would start at 7pm and continue till 10pm. We thought since he works in the municipality, these people come to him with requests,"" said Saha, 54.Pranab's neighbor however hardly saw any evidence ever suggesting that Pranab was ""savouring"" the huge wealth he was amassing.""We hardly saw them in new clothes during festivals. They had an old two-wheeler which both the father and the son used. They would hardly do any charity in the locality,"" said Tapan das, a neighbor of Pranab.At Bapi Saha's store too, the family would buy cereals, rice and oil in very less quantity.According to psychologists, the strange behavior of Pranab of leading such an austere life despite having so much cash could be due to paranoia.""This is a disorder where a person is just happy in hoarding money. He has problems mustering the courage to spend it out of the fear that the money may get over. Such people check on the horded money at frequent intervals and derive reassurance out of it,"" said Aveek Mukherjee, a city based psychologist.The only thing he may have spent some money on is her children's education. His son Tanmoy completed his engineering from a private college in Liluah. His daughter completed her higher secondary recently from a decent school in Bally."

The price of potato fell 28 per cent; beetroot 15 per cent; carrot 20 per cent; brinjal 16 per cent; bhindi 26 per cent; pumpkin 21 per cent and vegetable cowpea 21 per cent.Nendran banana from outside Kerala sold for Rs. 40 a kg in the retail market while Kerala-produced banana was dearer and sold for Rs. 44 a kg, said figures from the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam.The price of vegetable cow pea from outside Kerala was Rs. 20 a kg in the retail market while the Kerala-produced vegetable sold for around Rs. 60 a kg.Bhindi price too varied depending on the source. Bhindi produced in Kerala cost Rs. 40 a kg while the price of bhindi from outside the State was Rs. 16 a kg. Bitter gourd price varied between Rs. 40 and 34 a kg. The price of bottle gourd from outside was Rs. 12 a kg, while the Kerala variety cost Rs. 20 a kg in the retail market."

The upward trend will remain for some weeks,"" Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) member Rajendra Sharma told PTI.The onion rate at the mandis in Delhi is ruling firm because wholesale traders are getting the commodity at very high prices from key growing states like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, he explained.Depending on quality, the price varies between Rs 70 and Rs 80.There is onion stock in these states, but rates quoted are very high, he added.For instance, the wholesale price of onion at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra -- the Asia's biggest market for onions -- rose to Rs 43 per kg, the highest so far this year, due to sluggish supply of the crop.Eventually, the ripple effect of rising wholesale prices gets reflected in the retail market, which is mostly unorganised, Sharma said.Muntu, who sells only onions and potatoes near Kali Bari Temple, said, ""I was selling onions at Rs 50-60 per kg till last week, but today I am selling at Rs 70-80 per kg because wholesale prices have risen sharply in the last two days.""He added,"" I had bought onions at Rs 60-65 per kg from Azadpur and am retailing with a margin of Rs 10 per kg.""A similar increase in prices is being witnessed in other parts of the Delhi and the national capital region (NCR).Meanwhile, a central Small Farmers' Agriculture-Business Consortium (SFAC) -- which has purchased 7,000-8,000 tonnes under the price stabilisation fund -- has been selling onions through Mother Dairy's Safal outlets as well as 100 booths of Delhi Milk Scheme (DMS).The cooperative Nafed has also supplied 2,500 tonnes to the Delhi government, which is selling at a subsidised rate of Rs 30 per kg in 280 locations in the capital.Meanwhile, Nafed has re-invited tenders for import of 10,000 tonnes of onions, which are expected to arrive in the next month.Onion prices are hardening due to the fall in production and sluggish supply of stored onions, which are meant for meeting demand during the lean July-September.Total onion production is estimated to be lower at 189 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July-June), slightly lower than 194 lakh tonnes a year ago.Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh are the top three onion-producing states in the country."

Mr. Maurya said it is a matter of concern that the Fourth Estate is being targeted.Demanding the arrest of the ring leader, the Leader of Opposition said the security of journalists should be ensured by the State Government. He alleged that the attacks on media personnel were not taken seriously by the Government.Congress Legislature Party leader Pradeep Mathur also condemned the attempts to muzzle the media. The BSP and the Congress then staged a walkout.With Backward Classes Welfare Minister Ambika Chaudhary accusing the Leader of Opposition of being interested in publicity, BJP leader Suresh Kumar Khanna referred to the attack on a newspaper office in Kairana (Shamli) by goons belonging to a leader enjoying the status of a Minister of State. Mr. Khanna said he had sympathies for the journalists.In what was a day of walkouts, the BSP staged a second walkout, this time over the issue of remunerative prices for potato growers. On the issue of the steps taken by the Government to increase the agricultural growth rate, it was the turn of BJP to stage a walkout expressing dissatisfaction at the Governments reply.Another BJP walkout was on the subject of the flight of industries from Uttar Pradesh. Replying to a query from Satish Mahana and Jyotsna Srivastava of the BJP and Lokendra Singh of BSP, Minister of State for Industrial and Infrastructure Development Ram Murti Verma said from April 2012 to May 2015, 135089 micro, small, medium and large industries were set up in the State. The Minister said an investment of Rs.20,666.62 crore had been made and jobs have been created for 12.62 lakh persons.However, on the flight of industries, the Minister said information on the same is not available. While Mr. Mahana said the Government was trying to mislead, Mr. Lokendra Singh mentioned the flight of leather industry from Agra to Madras (Chennai). While Vimla Batham of the BJP said many industries had shifted base to Uttarakhand, Mr. Khanna said the Government had failed to prevent the flight of industries. Not convinced with the Governments reply, the BJP staged a walkout."

Moreover, not many marriages are held during Aadi, causing a drop in prices of vegetables. With the beginning of marriage season, the prices of vegetables and flowers have again picked up.Madurai flower market president A V Manoharan Malligai said the price of jasmine, which had sold at Rs 180 per kg the previous week, had gone up to Rs 350 per kg on Friday.""Jasmines decide the price of other flowers in the Madurai market. Last month, there was better inflow of flowers but that has now gone down, which is one reason why the prices are going up,"" he said. About five tonnes of jasmines were brought to the Madurai market on Friday.Manoharan added that prices in the Madurai market was more reasonable compared to other markets. Vendors from Coimbatore also come to the district to source flowers for Onam. Roses, which are usually sold at Rs 20 per kg, fetched up to Rs 100 on Friday. Pitchi flowers sold at Rs 300 per kg, while the price of chrysanthemums hovered at around Rs 200 per kg.The supply of jasmines will go down when the chilly season begins and pitchi and coloured flowers like December flowers will start flooding the market soon, he added.Meanwhile, the price of vegetables has also started to go up due to the advent of the marriage season. A kg of onion, which sold at Rs 45, went up to Rs 60 in the Oddanchathiram market, due to decreased supply to the market. The price of vegetables went up in the retail market as well. A kg of tomatoes were being sold at Rs 15 in Anna Nagar, against the market price of Rs 7. Potatoes have also become expensive in the retail market, hovering at Rs 40 per kg against the market price of Rs 30. Butterbeans and green peas, which find a place in wedding feasts, have also gone up to Rs 50 and Rs 70 per kg, about Rs 10 more than last month, due to heavy demand and lesser inflow to the markets, said R Venkatesh, a vendor.In Thovalai market, a kg of jasmine sold at Rs 350 on Friday and for Rs 500 the day before."
217,Growers left chewing on outcome of seesawing prices of arecanut,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/growers-left-chewing-on-outcome-of-seesawing-prices-of-arecanut/article7570629.ece,2015-08-23,The Hindu,"Forget the highs and lows in the prices of the potato and onion. The price of our local arecanut has been highly volatile of late, seesawing from Rs. 900 a kg in August 2014 to Rs. 280 a kg today. In the last one year, its price has slumped by around 70 per cent. The increase in import of the produce is being blamed for the sudden slump in price.Given that in April 2014, the price was just Rs. 210 a kg and jumped to Rs. 900 a kg by August that year, the lucrative price enticed many farmers cultivating food crops to switch to arecanut. The result: the area of cultivation that was 90,000 acres in Shivamogga district prior to the increase in price crossed the one lakh acres mark.Owing to heavy rain that lashed Malnad and coastal Karnataka in 2013, there was a 50 per cent decline in yield due to fruit rot disease ( koleroga ).This created a mismatch between demand and supply resulting in escalation of prices.The Union government, in May 2013, decided to raise the base import price of arecanut from Rs. 75 a kg to Rs. 110 a kg. This caused a demand for the locally-grown variety and a positive mood in the market.After the price of the local arecanut began to move northwards, the firms engaged in manufacturing value-added products from arecanut opted to import the produce at cheaper prices.This triggered a slump in the local produce. Even an initiative by the Centre in the first week of June this year to enhance the base import price from Rs. 110 a kg to Rs. 162 a kg to arrest the price slump had little impact. B.A. Ramesh Hegde, president of Shivamogga Adike Belegarara Sangha, an association of arecanut growers, told The Hindu that the total import of arecanut was 18,228 quintal in 2013-14. It jumped to 1,00,846 quintal in 2014-15.At present, as low import duty is charged under the South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA), and imports from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries enjoy total exemption, arecanut is being imported from these countries under international trade agreements. Mr. Hegde said the Centre should de-list arecanut from the SAFTA and SAARC trade agreements, and also think of imposing a total ban on import of arecanut."

Onion prices have shot up at the Koyambedu market since the end of the Tamil month of Aadi (mid-July to mid-August), while the price of tomato has almost doubled. As Onam festival nears and the wedding season begins, vegetables will be dearer to the daily buyer.A trader at Koyambedu, Soundarrajan said, ""Price of onions brought from Maharashtra has gone up by about Rs 15 per kilogram and is likely to drop only after a month when the second lot of the crop comes to the market."" Price of onions that are procured from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka has gone up by Rs 10.""Vegetable prices undergo a steep rise on 'muhurtham' days when marriages are held in the city,"" said Vinayaga Catering Services owner Anand. A combination of factors has led to the rise in price of many other vegetables that are not grown in Tamil Nadu.Soundarrajan said, ""The only consolation is that the locally cultivated sambar onion prices have remained stable as the supply is steady."" The Koyambedu market gets its sambar onions from Theni and Perumbalur districts. A kilogram of sambar onions sells at Rs 40 per kilogram in the wholesale market, while the retail price is Rs 50.Price of both the local and Bangalore tomatoes has nearly doubled since the end of Aadi. Bangalore tomatoes which sold at Rs 7 a week ago are now being sold at Rs 15, while the country tomato is priced at Rs 10.""We have no choice but to pass on the price rise to the consumers,"" Anand added. Sourcing vegetables from the Koyambedu market is cheaper than buying at local retail stores and supermarkets. However, if one runs a catering business, the purchase is not profitable, said Anand. ""When you buy vegetables in bulk, a few kilograms rot away,"" Anand said, adding that it is impossible to predict price rise during the current season which makes it difficult for the caterer to draw up price estimates to the clients.""The city gets most of its onions from Nasik in Maharashtra. The supply has come down since last month,"" said Koyambedu Tomato Traders Association president Thyagarajan. The market which used to get 1,500 tonnes of onions a day weeks ago is now getting only 1,000 tonnes.Potato prices, however, have remained stable as there has been an excessive yield in the northern states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat from where it is brought to the city. Potatoes that are sold at Rs 15 per kilogram can be sourced from Koyambedu for Rs 12 per kilogram.The next muhurtham date falls on August 27 when the prices are expected to skyrocket again. ""Prices will drop after the muhurtham day and rise again on the next muhurtham. But it is difficult to predict the price rise due to shortage in supply from other states,"" a trader at Koyambedu said."

Even if farmers go in for a crop for diversification, they soon come back to the old wheat-paddy pattern.One of the reasons is the confidence of the farmers that these crops would sure be lifted by government agencies at the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government. The MSP of many other crops is also fixed by the government, but they are not purchased by the government agencies and farmers have to depend on private traders, and most of them do not get even the MSP for these crops.The government fixes the MSP of about 27 crops, but only paddy and wheat are lifted by the government agencies while the others are mostly bought by the private traders. The fluctuation in prices and uncertainty of procurement keeps farmers away from other crops Even MSP of some crops is not encouraging.The MSP of long staple cotton was fixed at Rs 4,100 per quintal, but it was much lower than the expectation of the farmers.""If all input costs of cotton are taken into account, the price of cotton should be at least Rs 6,000 per quintal to attract farmers to grow it. The price of cotton remained around Rs 4,500 per quintal last year, which is very discouraging,"" said Sukha, a farmer from Faridkot village.""There were about four cotton-ginning mills in the town when cotton was grown as a major crop, but they stopped functioning years ago and now there is none. There is no flour mill and factory to process pulses in the town also. There are only rice mills now and if the farmers try some other crop, they face the problem of marketing also,"" said Mohinder Kumar Bansal, a commission agent from Faridkot.""In the '90s, there were about two dozen cotton-ginning factories in Kotkapura town alone as it was one of the largest markets of cotton, but last year only one was in a working condition, while most of others were converted into rice mills,"" said Ashok Kumar Goyal, general secretary of the commission agents association from Kotkpaura.The area under cotton had substantially come down due to repeated attacks of bollworm in the nineties, that led to many crop failures, lower prices and rising cost of labour.This year, cotton is expected to cover 13,800 hectares while paddy and basmati are expected to cover an area of 1 lakh hectares in Faridkot. Only moong is expected to be on around 1,000 hectares.During the rabi season, wheat was grown on 1,16,000 hectares in the district while barley and oilseed crops covered only 500 and 700 hectares respectively. A small area was under beat root and potatoes.""The farmers are ready to grow any crop if they are confident that it will be lifted at profitable rates and fetches income more than wheat and paddy. Even potato growers had to suffer huge losses this season,"" said Jaswinder Singh, a farmer from Ghania village.""The farmers are inclined to grow other crops like maize and pulses. But, they are not sure that they would be lifted in time and at reasonable rates. Hence, paddy and wheat remain major crops as farmers are confident that they would be procured by the government at the fixed rate,' said Kulbeer Singh Matta, district mandi officer, Faridkot."

Nearly 12 quintals of onion was sold from the stalls and each buyer was allowed to buy only 1-2-kg of onions, he informed.""We are concerned about the rising prices of onions and that is why we have made available onion at reasonable rates at these outlets,"" he said. The ABUVM would sell the vegetable at 'no profit no loss' basis for the next few days from similar outlets across the city, he added.Mishra said that the supply of onions and potatoes had been affected in several onion producing states due to heavy rains causing price rise. He said that the ABUVM leaders in a letter sent to the Central government demanded availability of onions to the people at reasonable rates. ""We have also urged the government to come down heavily on hoarders and blackmarketeers in the onion producing states"", he informed.""It is strange seeing people queuing up for onions at the onion stalls. But there is nothing new in it. Earlier also, we had faced the same problem, but then also the government did not take any concrete action to find out any solution to it. The prices of onions touching the sky itself speak volumes on the apathy of the government. The amount which we used to spent on buying the whole grocery is now being spent on buying onions only,"" rued Rushali, a housewife.Vaibhavi, another housewife complained, ""I really feel pity for this country where I saw people making queues for onion at stalls. The government should do something in this regard without any further delay. Due high onion prices I am preferring cooking meals sans onion. But the reality is that nobody enjoys food without onion. It is really hard to spend Rs 70-80 on just onions.""Vimal, a vegetable vendor said, ""Knowing about the situation we had already stocked onion crop in bulk. But it seems to be tough to maintain the stock as half of the stock has already been sold but the prices do not seem to come down.

They added potato price at Agra is around Rs 5.50 per kg and in Jalandhar the commodity is selling at Rs 6.25. These are the two major potato growing states. Even in Jaipur, prices are around Rs 4.20 per kg.Agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain said that the solution to both exceptional price rise and unsustainable crash in prices lies in creating a national agriculture market where all farm produce can cross states without any barriers."

The situation has worsened in Delhi because of the Aam Aadmi Party-led governments inadequate action against hoarders. This apart, central agency SFAC and NAFED are supplying onions at subsidised rates in Delhi markets below Rs. 40 a kg, said Mr. Paswan.The AAP, however, refuted all allegations and said that it is now in talks with big traders. There are several big traders of onions who import the kitchen staple from other countries. The government has decided to approach them and request them to buy onions in large quantity so that their prices could be brought down in the market, said Mr. Rai.At the review meeting, the traders informed the Ministers that the prices of onion have gone down by Rs. 3 to Rs. 5 in the markets of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, and that the impact would reflect in the next three-four days in the citys markets.Reacting to The Hindus report on August 24 on the non-availability of the edible bulb at several fair price shops, Mr. Khan said that the Capital has seen a spike in the demand of onions over the past week.Our supply of onions is not affected at all. Trucks are arriving on a daily basis. The government is regularly sending supplies of onions to local markets at lesser prices.

224,636 quintals of hoarded onions seized in Chhattisgarh,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/636-quintals-of-hoarded-onions-seized-in-chhattisgarh/,2015-08-25,Indian Express,"Amid the soaring onion prices, as many as 636 quintals of the Agri-commodity worth around Rs 30 lakhs was seized during raids by sleuths of food and revenue departments at two godowns in the city.The onions were hoarded in the godowns of M/s Nagraj and M/s Tikamdas located in Bhanpuri area on the outskirts of Raipur, a food department official said.Following a tip-off, the officials last evening raided the site and seized 636 quintals of onion, 350 quintals from the godown of M/s Nagraj and 286 quintals from M/s Tikamdas, he said.The onions were stored without obtaining permission and other valid documents from the department, he said.The action was taken following the directives by Chief Minister Raman Singh to conduct special drives to check hoarding of the pricey kitchen staple and other food commodities, in an apparent bid to check the rising prices of essential food items, he said.During inspection, the traders were informed that onion and potato have been included within the purview of stock-holding limits under the Essential Commodities Act-1955, therefore, it is mandatory to publish stock and prices of onion on their billboards.The CM has directed all the district collectors to carry out similar surprise inspections in their respective region and keep a close watch on the situation.The food and revenue departments officials also raided godowns in Bilaspur and Durg district headquarters, but no hoarded stock of onions was found there.However, necessary instructions were given to merchants there too, the official added.Meanwhile, the wholesale prices of onion today fell below the Rs 50 per kg mark at the Lasalgaon in Maharashtra, Asias biggest onion market, due to curbs on exports and fear of action against hoarding.Even at Azadpur mandi in Delhi, wholesale onion price declined by Rs 3-5 per kg to Rs 53 today on increase in arrival of new crop from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.However, retail onion prices across the country continue to rule as high as Rs 80 per kg.At Lasalgaon, which sets the price trend across the country, the wholesale onion price declined to Rs 48.5 per kg today from Rs 57 per kg last week, according to the data maintained by Nashik-based National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

However, this time it has fallen to Rs 600. At Kanthallur, it has been certified by the Kerala Agriculture University that no harmful pesticides were found in the vegetables. The main items are potato, carrot, beetroot, beans and garlic.The Agriculture Department under the Integrated Tribal Development Scheme had selected two tribal villages of Mangaparakudy and Vallavayalkudy for vegetable cultivation. Eighty-five hectares of land were brought under vegetable cultivation with nearly 50 hectares being potato. The harvesting of the potato started on Monday in these settlements. As it was aimed at initiating the tribal people into vegetable cultivation, the fall in the prices could make them retract from vegetable farming, the official said adding that in the coming days there are chances of further decline in the prices when the major portion starts arriving in the market. In Vattavada alone, of the 2,927 hectares total vegetable cultivation around 990 hectares is for potato.This time the production is average and newly cultivated areas could make a better harvest, said P.T. Mohandas, president Kanthallur Cool Season Vegetable Marketing Farmers Society.

227,Raids to check onion hoarding,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150827/jsp/jharkhand/story_39242.jsp,2015-08-27,Telegraph,"Onions hovering at Rs 70 a kilo or crossing it at retail markets in Ranchi have prompted the district administration on Wednesday to swing into action and prevent black-marketing and hoarding of this essential commodity. Ranchi subdivisional officer Amit Kumar on Wednesday raided the premises of wholesale dealers of onions across Pandra market yard in the outskirts of the city. But, no cases of hoarding beyond permissible limits have been found till this report was filed at 5pm. ""According to state government norms, no trader can hoard onion more than 500 quintals. Our raids in around dozens of business premises showed maximum stocks of 250 to 300 quintals. So, we can say there is no hoarding of the commodity, so far"" Kumar told The Telegraph. Along with onions, the SDO's team is also on the look out for hoarding of pulses whose prices have also skyrocketed, with arhar crossing the Rs 140-per-kilo mark and no variety available below Rs 100. Like in the case of onions, the state government has said it is illegal to hoard pulses beyond 500 quintal. ""So far they had found one trader stocking 4,000 quintals of pulses at one Durga Mill,"" the SDO said. ""We will take action against the erring trader after the raids are over,"" he added. Local markets on Wednesday kept the price of onion between Rs 60 and Rs 70 per kilo. Reliance Fresh outlets sold onions for Rs 72 a kilo. A wholesale trader told The Telegraph that onions were sold at Rs 5,500 per quintal. ""As the crop from Nashik in Maharashtra was too insufficient this year, Jharkhand is getting supply of onions from Andhra Pradesh whose quality is also not good,"" said S.L. Gupta, a leading wholesale trader in Ranchi. ""In retail markets, the per-kilogram price is Rs 15 more than wholesale, which is largely due to the fact that among the consignment that we get, a lot of rotten onions are found."" He claimed there was no black-marketing or hoarding in the city. ""We are getting consignments late from Andhra Pradesh markets."" ""After reports of Nashik onions getting destroyed earlier this year, the Union government should have prevented exports. Then, the domestic market would not have suffered,"" Gupta added. ""We are waiting for fresh stocks of onion from Nashik in the next 15 days. Prices will fall after that,"" Gupta hoped. Right now, potato, selling for Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kilogram at retail markets in the capital, seems to be the mainstay for kitchens where onions and pulses are too hot to handle. The wholesale price of potatoes is around Rs 300 per 50kg sack."

Deserving farmers who suffered huge losses due to drought and flood have not been compensated while those who have not suffered have benefited.""He asked the deputy commissioners to conduct another survey and ensure that deserving farmers are compensated adequately. District officials including DCs, additional commissioner and assistant commissioners have been asked to conduct surprise checks. Of the 176 taluks in 30 districts, 27 districts (126 taluks) across the state are declared drought affected. The severity of drought is high in 12 districts of North Karnataka.The DCs briefed about the prevailing situation in their districts. The ministers called upon the DCs to create awareness among farmers on alternate crops, like for farmers in Mandya, the ministers asked the DCs to promote ragi cultivation instead of just focusing on sugarcane. Byre Gowda promised to provide better price for ragi.District minister Srinivas Prasad said that there will be no discrimination in compensation. It will vary and depend upon the prevailing conditions, he added.Prasad, law minister TB Jayachandra, fisheries and sports minister Abhay Chandra Jain, urban development minister Vinay Kumar Sorke, PWD minister Mahadevappa and officials from eight districts attended the review meet.More taluks may be declared drought-affected, feared Jayachandra. ""As of now, 126 taluks have been declared drought-affected. On Thursday, at the cabinet sub-committee meeting headed by the CM to be held in Bengaluru, more taluks may declared drought hit. In July, the state recorded overall deficit rainfall of 49%. All the districts in the state except Udupi recorded deficit to scanty rainfall.The state government has etimated losses of Rs 12,000 and has requested the Centre for Rs 3,050.72 crore assistance, added Jayachandra.The CM has convened a meeting of deputy commissioners on September 1.When Holenarasipura MLA HD Revanna said no action was taken against an official who misappropriated a farmer's money, Jayachandra asked Hassan ZP CEO Venkatesh to suspend the official immediately. Mahesh, first division assistant in the horticulture department, Holenarasipur taluk, misappropriated Rs 1.24 lakh which was to be given to 116 potato farmers. The official withdrew the money but didn't pay the farmers. Each farmer was to get Rs 1,500- 2,000. The forgery came to light in April and a probe is under way."

However some experts have raised doubts about the quality of onions on offer.Rapidly mushrooming, online grocery firms say they are able to maintain a lower price point for onions by cutting down on profit margins, eliminating middlemen, and managing logistics better.Co-founder of Localbanya Amit Naik, said that low pricing is a result of planned procurement and good marketing strategy. He remarked that the website has seen an increase in demand recently.Seshu Kumar, head of national merchandising at BigBasket, said that the company sources its onions and other greens directly from farmers. ""As of now, we are working on cost-to-cost basis and although we do not stock onions, we are able to predict the demands of our customers,"" he said. Kumar also stated that the website does not allow any customer to purchase over 2 kg onion at a time to avoid bulk buys.""We have priced onions in such a manner that we do not make any losses or profits. At the same time, we assure quality to our customers and stock only as much as required,"" explains Mukesh Singh, founder of ZopNow, a self-funded online grocery delivery firm that has recently crossed 3,500 orders in Pune.Zip.in, another innovative online grocery firm, has introduced combo plans for frequently bought items to reduce the overall pricing. ""Since prices of tomatoes have also increased to Rs 80/kg in various parts of the country, we are offering a kilo each of the three staples - onion, potato and tomato at Rs 104, if bought together,"" says Kishore Ganji, chief executive officer of Zip.in.An online retailer remarked that onions, which are being sold at very low or near-wholesale prices, are not of the best quality and consumers will end up wasting or discarding most of their purchase. Another retailer pointed out that those selling onions at a low price would face losses eventually."
234,Falling demand,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/498209/falling-demand.html,2015-08-30,Deccan Herald,"Bharat Jhunjhunwala Aug 31, 2015, DHNS: 0:00 ISTChina has devalued its currency, the yuan. This has sent jitters in the financial markets across the globe. Stocks are down and currencies of most emerging markets are following the downward trajectory of the yuan.The United States has long been saying that the yuan was already much below its real value. The US had been asking China to revalue the yuan upwards. Instead, China has devalued its currency so as to maintain the pace of its exports. Chinas exports have been declining at a monthly rate of about (-)5 per cent for the last few months.The Indian rupee has declined in tandem. A cheaper yuan means that Chinese goods will be cheaper for the US consumer. An American consumer was getting 64 yuan worth of Chinese goods for 10 dollars till a week ago. Now she will get 66 yuan worth of goods for the same ten dollars. As a result, Chinese goods will become more attractive.Correspondingly, Indian goods will become less attractive. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India has allowed the rupee to slide in tandem with the decline of the yuan. In effect, therefore, China has gained very little. It is like the weekly street market at 10 pm. Every seller reduces his price so that he can get rid of the stocks but none succeeds because the customers are few.At the root of the problem is falling global demand. The developed countries were previously making exclusive goods. In the 1950s, for example, the General Motors of the US and Morris of the United Kingdom were selling cars in India. They were among the few global producers of cars. They could sell the cars at a high price because the Indian consumer did not have much choice.These manufacturers paid high wages to their workers from these large earnings. In recent times, the US companies like Microsoft have likewise sold Windows software to consumers across the world at high prices and used these earnings to pay high salaries to their employees.The situation has flipped lately. The Indian companies are making cars and exporting to the US today. The number of pioneering products that the developed countries are able to sell in the global market is fast declining. In consequence, wages are stagnant or declining. Their workers no longer have the purchasing power to buy TVs from China and clothes from India.This decline in wages of workers of the developed countries is coming along with increase in wages of workers of the developing countries. However, the decline in wages of the developed countries is steep while the increase in wages of the developing countries is minimal.Think of a water tanker discharging its water into a pond. Decline in the level of the tanker will be huge while increase in the level of the pond will be minimal. The number of workers in the developing countries runs into billions. Therefore, the increase in wages due to the shift of manufacturing from Detroit to Chennai is virtually nil. Globalisation is a one-way street with lowering wages for the workers of developed countries.This decline in demand from the developed countries is counteracted by new inventions. Last two decades have seen an exponential expansion in demand for mobile phones, computers, TVs, photocopy machines, and metro rail. We have thus, before us, two opposing tendencies. The demand for goods in the global market is declining because workers of the developed countries are facing a wage crunch. On the other hand, demand for new products is being generated.It will be obvious that the decline in demand by the developed countries will necessarily continue. Global movement of goods will necessarily lead to a shift of manufacturing to the low wage countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam. Accordingly, the number of jobs in the developed countries will decline. The increase in demand due to the invention of new products, however, will always remain uncertain.Game-changing productOne did not know in the 1980s that the personal computer will be invented. One did not know in the 90s that mobile telephony will become so cheap. Invention of a similar game-changing product has not been made in the first decade of this century, however.The natural trajectory for the global economy, therefore, is to slip into a long recession. This tendency has been counteracted in the last century by a spate of new inventions beginning with the manufacture of Ford T on the assembly line.Whether the natural tendency will be nullified by new inventions is hard to predict. Experience of the last two decades is not encouraging. Therefore, I think a global recession is more likely in the coming period.The government must change gears. Its efforts aimed at attracting multinational corporations to Make in India for the global market are certain to fail. One does not put up a new cold storage when the potato stored in the existing facility is rotting. Therefore, the government must push for import substitution. Let us make goods that we are importing at present. That is feasible.My prognosis is subject to one caveat. Development of a new invention, say, a personal helicopter that will replace the car, will jumpstart the global economy into a new phase of growth. Recession is certain if such an invention does not take place.(The writer was former Professor of Economics, Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore)"

More than 300 farmers in Samiyaralakkudy and Koodallarkkudi villages in Vattavada panchayat were involved in the project, said K. Prathapan, director of the Horticulture Mission.He said that a group of farmers from Vattavada were sent to Jalandhar to gain firsthand experience on potato cultivation practices, particularly on the use of the high-yielding variety.It was double delight for the farmers, who saw higher yields and received up to Rs.14 a kg for the produce ahead of Onam. Most of the harvest was procured by Horticorp.There are a total of 3,000 hectares under potato cultivation in the State, mostly spread out in the Kanthalloor, Vattavada, and Marayoor areas, said the Mission official.Availability of quality seeds was the most important problem facing potato cultivation, said the official, who pointed out that technological intervention was needed to ensure that the Kufri Jyoti success was replicated in other potato-growing areas of the State.Meanwhile, the Horticulture Mission is taking steps to meet shortage of water in the Vattavada and Kanthalloor areas through construction of check-dams. Seven check-dams and seven canals are being constructed in these areas at a total cost of Rs.23.45 crore. The projects in Kanthalloor panchayat are being financially backed by the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.Productivity goes up by more than double1,000 acres brought under Kufri Jyoti variety"

Onion prices had shot up on poor crop yields in Maharashtra and due to a spurt in demand because of recent festivals and the start of the marriage season, traders expect the prices to fall by some extent after the next yield arrives a month from now.But vegetable prices, which hit the sky toward the end of the Tamil month of 'Aadi' (mid-July to mid-August) two weeks ago, have not shown any sign of dropping just yet.Koyambedu Market Wholesalers' Association advisor R Soundararajan said the price of onions usually stabilises in the last week of the month. ""Consumption levels tend to go reduce, stabilising prices at the end of the month,"" he said. ""It hasn't happened as yet but we expect it to once supplies increase.""""Onions usually sell for 25 all year round. But prices have now gone up to nearly 70 at the Koyambedu market,"" said A Balaji, proprietor of Indira Stores in Thiruvanmiyur. ""Customers are buying smaller quantities of onions but there's been no change in the purchase of other vegetables whose prices have fallen. We've been selling more beetroot, brinjal, ladies finger and potato than in the previous two weeks.""Retail prices of vegetable sometimes stay high even when supply is normal because there are many middlemen involved in the vegetable trade, Soundararajan said.""The prices go up more than they should by the time they reach neighbourhood stores.

It said the revenue department was levying 13% tax on the 'Vegit' brand packed snacks it produced  aloo hara bhara kebab, aloo veg cutlet, aloo yummy cheese balls, aloo mazedar bonda and aloo jatpat tikki.A bench of Chief Justice H L Dattu and Justice Amitava Roy refused to entertain the petition saying, ""Aloo bonda can never be categorized as processed vegetable merely because of high content of potato. Processed vegetables are generally canned or frozen.""Merino's counsel argued that all these ready-made snacks had over 50% potato content and should get the benefit of lower VAT as applicable to processed food. The SC bench agreed with the reasoning given by the Karnataka HC and rejected the petition.The commissioner, commercial tax, in a July 24, 2010, order had said the snacks manufactured by Merino were unscheduled goods liable to tax at the rate of 13.5%. Merino challenged it in the HC. A single-judge bench favoured the snacks firm and ordered that its products would attract VAT at the rate of 4% like pickles and processed food items.However, a division bench allowed the revenue department's appeal and said while interpreting provisions relating to classification of commodities, the predominant test to be applied was based on the understanding of the commodity in its popular and commercial sense.""Applying the said test, it could be construed that the commodities in question are understood in common parlance or trade parlance as snack mix  a different commercial commodity from that of dehydrated potato flakes.

Nothing could be added to enlarge the meaning of the entry,"" the HC had said and drew a contrast between processed food and snacks.It said the general perception of processed vegetables or fruits was that these could be accepted as an alternative to fresh vegetables available in the market."
238,School lunches get a healthier facelift,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/498958/school-lunches-get-healthier-facelift.html,2015-09-03,Deccan Herald,"School lunches get a healthier faceliftSabrina Tavernise, September 4, 2015, INYT 0:03 ISTThe humble school lunch, that staple of most every American childs diet, has become healthier. That was the conclusion of a federal report released recently that showed that the nutritional profile of school meals in the United States had improved substantially since higher government standards went into effect in 2012.Nearly 80 per cent of schools offered two or more vegetables per meal in 2014, the data showed, up from 62 per cent in 2000. Two or more fruits were offered in about 78 per cent of schools, up from 68 per cent in 2000. About a third of schools now have salad bars.The big questions, of course, are whether students are eating these offerings, and, if so, whether that will help ease the obesity epidemic among the nations children. Since the 1970s, the prevalence of childhood obesity in the United States has more than tripled, raising the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular problems.But in recent years, health experts have documented small yet promising declines in the rate of childhood obesity, which was about 17 per cent in 2012, the most recent year the government has measured. Obesity has decreased among the youngest children, as well as among children of low-income families participating in federal food programs.Experts are hoping that better offerings in school lunches will move the needle for other children too, though the report measured only offerings of food, not what children were actually eating. The federal health authorities say they plan to release obesity figures for 2014 later this year.Students consume up to half their daily calories at school, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which released the data. Interviewers visited a nationally representative sample of schools in 2000, 2006 and 2014.Mostly gone are the days of white bread and canned corn. Canned vegetables are still served, but in far fewer schools. More than half of schools that prepared meals on site used fresh or frozen vegetables instead. For those that still served canned vegetables, 52 per cent used low-sodium varieties, up from 10 per cent in 2000.School food experts said the findings fit with what they had seen in districts across the country. Literally, the way the school lunch line looks is different, said Deb Bentzel, senior associate at the Food Trust in Philadelphia, a nonprofit that works to increase access to nutritious food in schools and communities. Its brighter, its healthier-looking, its fresher.Traditional offerings have become healthier. For example, hot dogs have less fat and are made partly from turkey. A lunch tray is more likely to include legumes  Beans and chickpeas, that sort of thing, Bentzel said.Snacking healthyEven snacks, long problematic as calorie-boosters, have gotten better. For example, in the Philadelphia school district, potato chips are baked, not fried; beverages no longer include sweetened teas or sodas; and serving sizes are smaller  changes the district began implementing in 2004, years before the stricter school food rules took effect, said Amy Virus, the acting food service director for the district.The rules, detailed in 2012 by the Department of Agriculture based on a law that waspassed in 2010, have prompted broad changes in school menus across the US. Although the law passed with bipartisan support, its implementation has been politically messier, and some of its core elements  reducing sodium in school food  have become targets of some Republican lawmakers.Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that with the laws renewal up for review this fall, consumer groups were watching to guard against rollbacks of any major provisions. The improvement to school foods in the last three years is much more than had been done in the last three decades, she said.One criticism of the new meals has been that students were throwing away the healthier food, but Wootan said that problem is eternal in school cafeterias and had even improved slightly since the new rules took effect.A study in 12 urban schools released this year by the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut found the proportion of students choosing a vegetable dropped to 52 per cent in 2014 from 68 per cent in 2012 but that students selecting vegetables ate nearly 20 per cent more of them. In Philadelphia, not all of the new foods have gone over well. Beans are our challenge, Virus said. We accept that. We are trying."

This apart, the general inflation for rural India also rose from 4.35 percent to 4.47 percent, while for urban areas it fell a tad from 2.94 percent to 2.67 percent.In the case of wholesale index, prices continued in the negative territory during the last month. The WPI fell to (-)4.95 percent from (-)4.05 percent in July. The steep decline in August was mainly led by lower fuel prices.The annual rate of inflation, as per the official wholesale price index, stood at 3.85 percent in the corresponding month of the previous year, according to data released by the commerce and industry ministry.During the month under review, some commodities of mass consumption continued to upset household budgets and notably among them was onion, whose prices were higher by as much as 65 percent over the like month of the previous year. Pulses were dearer by 36 percent.Other protein-rich food items on the WPI such as milk, eggs, meat and fish recorded modest price increases. On a year-on-year (YoY) basis milk was costly by 2.08 percent, while eggs, meat and fish prices rose by 3.30 percent.At the same time potatoes and vegetables were cheaper by 52 percent and 21 percent, respectively. Even the prices of cereals and rice dwindled. Cereals depreciated by 1.65 percent and rice cheapened by 3.48 percent.Overall, WPI food articles' prices declined by 1.13 percent on a YoY basis.Even under the manufactured products category, prices of commodities pertaining to food fell -- especially sugar that was lower by 19 percent year-on-year.Under fuels -- the index for which was down 16.5 percent -- petrol was cheaper by 13.26 percent and diesel by 24.54 percent.

A few years ago, 1,800 hectare land was under potato cultivation, making it the major cash crop in the valley. However, potato crop has now been pushed to the third place. Both Kufri Jyoti and Kufri Chandermukhi varieties of seed potato produced in Lahaul are in danger.Amit Shashni of Goshal village said he has been cultivating cauliflower for last three years. ""It is more profitable than potato. Unfortunately, this year we are getting cheap prices for our produce as maximum farmers from the valley have grown similar crop and demand is less than production,"" he added.As far as the eye can see, vast farms of cauliflower can be seen spread till the horizon. Many farmers have cultivated vegetables in the apple orchards. According to experts, the cold and dry weather of Lahaul is perfect for vegetable production. However, unavailability of water is a problem in some places. Unlike other farms of the country where farmers are forced to spray pesticides on vegetables to kill pests, there are no pests in cold environment of Lahaul.""Cauliflowers of Lahaul are huge in size and colour is snow-white. We are transporting them to Kullu, Chandigarh, Punjab, Delhi and other parts of the country,"" another farmer Ajeet Sharma said. He added that he has cultivated potato and peas in a little portion of the land. ""I have also tried a hand at hops. But as its price was too low, I adopted potato farming and now major crop is cauliflower.""The main markets for Lahaul's seed potato are Gujarat, West Bengal, Punjab, Haryana, UP, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand and Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal also sourced it from here. Uncertainty of its production, hard work and fluctuation in prices are other reasons that led farmers to adopt other crops."

There were 40,000 in Shimla district alone.At present, agriculture crops are cultivated in 9 lakh hectares, while fruits are grown in 2.5 lakh hectares across the state.Maize, wheat, rice, potatoes and seasonal vegetables are the main crops, while fruits grown in Himachal are apple, mango, litchi, cherry, plum, apricot, pear, kinnow and lemon.LONGSTANDING PROBLEMA concern for successive state governments, the monkey problem in Himachal Pradesh is spread across 2,300 villages. From setting up primate parks to sterilising the monkeys, different strategies tried by the governments have failed to achieve much.Wild boars, blue bulls, hares and porcupines add to the problem.In view of the rising wild animal problem, the state government has set up a state-level committee to find a solution. Formed at the recently concluded Vidhan Sabha session, the committee is headed by the chief minister and has the leader of opposition besides experts as its members.THREAT TO HUMANSThe monkeys not only eat into the profits of farmers by destroying their crops, they are also a threat to humans. The man-monkey conflict is common in both rural and urban areas.In the past decade, monkeys have attacked 2,050 people, who have been given Rs 96 lakh in damages by the wildlife wing of the forest department.The government has so far sterilised 97,000 monkeys by spending Rs 19.4 crore, with the cost of sterilisation of a single monkey being Rs 2,000.Farmer bodies have been demanding that the government declare monkeys pests and allow their culling to control their population.The government has been boasting of sterilising monkeys but the problem persists. The only solution is allowing their export, says Satyawan Pundir, a member of non-governmental organisation Kheti Bachao Samiti.OUT OF CONTROLMonkey population: 2.26 lakhMonkey attacks on humans in decade: 2,050Relief disbursed for attacks: Rs 96 lakhMonkeys sterilised: 97,000Spent on sterilisation: Rs 19.4 croreMonkey hotspots: 1,141LOSS TO CROPS IN YEARAgriculture: Rs 185 croreHorticulture: Rs 38 croreArea under agriculture: 9 lakh hectaresArea under horticulture: 2.5 lakh hectares"
244,Food processing: Paste and powder solution for  high veggie prices has no takers,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/food-processing-paste-and-powder-solution-for-high-veggie-prices-has-no-takers/,2015-09-17,Indian Express,"A CIPHET scientist displaying packed dried onions. (Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh)Onions and potatoes are today witness to diametrically opposite trends.Consumers are shelling out Rs 60 per kg for the former, with even wholesale prices in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market ruling at Rs 4,100 per quintal, as against Rs 1,350 levels during this time last year. In the case of potatoes, however, farmers are the ones at the receiving end, with the tuber selling for Rs 550 per quintal in the Agra mandi, compared to Rs 1,850 a year ago. Prices were even lower, at Rs 300-350 per quintal in April, while the crop was being harvested.One way to deal with such extreme price fluctuations is to encourage consumption of onions and potatoes in processed form  as dried flakes, paste or even powder. This is something that even Union Food Processing Industries Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has suggested: If raw onions or potatoes, available cheap during harvest time, are converted into dehydrated products having longer shelf life, they can be sold to consumers in the lean season when fresh produce is costly.Share This Article Related Article In fact: Why restrictions on stockholding and export of pulses must goIn fact: Why restrictions on stockholding and export of pulses must go Onion lessonsOnion lessons Reverse of onions: Potato farmers at receiving end, as prices crashReverse of onions: Potato farmers at receiving end, as prices crash Whats in a bulbWhats in a bulb Your food is not cheaper yet, but wait a whileDried Onions to the rescueFarmers, too, gain if their excess harvested produce can be made into something that is less perishable, contributing to price stability.Potatoes are usually harvested from mid-December to April. Given water content of 80 per cent, these would rot in a few weeks unless kept in cold stores. But cold storage entails energy costs and occupation of space, often inadequate during peak arrivals and in times of glut.The Central Potato Research Institutes research station at Jalandhar has developed a technology for dehydration of potatoes to increase the shelf life of this semi-perishable crop by up to eight months.We have designed a mechanical unit where potatoes can be peeled, chopped and dried automatically. These can, then, be separately packed in polythene bags for storage, processing or cooking, says Ashiv Mehta, principal scientist at the station. The dehydrated potatoes can fully rehydrated at the time of cooking without losing the original flavor and taste. Also, this technology is amenable for processing all varieties of potato, she claims.Similar technology exists for drying of fresh onions (which also has over 85 per cent moisture content) and converting into flakes, paste and powder. The Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET) at Ludhiana has since 2007 been offering a special training course for processing of onions. The course incorporates licensing of its technology that gives a yield of 14-16 kg of dried flakes from every 100 kg of onions. The flakes, which can be stored for more than nine months, can be rehydrated in water before consumption to get 5-6 times of rehydrated onions.What is striking, though, is that there are few takers for these proven technologies. While CIPHET has conducted about 10 training sessions amongst groups of farmers with the idea that they start units based on its technology, not a single of these have so far come up in Punjab. The onion dehydration plants currently operational are concentrated around Bhavnagar in Gujarat and Nashik in Maharashtra. These units export the bulk of their dehydrated onion production, while selling small quantities domestically to institutional buyers like star hotels and restaurants.According to DN Yadav, senior scientist at CIPHET, Indian consumers arent used to the idea of onion flakes or powder. Mehta, likewise, admits that it isnt going to be easy to change the average consumer mindset, which is oriented towards using fresh potatoes for cooking.While some consumers may shift to dried onions or potato flakes, especially when raw produce becomes totally unaffordable, they would go back to the latter the moment prices ease to normal levels. This is obviously discouraging for any entrepreneur, who would want some assured or steady demand for his product.KBS Sidhu, a retired Punjab cadre Indian Administrative Service officer-turned-farmer, believes that onion processing will not pick up unless some big company steps in. Even if a farmer were to invest Rs 3-5 lakh in a small unit, who will market his product, more so given the current level of consumer awareness? he asks.The experience of even big farmer-entrepreneurs hasnt been very good either. Mandip Singh, who grows potatoes in over 1,000 acres in Jalandhar, set up Satnam Agri Products Ltd in 2007 for producing dehydrated potato flakes and frozen French fries. This plant, costing Rs 52.50 crore and which can process 36,000 tonnes of potatoes annually, is at present operating at a quarter of its capacity.Singh blames government apathy for the unit not doing well, despite supplying its products to the likes of McCain and Haldiram. Running a plant at full capacity requires huge sums of working capital to enable purchase and stocking up of potatoes at harvest time.The government can facilitate working capital through banks at reasonable interest rates. Neither has it done anything in this regard nor have we got the promised capital subsidy from the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, he complains.Meanwhile, not even a tenth of the 45 million tonnes potatoes and 19 million tonnes onions produced annually in India gets processed  which is bad for both consumers and producers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
245,Suppliers of Spurious Pesticides Will Not Be Spared: Punjab CM,http://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/suppliers-of-spurious-pesticides-will-not-be-spared-punjab-cm/story-4VILNnOT5iU7CFEWvQWR6I.html,2015-09-25,Hindustan Times,"Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal on Thursday said anyone found guilty of supplying spurious pesticides to the cotton cultivators in the state would not be spared at any cost.Winding up the discussion on the resolution moved by parliamentary affairs minister Madan Mohan Mittal on current agrarian crisis in the state here at Punjab Vidhan Sabha, the chief minister said he had already asked the special secretary, agriculture, to submit a detailed report on this contentious matter by September 30.To get to the bottom of the case, he had already ordered an inquiry to fix the responsibility of the erring officials and dealers involved in the sale of spurious pesticides by a special investigation team (SIT) of police, comprising three inspectors general of police (IGPs) under the direct supervision of additional director general of police (ADGP), crime.Badal said since the inquiry was in progress, it would be unfair on his part to comment on the matter at this point of time. However, he said that exemplary punishment would be ensured to the culprits who were involved in this immoral act, which would serve as a deterrent for such unscrupulous elements so that they should not dare to commit such offence in future.Joint expert group to recommend future strategy on pest attacksThe CM said in order to prevent the recurrence of such pest attacks in future a joint expert group of Punjab and Haryana has been formed to recommend future strategy. He said this expert group, comprising vice chancellors (VCs) and directors, research, PAU and HAU, deputy director general cotton, ICAR and director, Cotton Research Station, Sirsa as members, has been asked to suggest ways and means to tackle such problem effectively in future.Reiterating the firm commitment to fully compensate the cotton growers affected by the attack of whitefly, the CM said a special Girdawari was being done by the state government to ascertain the loss, which would be completed by the end of this month. He said the problem of whitefly had aggravated due to deficient rain during this season, resulting in harsh attack from whitefly on the cotton crop.Badal said they had already released Rs 10 crore for the payment of compensation to the farmers, who had already ploughed back their cotton crop extensively damaged due to attack from whitefly in an area of 11,780 acres, spreading over six districts of Malwa belt.CM urges Centre to present separate Agriculture BudgetCommending the adoption of this resolution unanimously to the Speaker, the CM urged the Government of India (GoI) to present a separate Agriculture Budget on the pattern of the Railway Budget, as majority of the nations population was dependent on agriculture. He said it was the need of hour to bail out farmers from current agrarian crisis.Badal said the Union government should also announce a farmer-friendly crop insurance scheme based on plot or field as a unit for assessing damage to the crop besides ensuring remunerative minimum support price (MSP) to the farmers for their produce.The CM also urged the GoI to evolve a mechanism of purchasing the alternate crops like maize and cotton at MSP so that farmers could be immensely benefitted from it. Badal said that provisions must be made by the Centre to ensure compensation of actual loss and include horticulture and livestock in the Calamity Relief Fund. I hope that the Union government will take a call on these issues to bail out the beleaguered farmer from the agrarian crisis, he added.Slams Cong govt for breaking backbone of peasantry in PunjabSlamming the successive Congress governments at the Centre for breaking the backbone of the peasantry of the state, the chief minister said due to the regressive policies of these governments, the farmers were reeling under a whopping debt of Rs 3,2000 crore. On the other hand, he said the SAD-BJP government has taken bold steps to get the farmers out of this crisis. He said during the last more than eight years the state government has provided free power to farmers worth Rs 28,000 crore, otherwise their problems would have accentuated manifolds on account of tube well bills.Likewise, the chief minister said during drought-like situation in 2014paddy season, the state government purchased additional power worth Rs 1,400 crore to meet increased demand of farmers. Badal said when the wheat crop of the farmers was damaged due to untimely rains in April 2015, the state government ensured that every grain was lifted. The state government took every step to resolve the impending sugarcane crisis by ensuring the payment of arrears to the farmers from private and cooperative sugar mills, he said.Listing the steps taken by the state government to safeguard the interests of farming community on one hand and supplement their income on the other, the chief minister said due to the strenuous efforts made by the state, Post Graduate Institute for Horticultural Research and Education was coming up at Amritsar. Likewise, he said prestigious institutes like Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA) in collaboration with CIMMYT, Mexico Indian Institute of Maize Research at Ladowal, Centre of Excellence on Vegetables & Citrus, Potatoes and Cotton have been set up at Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar and Bathinda. Badal said three mega food parks, two modern wood markets, seven maize dryers, besides 1,554 agro service centres have been set in the state.The chief minister said the state government has enhanced the compensation from Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh under the farmers suicide policy. Likewise, he said that due to concerted efforts of the state government, the NDA government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi had increased relief for loss from Rs 3,600 per acre to Rs 8,000 per acre. Badal said due to the endeavours of state government, the Union government has for the first time agreed to include loss of farm crop due to hailstorms, frost and pest attack in the category of natural calamities.Future plans to bail out the farmers from distressSpelling out the future plans to bail out the farmers from distress, the chief minister said after spending Rs 4,000 crore to strengthen the canal network in the state, the SAD-BJP alliance government was now spending Rs 2,175 crore for lining of Rajasthan and Sirhind feeder. He said head to tail concrete rejuvenation of Bist-Doab Canal would be done at Rs 320 crore, which would enhance the irrigation capacity of lifeline of Doaba six times, from existing 3,5000 hectares to 2 lakh hectares, adding that the work on this ambitious project would start from coming October. Likewise, he said the work on Kandi Canal would be completed by April 2016.The chief minister said it was a matter of great pride for them that under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Rs 1,371 crore has been approved for lining of water courses, underground pipes and drip irrigation in Jalandhar (Bist Doab canal), Hoshiarpur (Kandi canal) and Moga (Sidhwan canal). We are committed for the welfare of the hard working and resilient farmers of the state and all these pro-farmer initiatives will certainly help the farmers in bailing out from the current agrarian crisis he added."

247,What is deflation and is it bad?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/what-isdeflation-and-is-it-bad/article7693220.ece,2015-09-27,The Hindu,"With Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian first cautioning about impending deflation, and then in an interview to The Hindu clarifying that he meant deflation in a limited price-related context, it is a good time to explain the various contours of the rise and fall of prices.What is inflation?Inflation is simply a measure of the extent of increase in prices. If potatoes cost Rs.100 per kg in August 2014, and if they cost Rs.110 per kg in August 2015, then inflation in the price of potatoes was 10 per cent.When this happens across prices of all commodities for a relatively sustained period of time, then one can say the economy is experiencing inflation. Looking at consumer prices, India is still undergoing inflation. That is, prices are still increasing. For example, in August 2015, overall consumer prices were 3.7 per cent higher than they were in August 2014.So, then what does it mean when the government says inflation is coming down?All that means is that the rate of increase of prices is slowing. Going back to the example of potatoes, if they were Rs.110 per kg in August, then went to Rs.120 per kg in September, Rs.125 in October and Rs.127 in November, one can see that although the price is still going up, the rate of increase is decelerating.Is there a technical term for such a phenomenon?The U.S. Federal Reserve often uses the term disinflation to refer to a period where the rate of inflation has been slowing on a sustained basis.So, looking at the Consumer Price Index, India is currently technically going through a phase of disinflation. The rate of inflation as measured by the CPI was 10.7 per cent in August 2013, which came down to 3.7 per cent over the course of two years.So, then, what is deflation and why is there so much controversy and confusion around the term?Deflation is simply the opposite of inflation. That is, prices fall from one period to the next. The confusion comes from the fact that deflation has historically generally been accompanied by significant economic contraction. But that is not the case in India.Real GDP growth, the final figure that the government presents to you, is calculated by looking at how the value of the total production of the economy has changed compared to the previous year, and then reducing the effect of inflation/deflation from this. If the rate of growth of the economy and prices are both falling, then that is not a good place to be in  as it is usually accompanied by rising unemployment, lower demand, falling corporate earnings, reduced investments, etc.This gets exacerbated when people begin to expect prolonged deflation. If they expect that prices will be lower in the future, then people and companies both defer their investments and expenditure waiting for those lower prices. This postponement of expenditure hurts the economy. But slowing inflation coupled with about 7 per cent GDP growth and a pickup in domestic demand  as India is experiencing now  is not a bad thing in itself. Following an extended period of double-digit inflation, this cooling off of prices may just be a correction.Fun factThere is such a thing as hyperinflation, when the rate of increase of prices is beyond anything seen in normal circumstances. As one website succinctly defines it, Hyperinflation is a situation where the price increases are so out of control that the concept of inflation is meaningless.One famous example of hyperinflation was when French and Belgian troops invaded the industrial regions of the Weimar Republic (of World War I fame) to ensure the payment of war reparations.The Weimar Republics currency, the Mark, was at 320 Marks per dollar in the first half of 1922. By November 1923, the exchange rate was at 4,210,500,000,000 Marks per dollar."
248,Hoshiarpur Farmer Reaps Good Carrot Harvest,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/hoshiarpur-farmer-reaps-good-carrot-harvest/story-6Fjfy3IKZBb94zBMdjDPMO.html,2015-09-28,Hindustan Times,"Hoshiarpur: For the farmers stuck in debt trap, Gurcharan Singh, a farmer of Bohan village, can be an inspiration who has scripted a success story in carrot cultivation. His is the first crop that arrives in the state market on the onset of the carrot season. With sheer hard work and scientific approach, he is reaping rich dividends.Instead of looking for an alternate profession when he was young, the 40-year-old decided to carry forward his familys agriculture business. He ventured in to crop diversification as far back as early nineties and brought major part of his land under vegetables. He grows three crops in rotation-wheat, potato and carrot but the thrust is on the root vegetable. At present he is growing carrots in 90 acres of land in Bohan, Bassi Kikran, Nara, Jatpur and Bassi Daud Khan villages. He has taken land on lease also to raise carrot crop.Right from the beginning, I have been getting good price for carrots. My family has been producing own germination since many years, he claims and hopes that one day they might launch their brand of seeds.Gurcharan starts early sowing of carrot in the last week of August and by November beginning, the crop is ready. Mine is the first crop to arrive, not only in Punjab but in other parts of the country also. The early crop brings good remuneration, he claims. The produce depends on the climate. Production per acre ranges from 50 to 200 quintals, he adds.The progressive farmer adopts modern techniques to pluck, wash and package the crop. If a farmer wants to get good market price, he will have to evolve and follow modern practices, he maintains.Gurcharan markets his produce in various districts of Punjab. I prefer to sell carrots outside Hoshiarpur as the local market is monopolized by traders who do not give much profit to the grower. One of the reasons why the farmers do not go for diversified crops is the presence of middlemen. The end user gets vegetables and fruits at high rates but the profit does not go to the producer, he laments.He claims to harvest profit up to Rs one lakh per acre from carrot cultivation. He has never grown paddy in his fields as considers the traditional crop a bane for water resources."

Whereas just two years ago, there was a good market of these tractors.Those in the business claim that it is the worst phase in farm economy in two years because of the low yield of wheat last season, constant low yield and prices of cotton, huge loss to potato growers and now the whitefly attack on cotton and the poor returns from basmati.Farmers buy new tractors that are financed by banks, but unable to pay the loan, they sell them off, which are mostly bought by traders, says Pargat Singh of Hari Ke Kalan village of Muktsar, who had brought his Swaraj and Ford tractors for sale.Two years ago, the situation was different as about 10 tractors were bought by farmers from around 30 sold every Sunday. But now we hardly find one or two customers. A farmer is ready to sell his tractor for Rs 5 lakh that he had bought for Rs 6.35 lakh only four months ago. But so far, there are no takers, says Kaur Singh Maluka, who is into selling these.Hardeep Singh from Khara says, Farmers are badly in debt and they are trying to come out of the situation by selling their agricultural implements. The cotton on my six acres was damaged and basmati prices are too low this season. Owing to these problems, I am ready to sell my relatively new tractor, but there are no customers.Most farmers have no money to buy a tractor. They are rather selling it but there are no takers. The situation was totally different two years ago when we were able to sell about 10 tractors. But now, till the afternoon, we have failed to find any customer. Maybe, as the day wears off, we are able to sell one or, at most, two tractors, says Labh Singh, an organiser."

252,Strike cloud on perishable goods,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1151004/jsp/odisha/story_46072.jsp,2015-10-04,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, Oct. 3: The indefinite nationwide strike called by the All India Motor Transport Congress has started to make its impact on the availability of the essential commodities in the state, especially on the perishable goods. The consumers are worried as the prices are likely to shoot from Monday. ""Ours is not a producing and manufacturing state. So, we depend upon procurement of all essential commodities, be it potato, onion, dal, fish, chicken, egg, vegetables, fruits or anything else from other states. The truck strike, therefore, has its impact on the supply of these commodities,"" said Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangh general secretary Sudhakar Panda. The motor transport congress had called for the indefinite strike from October 1 to press for its demand for removal of tollgates from the country. Panda said he had asked all the district units to keep adequate stocks ahead of the truck strike to ensure availability of essential commodities. ""I appeal the government to take the traders into confidence and ensure the availability of essential commodities in adequate quantity,"" he said. Panda also appealed to the consumers not to go for panic buying, which would create artificial scarcity of the commodities. Panda said scarcity of fish, eggs, potato, onion and raw vegetables would be felt first as these are perishable goods. ""The government should ensure the preservation of these commodities in cold storages. The truckers should also exempt these commodities,"" he said. An Odisha State Truck Owners' Association member said essential commodities and perishable goods such as milk, vegetables and medicine had been kept off the strike's purview. Joint secretary of the Cuttack Chamber of Commerce Srikant Sahoo said the strike had affected the loading and unloading of essential commodities at Malgodown, the largest wholesale market of the state. ""We have booked orders for the goods. But as the trucks are not coming, the loading and unloading at Malgodown have stopped. The labourers are sitting idle,"" he said. Sahoo said: ""If the strike continues for a longer period, it will have an adverse impact on the supply of essential commodities within a couple of days."" Besides an association member said that as the state was dependent on its neighbouring states for commodities such as egg, potato, onion and vegetables, the strike would create artificial shortage of these commodities. Kuberpuri Merchants' Association general secretary Shakti Shankar Mishra said only 20 trucks had come on Thursday to the wholesale godown in the city, but no truck had come thereafter. The potato-laden trucks from Bengal have been stranded near Balasore, he said, adding that 25 truckloads of potato (around 400 metric tonnes) used to come to the godown every day before the strike. ""The stock has been exhausted. Whatever local produces come to the godown they are being exhausted within a few minutes. These potatoes are also drenched and of substandard quality,"" said Mishra. In another development, the potato prices have gone up in the city. While the price was Rs 7 to Rs 7.50 on September 30, it soared up to Rs 15 to Rs 16 a kg in the wholesale market and to Rs 25 in the retail market. Chhatra Bazar Traders' Association president Debendra Sahu said: ""The vegetables and potato stocks are about to be exhausted. The situation will be precarious within a day or two as the festive season approaches fast,"" he said. The Dwitiya festival, during which the people of the state prepare mixed vegetable dish, will be held on Monday. The traders rued that both the central and state governments did not hold meetings with the traders to take contingency measures even though the truckers had given notice months before the strike."

Its truly an out-of-the-world film, which argues that humans, when pushed to a corner, would find a way to even grow potatoes on Mars. If you thought Tom Hanks surviving on an island in Cast Away was traumatic, you must watch The Martian .The film begins with a storm. Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and her crew  save for Mark, who is presumed dead  make it out. But Mark is alive  just barely. What ensues is the story of a man, who acts on his survival instincts. He just sciences the shit out of everything. The plot unfolds with the help of breathtaking cinematography that showcases the expansive horizons of Mars, while at the same time capturing Marks intimate struggle inside a bunker.This is a film for science geeks, who might either be taken in by the film, or enjoy poking fun at the science. The best part is that the science stuff in the film barely matters. What matters is how Mark overcomes seemingly impossible, life-threatening obstacles  what to eat and drink, and how to establish contact with Earth to give himself the slightest chance of survival.Matt Damon is fantastic. We know so little about his family and friends, and yet, his screen presence helps us identify with him throughout. The film also features a solid performance from Jeff Daniels ( The Newsroom ), who plays the NASA chief, and is often forced to think hard about existential questions and the cost of rescuing stranded astronauts.There are a number of motifs tucked into the film, such as the American spirit to endure and survive, and NASAs superiority when it comes to space research. The Martian reiterates how much we have achieved in terms of scientific advancement, and yet theres so much we dont know about.The Martian is truly the most audacious, out-of-the-world film about human survival in recent times.udhav naigThe MartianDirector:Ridley ScottCast:Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kate MaraStoryline:A botanist stranded on Mars is determined to make it back home."

As the truckers' stir entered its fourth consecutive day on Sunday, supply of goods to various parts of the country has been affected with vendors predicting a steep rise in the prices of vegetable and essential commodies from Monday.The All India Motor Transport Congress, which represents the truckers, is demanding the scrapping of the existing toll system, seeking a one-time payment of taxes and simplification of the TDS procedure.According to R Soundararajan, former advisor to the Koyambedu Market Wholesalers' Association, 270 trucks came into Koyambedu market on Saturday but only 250 trucks came in on Sunday. ""We had to pay the driver at least 3,000 extra to ply,"" he said. On a regular day around 350 lorries bring in vegetables here. ""If the strike is stronger tomorrow and not enough trucks come in, the vegetable prices will shoot up,"" he said.The retail price of tomatoes dropped from Rs 30 to Rs 25 on Sunday. Beans, beetroot, yam were being sold at lower prices while potatoes and carrots were costlier by Rs 3 and Rs 5.Milk distribution in Chennai is also likely to be affected next week, according to vendors. So far, trucks carrying essential commodities were exempted from the strike. The truckers association has said it would block all trucks from Monday.Around 27 lakh litres of milk is brought into the city each day. While private milk is around 16 lakh litres, Aavin brings in 10.5 lakh litres. ""We have enough stock for the next two days but if the strike continues there is a problem on hand as being a perishable commodity, milk cannot be stored for long,"" said a senior Aavin official. Private milk distribution is also likely to be affected.Meanwhile, political parties issued statements on the loss of business and the impact on the state. DMK president M Karunanidhi said that goods were lying unused and supply of vegetables and perishable goods to Koyambedu Vegetable market and other parts of the state had dropped by 20 per cent. The Central government, he said, has lost 2,000 crore, state has lost 200 crore and lorry owners in Tamil Nadu have lost 10.5 crore due to the strike.PMK founder-leader S Ramadoss said more than seven lakh trucks in Tamil Nadu and 93 lakh trucks in the country did not ply since October 1, resulting in stagnation of products worth 35,000 crore and goods across the country."

""Earlier, I used to buy vegetables from the vendors that come to the colony but I realised they inflate the prices very frequently.

Loving dads cook these vegetables at home instead of ordering a takeaway. But there is a chilling defect in this wellness scheme: Dangerously high levels of pesticides have made a lot of Indias vegetable supply more of a health hazard than boon. The 2014-15 report on monitoring pesticide residues at the national level shows that vegetables accounted for over 56% of the samples which had pesticides above the maximum residue level set by the food regulator. Major culprits include brinjal, cabbage, capsicum, cauliflower, coriander, green chilli, okra, spinach and tomato. Its a malady spread from Delhi to Hyderabad, Mumbai to Kolkata.Pesticides are being used many times above the permissible limit. Dangerous and banned pesticides are also being used. Many are introduced at the farm level and others at the transportation and retail levels. Organic and home-grown solutions cannot supply to necessary scale. As for more intense inspections and tests, even these can only have limited effectivity given how heavily both the farm and retail sectors are fragmented. Consolidation and modernisation show the real way forward. Monitoring food safety and enforcing standards is much more doable in a modern supply chain. Also, studies have shown that organised retail yields higher average price realisation for farmers than government regulated and middleman dominated mandis, thus reducing the incentive for breaking the safety rules.The real future lies in pesticide-resistant GM crops. For example, across the world trials of pest resistant varieties of brinjal, broccoli, cabbage, potato and tomato are being watched with excitement. India continuing to hold its nose on GM isnt wise. So long as we refuse to modernise our food production and distribution systems the poisoned veggies problem  along with others such as farmers distress  will only grow worse."

The prices have increased up to Rs 300 since September.This (price rise) is because of the festival season as consumption patterns change to accommodate a purely vegetarian diet and residents also tend to go for a protein-rich diet. In local markets, the retail prices of pulses ranges between Rs 75 and Rs 140. Even vegetable prices have increased this month, said Roop Singh, senior inspector from the department.The wholesale prices of vegetables like potato and tomato have also increased to Rs 690 and Rs 1,560, respectively, per 100kg. The two commonly used veggies cost Rs 621 and Rs 840, respectively, per 100kg in September.The increase in wholesale prices is not much. But sometimes commodities are sold in the retail market with a profit margin of more than 100%. The retail prices follow market trends and depend on various factors, Singh said.However, the wholesale prices of other vegetables like onion and cauliflower have shown a decline and stood at Rs 3,550 and Rs 950 per 100kg, respectively, during the current month. Last month, the two items were priced at Rs 3,725 and Rs 2,045 per 100kg, respectively.Wholesale prices of fruits like papaya, pomegranate and guava have increased while wholesale prices of banana and apple have decreased.In the retail market, the price of onion is in the range of Rs 65 per kg, cauliflower Rs 40 per kg, tomato Rs 52 per kg, brinjal Rs 28 per kg and potato at Rs 17 per kg.The prices of fruits have also been rising. Banana is being sold for Rs 42 per kg, papaya at Rs 41 per kg and guava at Rs 62 per kg. Apple is being sold for Rs 210 per kg and pomegranate at Rs 165 per kg.The fruit prices always increase during festivals. The vegetable prices will witness a marginal increase till the end of the festival season. However, the prices of pulses may see a dip by October-end as the government has ordered for a major import of pulses. So, their prices may decrease when import consignments arrive, Singh said.Residents said with the prices heading north, they are finding it hard to balance their budgets. People said they are more worried as festivals are approaching and the expenses might go up further.Durga Puja is approaching and the prices have already increased a lot. If the prices of daily consumption items keep increasing like this, it will definitely dig a hole in our pockets, said Arundhati Banerjee, a resident of Indirapuram.We gift fruits to our relatives when we visit them during the festivals. But with the prices of fruits increasing like this, we dont know what to do, said Namita Prakash, a resident of Vaishali."

Now she is worried who will pay her school fee and that of her younger brother. Their father, Sukhmandar Singh, was found hanging from a tree in their village, Behman Diwana, in Bathinda district on October 5. The village does not talk about who he left behind  aging parents, a wife and two children  but how much he owes to whom.Sukhmanders own landholding of three acres was never enough and though the contract price of `40,000 an acre seemed difficult to pay, he took three acres on theka (contract) hoping for a good cotton crop. His wife, Bhinder Kaur, says she has now no time to grieve. He had paid half the amount for the three acres taken on theka. There is another `3 lakh we owe the arhtiya (commission agent). Our crop has been ruined by whiteflies. My husband would worry about how to repay the debt but I never imagined he could take such an extreme step, leaving behind our children. How will I ever repay the loans and educate them? she says.The tragedy has revisited the family more than a decade after Sukhmanders younger brother, Resham Singh, committed suicide following the American bollworm attack that wiped out the cotton crop. Since the genetically modified Bt cotton variety came to Punjab, the village had seen no suicides though its farming had become a losing proposition as land contract, labour and input costs spiralled as cotton prices fell.WEDDINGS CALLED OFFThe wife (left), parents and brothers of Charnjeet Singh in Banawali village, Mansa.

It is the worst-ever cotton crisis to hit the state, which is the fourth largest producer of the crop in the country, at 1.8 million bales (of 170 kg each) with the highest yield of 800 kg/hectare. But this year, not only has the whitefly attack and crop failure sent the rural economy into a tailspin, the crisis has also taken a toll on rural society.Fields, which at this time of the year used to glisten with white gold, wear a black, smoky look as the whitefly has sapped the life out of cotton flowers and the farmers. The gloom is taking a human and social toll as distressed farmers are cancelling marriage palace bookings, some even their own weddings. Tractors are being sold and jewellery mortgaged.Unable to pay the fee, children of small cotton farmers are dropping out of school. At least 17 suicides have been reported in the past two months, mainly in Bathinda and Mansa districts.DEBTS PILE UPDaughters and wife of Bikkar Singh of Kheeva Khurd village in Mansa show the picture of Bikkar and his son, Satguru, who had committed suicide 4 years back. (Sanjeev Sharma/HT)At Burj Mehma village of Bathinda, a family has seen suicide attempts by two brothers within 22 days. The younger, Charanjit Singh, died on September 9 after consuming pesticide. Unable to deal with the crisis, his elder brother, Charna, too attempted suicide but was saved.Our brothers took loans to marry us off. Charanjit had taken money from my husband to repay his tractor loan. But still my brothers owe nearly `7-8 lakh, including the price for taking five acres on contract and advance from the arhtiya. After his cotton crop was ruined, Charanjit went to the field on September 9 and never came back, says his sister Veerpal. Unable to repay loans, Charanjits own marriage was never an option.Their mother, Jarnail Kaur, is now struggling to get Charna treated as he is still mentally unstable. It has added another `70,000 to the debt of the family. Sitting next to the harvested cotton, Jarnails brother, Mangal Singh, says when debts pile up, one bad year can make the burden unbearable. Normally, we got a minimum of 10 quintals from an acre. This year, we got 3 quintals from five acres. When the land is taken on contract, the owner wont spare us the contract price if there is crop failure nor will the arhtiya his loan. The patwari (revenue official) came for assessing the crop loss but we have received no compensation. Perhaps it has gone to the landlord, he says. The district administration is considering cases of both Sukhmandar and Charanjit for higher compensation of ` 3 lakh under farm suicide. The compensation for more than 33 percent cotton crop loss has been hiked by the government to ` 8000 an acre from the earlier ` 3600 an acre.Their names are similar and so are their stories. Charanjeet Singh of Banawali village in Mansa was the second among three sons. Their four-acre land stands undivided as Charanjeet was the only one who got married. On September 10, he went to his field and was found hanging from a tree the next morning. The family owes over `4 lakh for taking 12 acres on contract for growing cotton, ` 3 lakh to the arhtiya and ` 4 lakh to the bank. He has left behind grieving old parents and two sons, aged 9 and 3 years.He used to keep talking about the pesticide spray not being able to control the whitefly attack on narma (cotton). In six months, we spent ` 15,000 an acre on pesticides and seeds. Yet the crop failed. Even when the crop is good, we save nothing. Saanu kuch nai bachda. Asi te mitti naal mitti ho ke reh gaaye aa (We are left with nothing to save. We have been reduced to dust), says his wife, Karamjit Kaur. A month later, Charanjeet has been considered a genuine case of cotton failure related suicide by the district administration entitling his family to receive ` 3-lakh compensation from the government.In most families that have seen suicides, the debt trap is vicious  other than outstanding loans, even the little land and jewellery they own lies mortgaged with the arhtiya. In these families, those who committed suicide were the breadwinners, dealing with landlords and arhtiyas and buying and selling the produce. In some, they were the only one.TENANT on his own landRimpy, 15, who had topped Class 9, is now worried who will pay her school fee and that of her younger brother after their father, Sukhmandar Singh, was found hanging from a tree. (Sanjeev Sharma/HT)Reduced to a tenant on his own land, Bikkar Singh, 55, of Kheeva Khurd village in Mansa took on contract his own 1.5 acres from the moneylender whom he had mortgaged it to. He had also mortgaged his wifes jewellery for marrying off their three daughters. Though Bikkar had settled one of his loans in a lok adalat, ` 2.5 lakh still remained. He had to pay another` 60,000 for the land as contract price at the rate of `40,000 an acre this year.On October 7, Bikkar went to his cotton field and jumped into a nearby canal. Four years ago, his only son, Satguru Singh, then 16, had committed suicide after the marriage of his third sister. He too, his sisters claim, was depressed over their economic condition.Sitting next to them, their mother, Vidya Devi, says she had no money to even perform the last rites of her husband. The village collected the money for the cremation. My daughters will go back to their homes. I will be left alone. I have no education to earn a living, she said.Bikkars neighbours Gurbaksh Singh and Beant Singh, who too are small farmers with four acres each, fear more indebted farmers may meet this fate. But we have our own land to tide over the crisis. In Bikkars farm, just one quintal of cotton crop could be salvaged. That too is in the field awaiting compensation after several rounds of assessment by the patwari, they said.But Bikkars name was quick to make it to the list of genuine cases soon after his suicide as an embattled Parkash Singh Badal government tries to firefight angry farmer unions and protests by the Opposition. The department of disaster management has asked the administration of suicide-hit districts to promptly verify deaths related to cotton failure and grant not just ` 3 lakh compensation but also subsidised inputs and other assistance to the family to help it recover from the debt trap.Trigger for suicides?The opposition Congress is now questioning if the grant of ` 3 lakh to farmers committing suicide and meagre compensation to others hit by the crop failure would not prove as a trigger for more suicides. Does the government want more farmers to take their lives? They are publishing ads that compensation for suicides has been hiked since July this year to ` 3 lakh from` 2 lakh. For others, it is `8000 an acre. Why cant it compensate all those who have lost their crop? says Ajit Inder Singh Mofar, the Congress MLA from Sardulgarh in Mansa district.The compensation we received was as bitter as the harvest, says the family of Kuldeep Singh, 28, of Chuge Kalan in Bathinda. Kuldeeps suicide had rocked the Punjab Assembly as it was in session when he consumed poison at a protest rally of farmers in Bathinda. Ironically, three days after he died, his family received a cheque for ` 50 from the government!We had taken 15 acres on contract in addition to our own land of five acres, half of it was under cotton and rest under basmati. We have to pay the contract price, loan to arhityas and the bank. Even our jewellery is lying mortgaged as the situation is getting bad to worse. The land contract prices and cost of seeds, labour and pesticides are all shooting up but cotton prices are falling. Whiteflies attack every year but sprays work. This time they didnt.Now with a failed crop, we are doomed. I am not even in a position to pay school fee of my two daughters and the power bill, says Kuldeeps brother Hardeep Singh. While Kuldeeps wife and son had gone to meet her parents, his aged parents, are still inconsolable. Fasla te phir ho jangiya. Sada munda wapis kade nai ayega (The crop will grow again but our son will never return), says his father Thana Singh. Following hard bargaining by protesting farmer unions, the district administration has decided to pay a higher compensation of `5 lakh to Kuldeeps family.Youth in distressThe distress in farms is plunging the youth into deeper despair. There are no jobs and Punjabs youth who do not want to work on farms mostly take to drugs. My father slogs and takes loans to raise crops throughout the year. Cotton is wiped out and basmati prices have crashed. We had to sell potatoes at `1 a kilo after the glut. He has to drive to make ends meet.I would rather earn little in a private job than toil in the field. Only farms of big farmers are sprawling, the rest are turning into graveyards, says Jasveer Singh, 22, of Behman Diwana in Bathinda, who is studying at Punjabi University, Patiala.MURDER BY GOVERNMENTInderjit Jaijee, who has done extensive research on farm suicides in Punjab and is fighting cases for compensation, blames fragmentation of landholdings and unprofitability of agriculture for the crisis. The land keeps getting divided between brothers. The crop prices are not enough to sustain those with landholdings between one to four acres. The cotton belt in Punjab has no industry and therefore no jobs. Farmers have to rely on agriculture and if the crop fails, there is no insurance. So, farmers trapped in debt die. The insensitivity of the government makes it worse. We are fighting cases of 900 farmers (who committed suicide) in the Punjab and Haryana high court. The government has made post-mortem mandatory along with affidavit from the village panchayat, certifying the death as farm distress-related suicide. The compensation for crop failure is too little, too late. The suicides are actually a shameful act of murder by the government, Jaijee adds."

My daughter's education became costly. I went to Dhaka to be a maid or garment worker. But the wages were abysmal,"" she said, declining to give the name of her broker.Police, however, tell a different story. They suspect the relatives talked her into going ahead with the operation -- part of a growing web in Kalai of donors who turn brokers, taking a commission for anyone they successfully recruit.""This year alone 40 people from Kalai have sold their kidneys,"" local police chief Sirajul Islam told AFP, and 200 villagers since 2005.Another 12 villagers are currently missing, suspected to have travelled across the nearby border to India to hospitals to have the operations.""Those who have sold kidneys have themselves turned brokers and agents and became part of this huge organ trade network,"" Islam said.""These agents first target their families and relatives and then villagers.""Some eight million Bangladeshis suffer from kidney disease, mostly because of high rates of diabetes, and at least 2,000 need transplants annually.But donation is only legal between living relatives, resulting in a chronic shortage of kidneys for transplant.A lucrative blackmarket has filled the void, with a steady stream of desperate buyers and equally desperate and poor donors.After police busted a major scheme in 2011 involving doctors, nurses and clinics, many of the illegal surgeries moved to India.""This racket has a lot of influential people on their pay rolls,"" said Mustafizur Rahman, a Bangladesh nephrologist.""They can easily prepare all papers including fake passports and national identity cards in order to facilitate unlawful transplants.""Unnamed operatives gave Ara a fake passport in Bangladesh and ID card -- once blood tests matched her to a recipient.""They changed my name to Nishi Akter so that I could be passed off as his cousin. They said it was needed to convince the Indian clinic where doctors removed my kidney,"" Ara said.Petrified and alone, she was taken across the border for the surgery once she was deemed healthy.""On the day of the operation I was frozen with fear. I prayed to almighty Allah again and again.""Ara was paid $4,500 which she spent on leasing farmland to grow potatoes and rice. She hired tutors for her 13-year-old daughter who wants to be a doctor.But the money came at a price. She can no longer lift heavy objects, tires easily and often struggles to breathe.""Selling the kidney was a big mistake. I need costly medicine to stay well,"" she said.Almost every household in Kalai, 300 kilometres (185 miles) northwest of the capital Dhaka, has someone with the tell-tale, foot-long scar from the operation.Most suffer health problems because of poor post-surgery care, and can no longer labour on the farms. Some instead become brokers, earning up to $3,000 for each villager they sign up, Islam said.""A donor can easily convince a potential seller that he/she has nothing to lose by selling a kidney,"" said Moniruzzaman Monir of Michigan State University, who has done extensive research in Kalai.""He projects himself as a success story,"" said Monir, likening the racket in Kalai to a so-called financial ""pyramid scheme"".Last month, police cracked down on the trade, arresting a dozen people in Kalai and Dhaka, including a donor turned ""kingpin"".Authorities were spurred into action after a criminal gang cut out a six-year-old boy's kidney and dumped his body in a pond.Police and local authorities have also launched campaigns warning of the dangers, distributing leaflets to homes, schools and madrassas in the area.But many in Kalai doubt much will change, saying previous efforts have failed, thanks to an inefficient criminal justice system.Abdus Sattar, one of five arrested in 2011 for allegedly kickstarting the trade, is back in business, according to villagers.""The cases against them are going on at a glacial pace. Unless exemplary punishment is handed down to these kingpins and the trials are fast-tracked, there is no way this trade will stop,"" Monir said.One of Ari's neighbours, Shukkur Ali, received $5,350 for selling his kidney in neighbouring Sri Lanka. But the 21-year-old has been hospitalised three times in the last six months with complications.""I am lucky the buyer of my kidney paid for the treatment. But I know many villagers who got only a pittance. They're facing a slow death,"" he said."
262,NFR decries blockade culture,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1151017/jsp/northeast/story_48463.jsp,2015-10-17,Telegraph,"Protesters block tracks. File picture Guwahati, Oct. 16: Blockades have virtually put brakes on trains in Assam and other areas under the jurisdiction of Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) this year. According to NFR authorities, frequent blockades have hit rail traffic with as many as 78 protests staged between January and September this year. ""These rail roko protests by various groups have not only caused great inconvenience to passengers but also caused huge losses to the railways,"" NFR public relations officer Nripendra Bhattacharya told The Telegraph today. He said since the movement of trains is planned along certain traffic corridors and movement of one train has a bearing on the other trains plying ahead of and after it, the blockade of one train disrupts a large number of passenger and goods trains in that section. Section 174 of the Railways Act, 1989, says anyone who obstructs train traffic shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to two years, or with fine that may extend to Rs 2,000, or with both. ""The aftereffects of such blockades last for many days after the agitation programmes are called off as crucial activities like rake maintenance, crew planning, rake planning also get hampered. Trains originating from NFR, which are delayed because of agitation are accorded less priority as far as path allotment is concerned, when they travel through other railways, resulting in the trains losing punctuality all along its journey path,"" Bhattacharya said. ""These rail roko agitations cause much inconvenience to passengers, especially patients travelling for medical treatment, women travelling with children, students travelling for admissions and youths for job interviews,"" he said. ""Sometimes, rail roko protests lead to cancellation and termination of trains midway. There is a provision that passengers can seek ticket refund if their trains are detained or delayed by over three hours at a place. So in such cases, the railways also suffers financial loss because of ticket refund,"" Bhattacharya said. The railways, however, get worst hit because of blockade of freight movement during agitations. ""Apart from the losses suffered by the railways, delay in the movement of goods trains lead to damage of perishables like potatoes and in extreme cases also leads to scarcity of essential items in markets, adding to the woes of common people,"" he said. Businessmen transporting goods through trains also incur losses because of rail roko agitations. Bhattacharya said organisations should desist from disrupting train services as it does not solve any problem and causes unnecessary harassment to innocent travellers. ""There are other ways by which public grievances can be brought to the notice of higher authorities, including submission of memorandums and discussions,"" he said. Frequent strikes and blockades is a major problem in Assam. In June-July this year, there had been around 15 strikes and blockades in a span of just three weeks. An affidavit, submitted by the Assam government in Gauhati High Court recently, stated that a dawn-to-dusk bandh in 2014 had cost the exchequer Rs 43.28 crore. The affidavit further stated that 68 strikes, called by different organisations last year, had resulted in a total loss of Rs 29,431.25 crore to the state."
263,Dip in potato price robs the puja sheen in Hooghly,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Dip-in-potato-price-robs-the-puja-sheen-in-Hooghly/articleshow/49460578.cms,2015-10-20,The Times Of India,"HOOGHLY: The farmers are selling potatoes at Rs 3 per kg in Tarakeswar, Pursura and Arambagh, but people in Kolkata are buying the same potatoes at Rs 10 (Jyoti variety) and Rs 14-16 (Chandramukhi variety). The sudden dip in price of potatoes has robbed the sheen of the festive spirit in the vast rural belt of Hooghly, which thrives on potato economy.Along with dipping potato price, the uncertainty also looms large with industries of Hooghly. On Monday, a wife of a worker of closed down jute mill committed suicide on a day when the jute mill reopened after suspension work for six months. Rakhi Mohanti, 21, wife of Shankar Mohanti, a worker of drawing department of Victoria Jute Mill, committed suicide apparently for not being able to withstand the acute poverty.While other jute mills are functioning, but workers alleged an ill-payment. While in Bihar an average labourer gets Rs 300 per day, a jute mill worker gets Rs 165 per day. ""What puja are you talking about babu, when we are losing our sleep over two square of meal,"" said Raghunath Pansari, a jute mill worker in Bansberia.Two of major sources of jobs - Hindustan Motor and Dunlop - have perpetuated the nightmare. While one has shut its shop down, other exists only symbolically. Dunlop has not had any production since its reopening a year ago. The workers gets a token salary of Rs 5,000 per month. Moreover, the factory authority has recently informed a major theft from the plant, making the possibility of any production in near future impossible.Against this back-drop, Hooghly, the biggest producer of potatoes in the state, banked on potato price. Last year, potato -growers got its price, thanks to skyrocketing price. But this year, there is no sign of such rise of price. But the fall of potato price to Rs 3 per kg has robbed farmers of their last hope. ""We grow to lose. Last year, we made distress sale after good production. Middlemen took the profit home. This year, we hoarded expecting a price to rise, but now potato price is steadily dipping,"" said Balaram Ghosh, a farmer of Tarakeswar.But the price farmer gets is unlikely to reflect in selling price at urban centres, where the potatoes reaches via many hands of middle-men. ""The 'ready aloo' (sorted and coloured potatoes) is priced at Rs 260 per bag of 50 kg at the cold-storages. Per kg of potatoes is priced at Rs 5.2. But the same potatoes is selling at Rs 10 - 12 per kg. Just imagine how the middlemen taking away all the cream,"" said Gautam Das, another retailer at Pursura."
264,"After toor dhal, veggies cost dear",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-toor-dhal-veggies-cost-dear/article7782927.ece,2015-10-20,The Hindu,"to dizzy heights:The price of toor dhal has shot up to Rs. 200 putting consumers to hardship.- Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyConsumers in Vellore who are struggling with the skyrocketing price of toor dhal, are now forced to spend more on vegetables too in the coming weeks.The pulses market is offering no solace for consumers, with a kilo of toor dhal ( thuvaram parappu ), one of the essential cooking ingredients, now being sold for Rs. 180 to Rs. 200, according to traders.The soaring rate is a cause for worry for consumers like Radhika, a resident of Vellore. I cook sambar for at least two days in a week. With the rates shooting up, I am thinking of reducing the amount of dhal in our preparations, she said.C. Janarthanam, secretary of Vellore Navathaaniya Mandi Vyabarigal Sangam said the rate of toor dhal had remained stable at Rs. 100 to Rs. 130 for three months.The prices rise began early this month. Last month, a kilo of toor dhal was Rs. 130. Now, it has increased by more than Rs. 50- 60, he said.In fact, the prevailing rate is Rs. 100 - 120 more than the opening rate of toor dhal in January this year. The new stock of pulses comes up for sale every January.When compared to other pulses, the difference in rate is an all time high only for toor dhal. The change in price of urad dhal is not much, while there is a Rs. 5 difference in the opening and prevailing rate of Bengal gram, and Rs. 10 for green gram dhal ( payatham paruppu ), he added.A kilo of urad dhal costs Rs. 150 to 160, while Bengal gram is priced at Rs. 66 and green gram dhal at Rs. 110-115. Though Bengal gram will be purchased more for making sweets for Ayudha Pooja, the price has not increased, he added.Pulses are key essential commodities. Hike in price of the toor dhal has resulted in dip in demand. Those who purchase two kilos are now buying only half a kilo, he mentioned.He suggested that consumers can purchase dal imported from Turkey and masoor dal (pink lentil) that costs within Rs. 100. This price rise is not permanent. The harvest season is a few months away and new stock of pulses will arrive. The government is also taking measures to control the prices, Mr. Janarthanam said.Meanwhile, on its part, the Vellore District Consumers Cooperative Wholesale Stores Ltd (Karpagam Supermarket), is taking steps to offer toor dhal at lesser price for consumers.Mostly, rates at the supermarket are lesser than the prevailing market rates. A kilo of toor dhal was sold for Rs. 151 till two days ago at the supermarket. This stock has been exhausted, and new stock is being purchased from National Consumer Cooperative Federation, an officer said.Traders also point out that online trading and hoarding was one of the main reasons for escalation of prices.Vegetables tooVegetable prices, too, have started to rise in the last one week. Traders say that rains have affected the produce in parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam said rates of most of the vegetables have increased by at least Rs. 10.Damage to the produce has led to decline in supply. As a result, the prices have gone up. The rates are likely to increase in the coming weeks, he added.A kilo of tomatoes cost Rs. 20-25, onions Rs. 25-30 (new stock) and Rs. 50-(old), small onions - Rs. 30, potatoes  Rs. 25, brinjal  Rs. 40, beans  Rs. 40, carrot  Rs. 30-Rs.40, cabbage-Rs. 15, drumstick  Rs. 50, radish  Rs. 30, hladys finger- Rs. 30, ginger  Rs. 30 (new) and Rs. 60 (old), beetroot  Rs. 20, snake gourd  Rs. 15, avarakkai-Rs. 40, peas  Rs. 150 and coriander  Rs. 40 a bunch."

Holding the NDA government responsible for skyrocketing prices of essential commodities and food inflation, Akhilesh advised the BJP to implement policies to increase farm productivity instead of resorting to importing pulses and food grains.He said, ""The Centre is responsible for the price rise. It should come forward to curb it. During elections, they had promised they had a formula for curbing price rise. Now is the time they should apply. The SP government will assist them in any way they can.""Alleging that the Centre had no concrete policy to assist farmers or to increase productivity, Akhilesh said, ""In UP, we have worked on strengthening infrastructure of our markets and increase production of potatoes and milk. We will devise ways to increase the production of pulses as well.""Attacking the right-wing's focus on cow protection, CM said the UP government was at the forefront of making effort to boost the animal husbandry sector. ""We have increased the number of cows and buffaloes. But when we talk of cows, there are those who will steer the conversation in another direction,"" Akhilesh said.The CM also made an indirect attack on the increasing number of communal incidents and how they impacted development of the country. Referring to the recent ink attacks at the hands of right-wing persons, Akhilesh said these sent out a negative image of the country and discouraged investors. ""What atmosphere you are creating?"" the CM said.He added, ""There is no debate on increasing investment or addressing unemployment. Prices have risen and it is difficult to control them. Poverty has increased. Debate should be constructive and the government should target reducing people's difficulties.""Akhilesh also said The SP government believed in encouraging sport and indigenous talent. Making an oblique reference to Shiv Sena activists protesting talks over the Indo-Pak cricket series, the CM said, ""Sporting events like these increase friendly ties between countries. They should not be politicised."""

Union food processing industries minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Jharkhand chief minister Raghubar Das will launch the food park set up at a cost of Rs 114 crore whose foundation stone had been laid way back in 2009 by then Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay. Though the 56-acre park can accommodate as many as 30 units, the first six companies will be Kitchenmate (puree, paste), Eastern Manufacturing & Exports (frozen potato patties), Raha Enterprises (frozen snacks), Vijay Cashew Processing (cashew nut processing) and Mishti Foods & Engineering (tomato powder and vegetable dehydration) and Jharkhand Green Peas (green peas processing). Their cumulative investment would be around Rs 25 crores. ""Prospective investors have already been allotted spaces. We aim to do a tripartite agreement and registration with them soon,"" Alireza Thaver, whole-time director of JMFPPL, told The Telegraph. ""The tripartite agreement will be among the JMFPPL, Riada (Ranchi Industrial Area Development Authority) and investors."" Riada, which functions under state industries department, had leased out land for the food park to promoters GenX Venture Capital Limited, Empower India Limited, Lunar General Trading, Micky Shipping Company, Greencoast Nurseries Private Limited. They, in turn, would sub-lease the same to investors. JMFPPL project manager Rakesh Sahay said they had already built a dedicated 33/11KVA power substation for the food park and would hand it over to state power utility Jharkhand Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (JUVNL) for daily running and maintenance. ""Our construction work is complete. We will hand over the facility to JUVNL soon,"" he said. A senior representative of Jharkhand Mega Food Park Private Limited (JMFPPL), who declined to come on record, said the launch could have been held right after state Foundation Day, but was postponed for a month due to last-minute finishing touches. ""Though we received a letter from the Union ministry that minister (Badal) would be able to inaugurate the food park on November 16, we asked for a month's time as there are certain issues,"" he said. However, JMFPPL executives are upbeat that the food park would become one of eastern India's preferred destinations for processing industries. Sources have said big names such as Gujarat-based Vadilal Industries Limited, which is known for its ice creams, have evinced interest in the Getalsud facility."

There is a need to lay bare the whole process, questioned additional chief secretary Suresh Kumar, who heads the Punjab agriculture department.Responding to this, Pepsico India executive director Vivek Bharti said a lot of efforts and input cost go into food processing. We are not operating on 500 per cent margins but on a thin margin of 5 per cent, he claimed.Instead of implementing the Contract Farming Act, Pepsoico believes in a long-term relationship with farmers, Bharti said.Suresh Kumar urged the food processing industry to suggest amendments in the act said it must follow the procedures of the act per se.Rs 8,000 crore committedAfter deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal announced zero tax on new food processing units in Punjab, as many as 55 investors from across the country and abroad committed Rs 8,000 crore investment by signing memorandums of understanding (MoUs) in the presence of Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal.The Union minister said Punjab, popularly known as the food bowl of India, contributes more than 40% of central pool of wheat, 26% of the central procurement of rice, 75% production of kinnows and oranges, and 7.5% of total milk production.Despite overall slump in the market, the agro industry is growing at 8.5% and the growth rate would go up further, she said.Punjab agriculture minister Tota Singh, agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu, Cargill Siraj chairman A Chaudhary, Akshay Bector of Bector Food and Nestle India senior vice-president Sanjay Khajooria were present on the occasion.India suffered Rs 92,000 cr food wastageAccording to a study conducted by the Union food processing ministry, food waste in the country stood at a whopping Rs 92,000 crore in 2014-15.To save the country from this loss we need to develop food processing industry as smaller countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia where more than 80% of total food grown is processed while it is only 10% in India, she informed."
270,A greener way out of farm crisis,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/A-greener-way-out-of-farm-crisis/articleshow/49615227.cms,2015-11-01,The Times Of India,"BATHINDA: On the face of it, farmers Sanjay Siyag and Balli Singh have little in common. Siyag is suave, speaks English and owns a few hundred acres of land.Three pit bulls and a Pakistani bully dog guard his sprawling house in Chautala village of Haryana's Sirsa district. Balli is the stereotypical doughty Sikh farmer, earthy and practical. When his lands got tangled in a family dispute, Singh started managing a 7.5-acre orchard on profit-sharing basis at Lilanwali village, just across the state border in Rajasthan.But what the two farmers share is a success story  a tale that could lead agriculture out of the expensive chemical fertiliser-pesticide dependence most cultivators here are trapped in.Balli's kinnow trees were dying, afflicted by huanglongbing and phytophthora, diseases that have wreaked havoc on citrus cultivations across the world. After conventional pesticides failed, he took a gamble with bio-fertilisers.He hasn't regretted that decision. ""Within six months, progress of the disease was halted. The trees started recovering,"" he says. So did his investments. While the first year fetched a return of just Rs 60,000, the second year's yield got him five times that amount. Continued use of bio-formulations kept increasing yields. Last year, the farmer claims to have earned Rs 10 lakh from the orchard.Siyag relates a similar experience. ""Around 600 kinnow trees in my orchard were dying. I tried a bio-formulation on a few plants. The results were beyond expectations. I was able to save 450 trees, which are now healthy and bearing better fruits than ever before.""Singh and Siyag are part of a growing tribe of converts to bio-fertilisers  products containing micro-organisms which increase the ability of the plant to extract nutrients, stimulate growth and help the plant fight diseases by natural processes. These microbes also restore the soil's natural nutrient cycle and build soil organic matter.Travelling through Faridkot and Bathinda districts in Punjab and Sirsa in Haryana, TOI met several farmers who related their happy experience with bio-fertilisers on various crops, from wheat and paddy to chillies and potatoes.Their costs had come down and their yields had increased.Experts endorse many of the benefits. ""Bio-formulations are very effective in plant growth promotion...They help in root elongation and root biomass increase which in turn improves the nutrient uptake of the plant,"" says K Annapurna, head of the microbiology division at Indian Agricultural Research Institute. The microbes also inhibit the pathogen population. ""Hence disease incidence is lowered and the plant remains healthy. Bio-fertilisers also strengthen the plant defences so that it can withstand pathogen attacks,"" she adds.Punjab and Haryana, India's shining agricultural success stories, are plagued by problems due to high chemical usage. Fertilizer use is highest in Punjab (250kg per hectare) and Haryana (207kg), compared to the national average of 128kg/ha. Pesticide use also is among the highest in the two states. This, coupled with water availability problems, has led to stagnating yields in major crops, raising worries for the future.""Most bio-fertilisers contain concentrated amounts of naturally occurring micro-organisms. These speed up nature's growth and regenerative processes,"" says Uday Philar, CEO of Sequoia Biosciences, a Pune-based bio-fertiliser company.The paddy crop of Jasbir Singh near Jhoke Sarkari village in Faridkot was visibly taller, greener and healthier than adjacent fields. He told TOI that bio-fertilisers helped his wheat crop withstand the havoc caused by unseasonal rainstorms in March-April this year because the roots of his crops were ""deeper and the stalks stronger"". With the just-harvested paddy too, Jasbir claims to have substantially increased his yields, getting up to 7.5 tonnes per hectare, much higher than the state's average of 4 tonnes.Farmers using bio-fertilisers on other crops too have claimed better quality and quantity. Ruby Singh Sandhu, a big potato farmer in Mallekan village near Haryana's Ellenabad town, reported a yield of up to 25 tonnes per acre, almost double the average output in the region.D L N Rao of the Indian Institute of Soil Sciences has been researching bio-fertilisers for over two decades and says their use undoubtedly leads to healthier plants and better yields. ""At least 25% of chemical fertilisers used in India could be replaced with bio-fertilisers. Not only would this save a lot of money for the farmers, it would also rescue the soil from poisoning and regenerate its vitality,"" he says.The real promise of bio-fertilisers probably lies in the big picture. In the region, south Punjab and north Haryana, where intensive chemical farming is not only ravaging the soil but also people's health, a shift towards more natural cultivation would bring much-needed healing.As Sanjay Siyag puts it, ""Moving towards green products is no longer a matter of choice for us. We are running out of other options."""
271,Farmers switch to social media to cope with distress,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Farmers-switch-to-social-media-to-cope-with-distress/articleshow/49622471.cms,2015-11-02,The Times Of India,"NAGPUR: With rains playing truant and the government failing to address agriculture issues, the distressed farming community in Vidarbha has switched over to the social media to help each other in stopping the spurt in suicides. Starting with Facebook and later WhatsApp, they are not only exchanging information but also taking lessons and motivating each other against ending their lives due to crop failure and mounting debts.Various groups like 'Bali Raja', 'Hoy Amhi Shetkari', Bhumiputra Sangharsh Vahini (BSV), Apulki, Bhumiputra Pimpri and others have been operating on social media for a year now. All these groups have 14-15 subgroups on WhatsApp and comprise farmers from entire Maharashtra and from neighbouring states as well.Vilas Tathod, a young farmer from Amravati, said, ""We recently delivered sewing machines to widows of 20 farmers in Buldhana. We had shared their plight on our various groups. A Pune-based NGO, Shivprabha Charitable Trust, came forward to sponsor the machines. Its chairman, who works in Dubai, came to know about the plight of these farm widows through social media.""Tahod cites another instance where a superintendent from Wardha agreed to sponsor education of four girls whose father had committed suicide due to crop failure.The members of these groups also exchange information about new techniques of irrigation, crop pattern, pesticide use, new cultivation methods, preventing crop diseases, increasing yield and also taking care of domestic animals. Interestingly, the groups also have scientists, experts and consultants related to agriculture who keep on guiding them. Those related to veterinary field, like from MAFSU, too guide the farmers on diseases related to animals.Younis Khan, an Akola-based agriculture consultant, said, ""We give them information on crop pattern, distance needed between two plants and how to increase yield. We also provide them ideas related to sowing and harvesting. In many cases, they send pictures on mobile and we instantly suggest them solution.""The members also get guidance on how to sell their products in markets where there is demand. ""We discuss rates of commodities such as onions and potatoes with friends from all over the state. If in Akola, the rates are Rs30 a kg and in Pune it's Rs60 a kg, we sell our produce in the market that will fetch us a good price,"" said Vinayak Sangle, a farmer from Sindkhed Raja.Educated members guide the less qualified ones in seeking loans from banks and completing formalities. If a suicide takes place in a village, those staying in nearby areas visit the family and support them mentally and financially. Members like Sanjay Kumthekar, who works in a five-star hotel in Mumbai, advises farmers on which vegetables are in demand.""The social media is like a blessing in an era where farmers are facing worst crisis due to global warming and government's neglect. We try to explain to farmers that mounting debts is not a crime as nature is not in our hands. Why to end our precious lives. We also try to discuss positive ideas and new techniques so that nobody could depend on nature,"" said Shivkumar Chandak, a farmer from Shegaon.The members think that it's just the beginning of a revolution which will go a long way in stopping suicides due to distress."

Sources said the government doesn't want to add fuel to the fire by cracking down on the farmers violating the rule now.It is not just those driving past paddy fields in the countryside who run into clouds of smoke these days, the menace of stubble burning is engulfing urban areas across Punjab in the evening hours with a thick cover of smog. Despite growing concerns last season over farmers resorting to burning of paddy straw that not just leads to pollution but also affects health of their own soil, the practice is continuing even as the state agencies prefer to be mute spectators.While the state agriculture department is content with giving subsidies on equipment to effectively clear paddy straw, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has gone slow in taking punitive action against the violators. If 53 farmers were identified and booked in 2013 (under Section 144 of CrPC), the number dipped to mere 16 in 2014 and no farmer has been penalized by the board so far this year.Sources said given the way farmers in the state had been up in arms over a series of issue pertaining to paddy procurement, potato prices and sugarcane collection in the recent months, there had been no full-throttle enforcement of the existing laws to check violators among paddy growers.When contacted, Punjab director of agriculture Gurdial Singh said the focus has been on popularizing equipment such as 'happy seeders' for sowing wheat in the fields after harvest of paddy. Besides, straw balers were being promoted to bind the straw and supply it to small bio-mass power plants and for co-generation of power by the sugar mills. However, despite subsidy to the tune of 50%, the high cost of the happy seeder at Rs 1.15 lakh remains a major hurdle for widespread use.Meanwhile, Babu Ram, member secretary, PPCB, admitted that no farmer had been booked for stubble burning this year so far.

The state government has entrusted the task of encouraging farmers to take to cultivating these medicinal herbs to UCOST. The herbs command a high price in the market. The state hopes that farmers with such crops will no longer need to move away from their villages. Rampant migration from border villages has left vast tracts of border lands open to encroachment by China.Renowned Ayurveda practitioner Vaidya Balendu has aided the effort by tracking herbs that could be grown in these areas. The plantation is expected to bring in Rs 12 crore in its first year.Rajender Dobhal, director-general of UCOST, told TOI, ""We have selected four species to begin with -- Kuth, Jadwar, Atees and Chairayta. These are premium species that command good prices. All these are herbs with multiple benefits, but Kooth is best known as a cure for liver ailments. Jadwar is used in the Ayurvedic treatment of blood cancer. Atees cures stomach diseases. Chairayta is used to treat high fever and dengue.""He said land had been identified for the growth of thousands of medicinal plants. ""These are rhizome species that take root at the time of snow deposition. By the time the snow melts by the end of March, the sapling will sprout. These saplings can then be distributed among farmers who will be trained to cultivate these. By end-August or early September, they will be ready for harvest. Buyers from Delhi have already made bookings for the produce. Farmers are bound to get good returns.""So far, farmers here have been growing potato and cholai (amaranth), perhaps unaware that the soil and conditions are suitable for the medicinal herbs.Sources said a ""crisis of security"" had occurred in the border areas with the large scale of the migration. It was necessary to ensure that the villages remain inhabited, sources said.Dobhal said a similar project would be carried out in Munsiyari, also close to the China border, at an elevation of over 2500 metres above sea level."

If you are taking the Parama flyover post midnight, you might just be taking the city's newest free-for-all party destination at night.Local traffic cops say that the recently-opened Parama Island flyover has already witnessed four accidents in the past one month since its inauguration.The figures say it all. A proactive traffic police have already booked around 750 bikers and seized their two-wheelers in the city in the past two weeks. More than 200 bikers have been pulled up in the last two days. In certain traffic guards, the south traffic guard (87 cases) for example, the number of bike seizures carried out on both the Kali Puja and Diwali nights is quite high. The number of cases for drunk driving, too, stand between five and fifteen.Police said that during their routine patrolling, they often find that parts of the Parama flyover are dotted with empty liquor bottles, potato chips packets and crushed water bottles. Cops admit that apart from being a high-speed zone for youngsters, the flyover has turned into a ""regular party-zone"" for them. ""We withdraw our men at night and the youths take over the flyover post midnight. With no CCTV in this huge stretch, it is difficult to find out what certain bikers are up to once they take the flyover,"" said a source.When this TOI correspondent visited the flyover on Thursday morning, he found empty liquor bottles in at least three different locations  one near the AJC Bose Road flyover link and another two at the railway bridge section of the flyover.Interestingly, the cops under whose jurisdiction this flyover falls, say they cannot improve things dramatically. ""We will need technical help and constant patrolling to change the scenario,"" said a local cop. Top officials at Lalbazar, though, appeared confident to reverse the tide. ""We cannot check cars on the flyover. But we have officers in adjoining areas who carry out intensified raids,"" said DC (traffic) Solomon V Neshakumar. The Park Circus traffic guard, on the other hand, said it has made only three bike seizures on the nights of Kali Puja and Diwali. Worse, local cops claimed that no bottles are thrown from the flyover towards the EM Bypass connector despite photographic evidence of the same.Lalbazar officials said they are worried about the rising number of accidents on flyovers. ""It's not possible for us to be present on the flyovers all the time. And, speed breakers will defeat the very purpose of the flyover. But we have been successful in controlling accidents in the past two weeks,"" a source said.In all, 23 persons were killed in about 40 accidents on flyovers this year, out of the total 350 accidents recorded in the city so far. ""For now, though, tender for painting of crash barriers to make them visible at night have been issued,"" said a top IPS officer.Police said they are planning to install CCTVs at certain stretches of Parama flyover. Another safety parameter in consideration is installation of 'advanced railing system' instead of the standard retaining wall. This has two horizontal metal cables that function as a crash barrier. They have 'rollers', rings made of a plastic-rubber composite that can absorb shock. On impact, it deflects a vehicle. The wire mechanism stretches to dampen the force of the impact. But sources said it would cost close to Rs 19 lakh for a 100-metre stretch."

As this festival is closely associated with offerings of vegetables and fruits, skyrocketing prices of these commodities have dampened the spirit of devotees. The price pinch has not left even edibles like fruits, vegetables, sugarcane juice and `duara' (traditional wooden baskets) used by devotees to make offerings to the sun god. The two-day Chhath festival will begin November 17.The price rise is forcing people to cut down the offerings. According to fruit and vegetable vendors, fruit prices have gone up by almost 15 per cent to 20 per cent while vegetables have become even more dearer. Though vegetable and fruit prices were high during Diwali and Annakoot but these commodities have become more costlier at the time of the Chhath festival.At present, bananas, which are the most sacred offerings, are being sold at about Rs 30 to Rs 40 a dozen while prices of other fruits like pomegranates, apples and `singhara' have also gone up. Rakesh, a fruit seller at fruit mandi at Phoolbagh said, ""Prices are bound to increase as it's a festive season. Bananas, which earlier were available for Rs 25 to Rs 30 a dozen are now being sold in the range of Rs 35 to Rs 40 a dozen. Similarly, the price of apples has gone up from Rs 60 per kg to Rs 75 and Rs 100 per kg while pomegranates, which were available at Rs 160 per kg, are being sold at Rs 180 per kg"".Prices of vegetables have also gone at various vegetable markets in the city. Potatoes are being sold at Rs 20 per kg while tomato has touched the mark of Rs 80 per kg. Even common vegetables like pumpkin, bottle-gourd (lauki) and other green leafy vegetables have become dearer due to Chhath festival.The inflation has not only affected prices of fruits and vegetables but even jaggery (gur) and `duaras' (wooden baskets used for performing the puja have become costlier in comparison to their prices during the last year. The price of jaggery has gone up from Rs 35-Rs 40 per kg to Rs 45-Rs 50 per kg while `duaras' , which are sold at Rs 100 per piece normally, are now available at Rs 200 to Rs 260 per piece.It may be mentioned that jaggery (gur) is an essential component of the Chhath puja as devotees prepare all sweet dishes like `thekau' and `rasiour' with it.This price rise has forced the devotees to cut down their Chhath offerings. ""Instead of two `duaras', we will buy only one this time and fill it up with fewer offerings. Fruits have become very expensive and the price of milk has also gone up. On the day of 'kharna', women prepare 'kheer' and 'roti' and everyone is invited to the house to have the `prasad'. But this year, we will have to cut down on the number of invitees,"" said Vineet Rai, whose was buying puja items along with his wife in a city market."
277,Reds are coming to oust potatoes,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Reds-are-coming-to-oust-potatoes/articleshow/49787529.cms,2015-11-15,The Times Of India,"Banaskantha district brings to mind potatoes - lots of them - thanks to Deesa, the unofficial potato capital of Gujarat. Farmers of the district started producing potatoes in large quantities about a decade back, thanks to McDonald's demand for `factory grade' variety of the tuber.But pomegranates are fast catching up and business in the fruit is believed to have crossed the Rs 100-crore mark. Banaskantha pomegranates are in demand everywhere in India and also exported to Bangladesh, Dubai, Malaysia and Sri Lanka.Commercial farming of pomegranates had started earlier but experts credit 51-year-old Zinabhai Patel for making it a big success. He started cultivating pomegranates a decade ago in Sarkari Goliya village.Zinabhai said he had heard Maharashtra had a good crop of pomegranates and that farmers there had made a lot of money.""Hence, I replaced traditional crops such as potatoes and castor with pomegranates,"" Zinabhai said. ""I attracted a lot of criticism from my own family members. In fact, my brothers who had planted saplings destroyed their crop.""But Zinabhai did not lose hope. In 2009-10, his faith and hard work fi nally paid off when he sold his crop or a record Rs 1.6 crore.Today he has 11 hectares of land n which he has sown 11,000 saplings.One hectare's yield gets around Rs 25 akh to Rs 30 lakh, he said.His success encouraged more than 250 farmers in places such as Dhanera, Deesa, Deodar, Tharad and Vavo grow pomegranates. Zinabhai's own village has more than 70% of its farmers growing the fruit. In December and May, traders from Delhi, Jaipur, Nagpur and Kolkata camp in Banaskantha to strike a deal for the fruit. Ramjibhai Bhatol, a farmer from a village near Palanpur, said the Sinduri or Bhagwa is the most cultivated variety because of its rich fruit and sweeter juice.""The basic difference between Gujarat and Maharashtra in pomegranate farming is that Gujarat produces fruits mainly for eating while Maharashtra produces more varieties which are also used for wine-making and food processing,"" said Bhatol.He further said that around 70% of the crop in his 22 bighas of land is exported. ""Hence, we have to maintain a high quality,"" he said.Potato prices being erratic, farmers in the past had to feed the tuber to animals or destroy entire crops. Pomegranates, on the other hand, are in high demand due to their use as fruit juice and for their medicinal properties.""Farmers are investing heavily in technology such as drip irrigation and crop quality monitoring,"" an official of the state agriculture department said. ""Some have been to Israel to learn new technology. Today the average plantation is 1,000 trees per person."""

Last week's heavy rain that submerged many parts of the city is now setting vegetable prices on fire.Tomatoes, which were being sold at the Triplicane marked for Rs40- Rs50 a kilo a couple of days ago was priced at Rs80 on Saturday. At the Koyambedu market, the wholesale price of tomato doubled to Rs60. Traders attributed it to decreased supply from southern districts and other states owing to rain. The wet weather also makes the greens perish faster than usual.Prices of okra (lady's finger), brinjal and carrot were also up by more than 50%. Okra was selling at Rs80 a kg, while brinjal and carrot were going at Rs60. The price of onion, if it is some solace, rose only by Rs10 a kg, now at Rs60. Drumstick, a crucial ingredient in the inevitable Chennai sambar, is selling at Rs150 per kg in the Triplicane market.""My vegetable bill for this week will go up by at least Rs300,"" estimated housewife Lalitha K, who buys her veggies at the Mylapore market.Traders said this was due to lower supplies from neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, as well as difficulties in transportation from southern districts like Theni, Dindigul and Madurai. So, will it get better in the coming days? Traders warn it may get worse. ""The prices are likely to increase by Rs5 next week, as heavier rain has been forecast,"" said K Govindan, a vegetable trader at Mandaiveli market. Prices of potatoes and onions, however, will not rise by more than Rs5 to Rs10, he added.""Normally 300 trucks of vegetables land in the market. But today, the supply was only 100 loads, and that too got sold out very fast, as it didn't rain today,"" said V R Soundarajan, advisor to the Koyambedu Vegetable Market Association. Some retail traders in the city's markets were jacking up prices citing increased transportation and labour charges due to the rain, he added.This was just a day after they were selling vegetables at a throwaway price to the few customers who trickled into the market braving the rain. Mounds of unsold tomatoes could be seen rotting on the lanes of Koyambedu market. Chandran, a vegetable wholesale trader in Koyambedu, pegged the wastage in the past two days at four tonnes.Vegetable prices would drop only if there is no or little rainfall in the next four days, Soundarajan said."

My entire stock has been sold,"" said Anwar Hassan a shop keeper in CIT Colony .Supply of milk and newspapers to most parts of the city was also affected as hawkers and milk delivery boys struggled to enter low-lying areas.Meanwhile, the Koyambedu vegetable market was a mess with garbage lying uncleared since November 8. "" Apart from the losses caused by the rain we have to put up with the menace of garbage not being cleared.People are scared to come to the market because of water-logging and overflowing garbage,"" said M Nagaraj, a trader."

The probabilty of the present system (low pressure area) turning into a depression is low. The low presure area is likely to dissipate in a day or two,"" Director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Regional Meteorological Centre, S R Ramanan told PTI.The well marked low pressure area now lies over West Central and adjoining south west bay off South Coastal Andhra Pradesh and North Tamil Nadu coast, he said.As a result, scattered, mild showers may be expected in Tamil Nadu, including Chennai and south Coastal Andhra Pradesh regions like Nellore would get more rains, he said.In Kancheepuram district, the Army and Air Force were deployed to rescue stranded citizens as torrential rains left residents marooned, as rain water inundated a large part of suburban Tambaram locality here.The Navy and Coast Guard have also joined rescue operations.Coast Guard choppers airdropped 500 kg of bread, biscuits and drinking water in Tambaram in two sorties, a CG release said and added their helicopters have been kept on standby to augment state government's relief efforts.The Navy said it had already sent in a well equipped team, comprising of divers, swimmers, inflatable crafts on Monday which had been positioned at Tambaram and that more boats and personnel have been sent to Tambaram, Kotturpuram and Manali.A naval helicopter from INS Rajali at neighbouring Arakkonam was also on standby, the navy said, adding it was also ready with its 'assets' here and at Vishakapatnam to assist the state government as and when required.Meanwhile, Southern Railway today announced cancellation of 15 trains bound for various destinations due to the water logging on tracks.Fifteen trains, scheduled to leave from Chennai and Puducherry and passing through Chennai Central today and tomorrow have been cancelled, SR said in release.In Chennai, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced Rs four lakh relief to the next of kin of the eight killed while opposition DMK pledged Rs one crore for relief and demanded all-party panels to monitor it.Yesterday Jayalalithaa had announced allocation of Rs 500 crore towards relief and rehabilitation.Jayalalithaa also announced setting up of 50 more farm fresh outlets on a temporary basis in Chennai to tackle rising prices of vegetables due to reduced arrivals of fresh stocks as a result of rains. Already, 42 state-run farm fresh outlets are selling veggies here.The new outlets would sell veggies like onions, potato and tomato, which are largely used by the people, an official release said.Meanwhile, the DMK, which had expressed solidarity with the state government's relief and rehabilitation efforts, announced that Rs one crore would be given for disaster relief.DMK chief Karunanidhi in a release said the amount was being given to the government towards disaster relief on behalf of his party.""The announcement of Rs 500 crore towards relief and rehabilitation is very less considering the scale of damages,"" he said, referring to Jayalalithaa's announcement.He said efforts should be made to get Central government's disaster relief fund on a large scale and wanted the government to try ""to solicit funds from the rich in Tamil Nadu for disaster relief"".The DMK chief also urged setting up of ""all-party committees in all the districts to extend adequate relief to the general public."" Relief distribution should be made in the presence of such committees, he said.Echoing the DMK demand, CPI State Secretary R Mutharasan suggested setting up up all-party monitoring committees to ensure speedy disbursal of relief to those affected ""without any discrimination."" He also urged the state to make efforts to get Central funds towards relief measures.PMK chief Ramadoss demanded ""Rs 5,000 as financial aid to each of the families that had lost job opportunities and livelihood resources due to the rains and flood."

Since Monday , prices of vegetables like tomatoes, onions and potatoes saw an increase of around 30% to 40%. The rates are expected to rise by another 15 % to 20 % in the coming days as the number of trucks bringing in vegetables to Koyambedu vegetable market has come down to 125 per day from the normal 250 per day.Incessant rain over the past one week in the state forced many lorry owners to suspend operation of vehicles. This trend began last Thursday and continued till Tuesday, market source said.Koyambedu market wholesale traders' association president V R Soundararajan said since the MeT department had forecast severe rain, the number of trucks and traders coming to buy vegetables from the market had come down over the past few days.On Wednesday, after there was a break from the rain, retail traders and the public rushed to the market to buy vegetables, he said."

Cabbages and potatoes were among low-priced vegetables, which sold at Rs.30 and Rs.25 a kg, respectively.While customers began to trickle in at the Koyambedu wholesale market on Tuesday, they were disappointed that the vegetables were either priced high or were not of good quality. Traders noted that the market received only half of the usual supply.S. Chandran, president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association, said the market received a major share of produce from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, apart from Tamil Nadu. But, several truckloads could not be transported owing to shortage of labour and vehicles.Retailers complained of shortage of quality produce. V. Palani, a retail trader in Perambur, said: I had to buy a box of tomatoes for Rs.1,000 and had to dump a sizeable portion because of poor quality.Consumers did not have much choice as most vegetables were expensive. Instead of stocking vegetables, customers like Merlin Samuel of Anna Nagar are buying vegetables in smaller portions.We are unable to get eggs too in many shops, she said.Every day, Chennai consumes 55-65 lakh of eggs. However, as production has reduced by 15 per cent owing to chilly weather, there is a shortage of eggs in the city. Officials of the National Egg Coordination Committee said much of the eggs produced were also being transported to north India.A retailer in Anna Nagar said that due to the rain, there had been a shortage in supply.The unrelenting rain has also had an impacted on the cost of pulses that continues to be out of reach for consumers. S. Meenakshi of Mogappair said she had stocked up on dal because of the rain.We are vegetarians and the only proteins we consume come from pulses. I hope the price of dal will come down, she said.Traders noted that the cost of dal had dipped marginally after Deepavali. However, as consumers stock essential commodities following rain, the demand has increased and that eventually led to a hike in prices.A retailer in Thoraipakkam said prices had been fluctuating for the past three weeks. Prices had come down after Deepavali as a lot of hoarded stock has been released into the markets. Some brands have stuck new price tags on old packets, he added."

Did I want to earn the sobriquet of being current because I was responding to the signs of the times? Thank you, no! I quite like my small basket, dearies!I treasure the memory of Saturday mornings at the local market, when my father would show me how to pick carrots that didnt have a green ring around their tops, ladies fingers with tender tips and green beans that you snapped off, drumsticks that you twisted at both ends and fish that you gingerly pressed to judge their freshness. What a bounty of knowledge and experience!I loved to listen to customers vying for the grocers attention or bargaining for a rupees discount or demanding some extras like some chillies thrown in for good measure. Though the wonderful skill of real time negotiation may have diminished with the advent of fixed prices, the local grocer, butcher and fishmonger still remain a significant part of our lives and the skills an inherent part of our market knowledge. These relationships that traversed the line from business to pleasure go beyond price wars, competition and inflation.More than anything, I love the smell of fresh produce  what can be more refreshing and liberating than feeling resi-dual earth on potatoes and ginger or fr-esh green leaves on carrots, radishes and beetroots or the weight of a snowy white cauliflower. I love the design and symmetry as the grocer arranges natures bounty in colourful piles of purple, orange, pink, red, brown and green. I love the chatter of bargaining and local gossip and the hum of old family businesses.I love the surprise of discovering which fruit or vegetable is in season and wondering what the next season will bring. I love drawing up plain and exotic menus to get the best out of seasonal produce and gormandise on them. I love shopping with my children as I pass on wisdom gleaned from my own experiences. I love repeating the Saturday ritual with my husband as we make time to share the exhilaration of great bargains and steals!It takes body, mind and spirit to get up and smell the air, to walk down a familiar road, to rekindle the magic of marketing for the best produce at the right price for your family if not for yourself. I am not against convenience stores or taking short cuts. Ive taken them myself on a busy day but should I be laughed at and shamed into grabbing the easier way out. Shame it seems is a new marketing strategy  a desperate attempt at making an offering that relies on the psychology of humiliation.And to whosoever is concerned  nothings changed since I and every kindred spirit was laughed at. Im happy to carry my small basket to the end of the road wondering what surprises lie in store for me. As for inconveniences, well, they are just opportunities waiting to be explored. And if thats not good market sense, then weve lost wisdom to a button."

Tomato is usually raised in about 20,000 acres in Dharmapuri and another 15,000 acres in Krishnagiri district.About 5,000 grades, each grade comprising 25 kgs, used to arrive at the Royakottai market every day.Now it has got reduced to 50 grades a day. In Palacode market, a 15 kg box of tomato is being sold at Rs. 750.With the commencement of Sabarimalai season, when the devotees are expected to eat only vegetarian food, there is going to be more demand for the vegetables, further leading to the rise in prices in the next few days.In Thammampatti town and its surrounding villages such as Sentharapatti, Gangavalli, and Koodamalai, the standing crops have been badly hit."

But the untimely rain damaged the crop and thereby leaving the farmers in distress.Narayanaswamy, a farmer from Kolar district, told Deccan Herald that he had sown one acre of potatoes in September and just when the crop was ready for harvest, incessant showers washed away the yield.Potato cultivation is taken up on a large-scale in Hosakote, Devanahalli, Kolar, Srinivasapura, Chikkaballapura and surrounding areas.Every day we get fifty trucks of potatoes from these places.

Making matters hard to digest, if the agricultural marketing website is to be believed the only vegetable that is well within the common man's reach seems to be raw bananas or plantains, which is apparently being sold around Rs 4 per piece in city's agrarian markets.""Almost every vegetable we used to buy is reaching Rs 100 per kilo, if this is how the price continues to shoot up. What do we eat?"" questioned D Chaitanya, a resident of Gaddiannaram.Many denizens said they had cut down on their regular intake of cauliflowers, tomatoes and potatoes due to the price hike. ""We don't know when the prices would come down, until then it seems we have to opt for less amount of vegetables,"" said Kalyan Sukumar, a resident of Banjara Hills.According to farmers, the rise in prices of pulses and vegetables stems from the state government's inability to establish storehouses in agrarian lands and procure stocks at the minimum support price (MSP).""If the stock is procured from the farmers at the MSP rates, this would weed out all the middlemen, who hoard the stocks till the prices rise. Irrespective of what the farmers grow, all of them have faced a severe crop loss this year.

It can easily curb the inflation rates. But that is not the case,"" he added.Similarly, agricultural experts say that the farmers must be provided with proper facilities for them to transport their harvests.""The limited quantities of stocks being sent to the farmers' market shows that there is rampant hoarding in play.

They also rued the unavailability of adequate certified seeds in the first place. They want the government to provide subsidized seeds and are not ready to pay what they feel is an ""exorbitant"" price for the certified seeds.Farmers of Kendrapada district reportedly had plans to raise potatoes on 500 hectares of riverside agricultural land, for which they need about 4,000 quintals seeds. But, the district horticultural department has received only 200 quintals of certified potato seeds until now from the Odisha Seed Corporation (OSC) to provide to the farmers, informed assistant director of horticulture, Kendrapada, Bishnu Charna Das.Besides, potato farmers are angry over the rising price of certified potato seeds. The official rate of certified seeds is Rs 2,550 per quintal while seeds are available in the open market at of Rs 1,000-1,500 per quintal. Forced into a corner, many farmers are now buying substandard seeds from the open market. Some farmers also stock their own seeds and don't need to buy any from the market.""The authorities have made life very difficult for farmers by fixing the price of certified potato seed at Rs 2,550 per quintal. It is high time they provide at least Rs 1,000 subsidy per quintal to the farmers to purchase seeds, said Gayadhar Dhal the secretary of district Krusaka Sabha.The government provides Rs 30,000 subsidy per acre to potato growers in order to encourage farmers to raise more potatoes. But, only farmers who purchase certified seeds from the government are entitled to the subsidy. Those who are buying seeds from outside will not get any subsidy from the government.""Instead of encouraging farmers to grow potatoes, the government is discouraging them by fixing the seed price at an exorbitant rate of Rs 2,500 per quintal,"" said Chaitanya Mallick a farmer of Kora village. Many seed merchants from Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal are minting money by selling substandard potato seeds as farmers are opting out of buying government certified seeds due to the high price, he added.The farmers of the district have been facing natural disasters each year in the forms of floods, cyclone and drought. A few months ago, the price of potatoes skyrocked in the state due to non-production of sufficient potatoes in the riverside areas of the state. Farmers also face problems due to non-availability of cold storage facilities in the district, said Bhagabat Swain a farmer of Pattamundai."

They described how bad Bihar had become under him and how the Yadavs went on a rampage. There was Jungle Raj; you could not go out at night; Patna city was unsafe; well-to-do business families had to close up shop and leave; and even professional doctors who were known for their empathy to the poor were made to sell out and leave Bihar. Beautiful family homes were sold for a song and many went bankrupt.The exodus from Bihar is still going on. Visit any big metro in India and the street vendors, the taxi and auto drivers, the domestic help and the labourers are all Biharis. Even in Kolkata where wages are low and development non-existent women and men from the villages of Bihar, are working as domestics or cab drivers.Nitish Kumar, when he became CM of Bihar, was like a breath of fresh air. And yet he made a deal with Lalu and the felons party won more votes than Nitishs party.I just could not understand why or how this happened?Even if the BJP made mistakes and some people spoke out of turn how can it compare to 15 years of total decadence and despair? When a chief minister of a state has actually been indicted by our judicial system and he gets out on bail and acts as if nothing has happened and goes onto to campaign for an election then I think there is something really wrong with our democracy. The fact that his nemesis makes a pact with him to get to power, questions the very moral fibre of our leadership.Then Lalu Yadav takes care of his family and appoints two of his quite immature sons ministerial berthsthis to in an impoverished state with a population of 100 million that needs competent administrators for infrastructure and health. Surely such behavior encourages sends a message to all would be politicians that no matter what you do; how badly you steal from a system or downgrade it; caste and dynasty in India plays a vital role and you can rise again. How can we even call ourselves a democracy?I just finished reading, The Emergency, by Coomi Kapoor and although I was in Delhi during this dark period, I really did not know the extent of the damage Indira Gandhi did to our freedoms or how Sanjay Gandhi, her son and heir, was allowed to take the law into his own handsthe judiciary, the news, the bureaucrats and the police were all compromised overnight!I realize now that it was Indira Gandhi and her progeny that started the whole movement of family dynasties ruling India, such as the Abdullahs in Kashmir; Karunanidhi in Tamil Nadu; the Lalu Yadav family in Bihar; Mulayam Singh Yadav and his many relatives in power in UP and the Badals in Punjab. In Kolkata, just now, I heard that Mamatas nephew was sending crores to banks abroad. But then this could be just rumours as voters today suspect all politicians, such is their history in our blighted country.The rot always starts from the top and then others think if they can do it and get away with it why not my progeny?This is the sad truth of India today and this is why I admire the BJP as it is not a family party and will never be.I was asked once why I objected to dynasties in politics when in business and in other professions sons succeed the father. My answer was that a business can fail and not affect millions but when political dynasties dont deliver a country can be brought to its knees and millions suffer. That is why in a democracy, it is imperative to have good hard working administrators as Chief Ministers or the Prime Minister.India cannot afford family planning and population control to be neglected just because Sanjay Gandhi made it a political hot potato that no other party would address ever again. Such mistakes cost a country dearly and generations suffer.The other problem with dynasty is that invariably the genes of the father or mother who had to work hard to prove himself/herself as a leader of a political party is diluted when it comes to their children. They get the post readymade and therefore think it is their birthright such as Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi and so many others in the political arena. When you get something for free you take it for granted. All you need is the right name and a fiefdom.India desperately needs a constitutional amendment that will only allow the child, or any relative of a politician to stand for a ticket if he/she has actually worked in the field and proven themselves as competent to administer to the needs of a constituency, be it through social work, education, dedication and achievement in a field that that makes them capable and experienced enough to deliver. There have been such people of worth such as the late Minister KC Pant.None of the political families I have mentioned in this article have worked for the best interests of their state. Most of them have lined their pockets and that of their ministers and worst of all, they have taught their progeny that this is how to run a state or a country.Thus we have India still stuck in the developing-country-category with 400 million poor people and no jobs. This is what decades of dynastic democracy has got us.Our brightest brains must search for genuine change to this problem and urge for positive constitutional amendments wherein we can proudly say that we really are a democratic nation and not one where the fiefdoms of Maharajas have today become the fiefdom of political parties.The vested interests against change are strong and it will need educating voters on their rights and what good governance really meansnot just sops but jobs, housing, fair-priced food, education, healthcare, a clean environment and the rule of law. Only then can we say we stand head and shoulders with the civilized nations of the world and are a true democracy."
291,Rajkot man packs big ideas into tiny machines,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Rajkot-man-packs-big-ideas-into-tiny-machines/articleshow/49928923.cms,2015-11-26,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: In 1982, Veljibhai Desai, a mechanical engineer in his 40s, summoned enough courage to leave his job and set up a venture to manufacture miniature industrial machines named Tiny Tech Plants.Rajkot-based Desai was driven by his dream of following in the footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi in empowering villages. His vision was clear - he would only provide machinery for rural areas that would be run by a single person costing minimal investment. For himself, he set a rule -he would never expand out side Rajkot, would never borrow money or go after profits and expansion. Today, 33 years later, Desai's brainchild is not only flourising in Gujarat as a successful model of decentralization but sells in 111 foreign shores -primarily African countries. It is included as a successful case of social entrepreneurship in IIM Indore and Ahmedabad.Desai, now 73, makes mini versions of oil mills, grinding mills, biogas plant, chaff cutter, potato banana wafer making machine, peanut butter extractor and solar cooker. He has invented specific machines such as palm oil extractor and a ma chine for extracting coconut kernel. All these machines run on half a horsepower to 10 horsepower (0.4 to 7.5 Kw) input. His tiny steam engines run on waste and biomass are lighting up tiny hamlets in India. He was content when his steam engine lit up 200 homes in Dalbhanga village in Naxal-hit Saraikela-Kharasawan in Jharkhand.""Key issues plaguing India including poverty , unemployment and exploitation are born of unchecked industrialization.Industries fuel urbanisation by breaking villages that are primary growth engine for the country,"" he says. Desai says he miniaturizes technology used in mega plants and makes it affordable and effective for rural setting. Lathe industry in Rajkot helps him design and manufacture customized parts.Desai's most successful experiment was with oil mills as it works on principal of scale.""Conventional mills require tons of seeds for effective operations while tiny mills can process 50 to 100 kg of seeds at a low investment. We realized scale was not just our problem when we started getting queries from African nations for oil mills and other machines,"" he says. International business helped Rajkot-based industrialist Veljibhai Desai to sustain his Tiny Tech Plants that manufactures miniature industrial machines.""The purchase process took months when our price quoted in dollars would go up. This became our profit and kept the enterprise running,"" says Desai. The firm has exported over 700 oil mills and other machines in two decades, mostly to African countries.Desai became subject of an award-winning case at Global Summit on Management Cases held at IIM Raipur in 2014 where it was presented by Professor Patturaja Selvaraj of IIM Indore and Malay Patel, academic associate at IIM Ahmedabad.This year, it has got inclusion in IIM-A as classic case of social entrepreneurship -the case predominately consists concept of Gandhian economics, frugal innovations and advantages of decentralization of economies. ""Desai puts humans at the centre of his business. Today we are living in the world where 50% of the wealth is accumulated by 1% of our global population creating disparity and exploitation. What interested me in the case was Desai's idea of tiny machines that can work in Indian context to make self reliant and independent entrepreneurs,"" he says. Providing context, Patel says that Mahatma Gandhi mentions machines in following words - ""I hate the passion for machines which work upon diminishing manpower. Some talk about machines which could spare manpower when thousands of people are thrown jobless on the streets. I want wealth to be accumulated not just in a few hands but for all the people in the world."""

The price of local variety of brinjal has shot up from Rs. 20 -30 to Rs. 100. Traders said that the vegetables were quickly perishing in the rain, leading to less supply and higher prices.The vegetables are not withstanding the rain for a day or two. Use of urea and pesticides are reducing the shelf life of the vegetables. Once the bags get wet, the supply is getting spoiled, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam. At least 50 per cent of vegetables being supplied to Vellore market is arriving in poor condition. If the vegetables do not get sold in a day or two, if the lorry arrives a day late, then the produce is not usable.For instance, he said at least 20 gunny bags of cabbage perished due to the rain. This is leading to huge losses for vendors. Tomatoes and brinjal are the worst hit, he added.With the supply getting damaged, the cost of vegetables will return to normal rates only after the rain stop and new yield arrives. Onions offer some solace to consumers with the prices dropping in the last one week. It is now sold for Rs. 20 to Rs. 30, while carrots cost Rs. 40. A kilo of beans could burn a hole in the purse as the rates had increased to Rs. 100, while ladys finger cost Rs. 80.Drumstick is priced at Rs. 120 a kilo, while cabbage costs Rs. 20 and potatoes Rs. 20. The cost of peas has soared to Rs. 150, while broad beans cost Rs. 80 from its earlier rate of Rs. 20-25 before the rain. Small onions cost Rs. 40, ginger Rs. 40 (new) and Rs. 50 (old) and green chillies cost Rs. 30, he added."

A few others have seen minor increases.At the Chala market, from where most retail vendors in the city source their vegetables from, tomato was being sold for Rs.60 a kg, up from Rs.30 a fortnight ago. At a wholesale and retail shop on K.K. Road, beans cost Rs.80 a kg, up from around Rs.50. Cucumber was priced at Rs.40, double what it around three weeks ago. Long beans cost around Rs.90.However, vegetables such as cabbage, yam, ginger, colocasia, pumpkins, ash gourd have not seen any price variation.Onion, which just a couple of months ago were bringing tears to housewives eyes, cost Rs.40 a kg.At a Horticorp outlet near Kunjalumoodu, brinjals were being sold for Rs.80 a kg, up from Rs.60 two-and-a-half weeks ago.

294,Persistent food  inflation worrying,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/515074/persistent-food-inflation-worrying.html,2015-12-01,Deccan Herald,"C S C Sekhar Dec 2, 2015, 23:54 ISTFood inflation (FI) has been quite stubborn and higher than over-all inflation in nine out of the last 10 years.The sharp rise in prices of pulses (arhar and urad) and onion in the last few months caused considerable hardship to many households. Although food inflation has come down since August 2014 and is presently quite low at 4 per cent based on consumer price index (CPI), the recurrent sharp spikes in prices of few commodities is a major concern to policymakers.Food inflation (FI) has been quite stubborn and higher than overall inflation in nine out of 10 years in the last decade. It has accelerated significantly after 2009 which was a severe drought year. Initially, this was attributed to the poor agricultural performance on account of drought and inappropriate trade policy. However, the problem persisted even after improvement in food production, tightening of foodgrain exports and liberalising of imports.The interesting feature is that no single commodity showed uniformly high inflation in all these years. Different commodities contributed to food inflation in different years. In 2014, it was potato and pulses that showed sharp rise in prices. In 2013, vegetable prices witnessed sharp increase and in 2012 it was cereals.This indicates that there may not be a major structural problem with any one single commodity. Commodity-specific strategies, with a judicious mix of supply and demand side policies, are needed to address food inflation. Aspects related to technology, price, procurement and trade need to be factored in. Different strategies are needed for storable and perishable commodities.For example, to address the recent price rise in pulses, the Government of India is considering several measures  new programmes to increase pulses production, hike in the minimum support price (MSP), and procurement by the government agencies and imports by government agencies.The existing National Food Security Mission on Pulses has yielded satisfactory results in raising production from 15 million tonnes in 2007-08 to about 19 mt by 2013-14. This increase is significant when we consider that the increase in 57 years, from 1950-51 to 2007-08, is only 7 mt! Therefore, it may be advisable to strengthen the existing programme rather than beginning a new programme.The option of using genetically modified varieties of pulses may be explored to boost production further. The MSP is effective only if backed by effective procurement. Therefore, effective procurement is a sine quo non for assured price support to farmers. Timely imports are necessary in case of domestic production shortfalls to augment supply. Futures markets may be developed further to help in providing the right signals for import decisions. However, streng-thening the supply side alone will not be able to tame food inflation. The case in point is that of rice. Production of rice is quite robust with overflowing stocks.There is effective MSP and more than 30 per cent of the cereal production is being procured by the Food Corporation of India in the last five years. India is also the top exporter in the world with about 30 per cent of the world rice exports in 2014. Yet, rice is one of the major commodities contributing to Indias food inflation in the last decade.This is mainly because of lopsided stock management policies. India has built up huge stocks but does not have a rational stock liquidation policy. Excessive procurement and stocking in the last few years have reduced market availability of rice, thus leading to a sharp rise in prices.Stock liquidationThe cereal inflation cooled after stock liquidation to the tune of 15 mt and this shows the adverse effect of excessive procurement and stockholding on the market prices. Therefore, it is important to dovetail production, price, procurement, stock-release and trade policies for storable commodities.The strategy for perishable products needs to be different. The seasonality and perishability of fruits and vegetables requires that usage of processed and frozen products needs to be promoted. A major portion of the processed fruits and vegetables market is almost totally export-oriented because of lack of adequate domestic demand.Onions account for about 93 per cent (in volume) of the total export of fresh vegetables from India. The other major items of export are potato, tomato, brinjal, beans, carrots, chillies, capsicum etc. These are precisely the items that result in frequent price spikes in Indian markets.It is reasonable to assume that some of the price volatility can be reduced if Indians are encouraged to consume processed and frozen vegetables. This may require cultural reorientation and awareness campaigns since Indians prefer fresh vegetables and fruits. Strict quality checks also need to be put in place.It is estimated that more than 20-23 per cent of the total production of fruits is lost due to spoilage at various post harvest stages. Processing will also help reduce this spoilage. Growth in the fruit and vegetables processing industry is constrained by infrastructural, processing and managerial shortcomings. These bottlenecks need to be addressed too.(The writer is Associate Professor, Institute of Economic Growth, University of Delhi)"
295,West Bengal takes Rs. 300 crore loan to meet paddy target,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/West-Bengal-takes-Rs-300-crore-loan-to-meet-paddy-target/articleshow/49990586.cms,2015-12-01,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government has tied up with its infrastructure finance arm West Bengal Industrial Development Finance Corporation (WBIDFC) for a Rs 300 crore bridge loan to touch the highest ever procurement target of paddy in the election year. The state government has set a target of procuring 30 lakh tonne of rice in the current financial year, the highest ever so far.The minimum support price for paddy this year is fixed at Rs 1,410 by the Centre. From the last year, West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation (WBECSC) was taking bridge loan from WBIDFC for seamless procurement of paddy .When contacted, WBIDFC chairman Abhirup Sarkar confirmed the development. ""Yes, our board has cleared Rs 300 crore credit to WBECSC. The state government had also set up a task force for procurement which has submitted report in September,"" he added.An official of WBECSC pointed out that the state government has adopted this strategy of taking bridge loan from last year so that procurement is not stuck owing to paucity of funds. Last year, the government took Rs 120 crore loan from WBIDFC, which was later paid back.The Centre gives grant to state for the procurement of paddy but the fund comes late. The government starts procuring paddy from October 1 under Kharif marketing season and it continues till March that includes Rabi season. ""Here paddy grows thrice in a season. We generally procure paddy in all season under this Kharif marketing season. Sometimes, we do procure wheat and potato but the quantity is not too much,"" an offi cial added. It is learnt that WBCSC will procure 15 lakh tonne of paddy , 50% of the target set by the state government for this fiscal.""As of now, highest procurement of rice by the state is 22.2 lakh tonne WBESC last year procured 10.66 lakh tonne which was more than our target of 8.7 lakh tonne last fiscal. In fact, the ac tual procurement of paddy is 30% more than the rice target because paddy:rice ratio is 100:70. For 30 lakh tonne of rice you need over 43 lakh tonne of paddy ,"" the official added.Food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mullick pointed out that storage is the main bottleneck for increasing procure ment. ""We have requested Food Corpora tion of India (FCI) to provide more stor age space to us. Currently , we have 5 lakh tonne capacity for paddy . We want to dou ble the capacity ,"" he said.Mullick pointed out that his depart ment is already working on the state ac tion plan for procurement for 2016-20 prepared by special task force."

Sources said that another two dozen mills are likely to get operational within a week.This comes at a time when the new SAP remains shrouded in mystery and previous arrears due towards farmers continue to hover around Rs 2500 crore. While officials in the state government remained tight-lipped, sources associated with the cane price determination exercise indicated that the state government would fix the SAP soon. ""A final decision would be taken by the state cabinet within the next 10 days,"" said a senior government functionary.Top sources in the state government said that the mill owners were recently approached by senior officials from the cane development department assuring them that their demands, mainly of seeking more subsidy, would be looked into if they fired up their boilers. Last year, when UP government fixed the SAP at Rs 280 per quintal, the millers managed to get a direct subsidy of Rs 40 per quintal. Of this, while Rs 28.75 was given in the form of cash subsidy, another Rs 11 per quintal came through as tax rebate.This time, sources said, the millers are demanding even a higher subsidy from the state government. A member of UP sugar mills association (UPSMA) told TOI that the millers have already projected a paying capacity of not more than Rs 225 per quintal.The cane issue has, of late, been turning into a political hot potato with almost all Opposition parties throwing in their hat in an attempt to gain a mileage in the run-up to the assembly elections due in 2017.Only last week Congress vice-president, Rahul Gandhi led a padyatra in Saharanpur to rake up the cause of distressed cane-growers in west UP. At the same time, Ajit Singh led-Rashtriya Lok Dal held a series of agitation against millers seeking a start to crushing season in time. The BJP brass in UP too has been keeping the political pot boiling over the cane issue by cornering not only the ruling SP government but also the Congress."

Though supply is better this year, sales are minimal due to the rain, say vegetable merchants.""This time, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have had good production of onions. In Karnataka, onion is produced in Hubbali and Dharwad where rainfall hasn't been abnormally high. Weather had little impact on production. But due to rain we are unable to set up stalls on wet grounds and sell our produces. Retail sellers are not taking the risk of buying onions in bulk as they could be damaged in a few days,"" said B Ravi Shankar, a wholesaler.This apart, supply to Tamil Nadu has been affected due to heavy rainfall and flood in the neighbouring state. Though there was good production of potatoes in Punjab and Karnataka, rains have affected sales, he added.However, price of tomatoes in the city has shot up as most produces have been left rotting due to continuous rain and overcast weather in the past few days. The demand for eggs has increased, though. ""Usually , consumption of eggs peaks during winter.

(Source: Express Photo by Subham Dutta)At the stroke of another midnight, 68 summers after August 1947, land and nationalities changed hands for the third time in a densely populated, sparsely developed part of India and Bangladesh.P Ulaganathan, the young 39-year-old district magistrate of Cooch Behar in West Bengal, knows the math and the map of the land swap. But more than geography, he wants to talk about history.Right now, we are sitting at the cusp of changing not just global geography, but also the way these people have looked at themselves, what they have perceived about their lives for decades, he says.

At the edge of the camp, in a playground with colourful swings, slides and climbing roaps, children are making the most of the watery winter sun.The temporary, numbered homes at the Dinhata camp, bearing 300-odd inmates, are just about comfortable in this mild weather.

(Source: Express Photo by Subham Dutta)Around 220 families from former Indian enclaves in Rangpur, Bangladesh, chose to move to India, and of them 201 are now living at the camps. None of those living in former Bangladeshi enclaves inside India has chosen to go to the other side.The new Indians from Bangladesh were told they could bring along whatever belongings they wished. So an odd motley of belongings lies spilled over outside the tin homes  beds, cupboards, books in suitcases, and even the odd duck.We will probably end up selling the furniture when we are a little more settled. This bed was my fathers and his fathers before that. But theres no space for it here, says Ram Chandra Das.Along the camps fenced boundary are toilets, cattle sheds, a dining hall, offices of government representatives, and an overhead water tank.Outside, a platoon of BSF and officers of the district police are constantly on patrol to ensure the safety of the migrants.Its an entirely new existence for the 980 inmates in the three camps, though separated from Rangpur by just 150 km. Like the residents of the former Bangladeshi enclaves in India, they lived all these years in areas that were demarcated only by weathered stone pillars and forgotten by governments on either side.Villages did not have basic public services such as electricity, healthcare facilities or roads, while parents often forged documents to ensure that their children could go to school. They couldnt vote, and not having identity documents spelled detention or imprisonment.A week after the first families moved into the Dinhata camp, the initial trepidation of being caged in by the wire fencing at their new address dissipated after the administration explained it was to ensure that outsiders didnt enter and that the migrants themselves were free to move about.Officials anticipated that problem. Not the one that followed.The menu for the food to be given to the camp inmates was decided by the Centre and state government in consultation  rice, daal and two vegetable curries. The problem is one of too many channels. We at Cooch Behar speak to the West Bengal government, before it in turn speaks to the Central government. Finally the MEA speaks to the Bangladesh government. So, for instance, when we spoke about the need for protein in diet, we suggested fish. But by the time the menu was approved, soyabean was finally decided, a senior official says.It was also decided that for around a month, self-help groups would feed the migrants. Thereafter, they would get rations. No one, it appears, accounted for fish.We need fish or at least some other source of protein apart from soyabeans. We are Bengalis and we have fish two to three times a day. Even if there is nothing else to eat at home, weve never gone a day without maacher jhol (fish curry). Here weve been eating vegetarian food for days, says Manmohan Burman (36). Its intolerable.On November 28, after a dinner of rice, watery daal, a potato curry with the odd smattering of beans, and the inevitable soyabean curry, a delegation of the migrants marched up to the district administrations office at the Dinhata camp and put in a written request for change of menu. Officials have now forwarded the request to the state government, seeking more fish.Most nights, however, the migrants admit, are joyous affairs.Weve never had electricity before. I dont think Ive ever stayed a night in a home with a fan. Its incredible, says Padman Burman, 28, at Mekhliganj camp. My children can actually study at night. This is allowing them more time to play and by the time they have had dinner, theyre almost asleep. Earlier, I would try and get them to bed by evening and it was impossible.Dusk falls quickly in Cooch Behar. Standing next to the tin walls of his house that are glittering from the light overhead, Padman breaks into a broad smile and adds, Others take such things for granted, but I still cant believe it.Mekhliganj camp: Families whove moved into the resettlement camps from erstwhile Indian enclaves in Bangladesh are being given incentives to form self help group to aid their future employment prospects.

After they have spent the day negotiating the paperwork that comes with acquiring new citizenship, the migrants line up at these offices every evening. They have many questions  about their current problems, their future prospects, and the laws that they are still trying to get the hang of.The government has held a series of seminars informing the migrants about their rights and duties, as well as the Indian Penal Code and the penalties associated.After moving into their new homes at the resettlment camp at Mekhliganj in Cooch Behar, after leaving the former Indian enclaves in Bangladesh, families began slowly readjusting to their new environment while holding onto familiar beliefs and habits.

(Source: Express Photo by Subham Dutta)But the one problem that surfaces repeatedly, says Ulaganathan, is of family members left behind. They were not counted when the initial list was prepared of people living in enclaves on either side, and now remain unaccounted for.Motia Rahman and his wife, Elema Bibi, thought they would finally be able to live together after 17 years of marriage. He lived in the Indian enclave of Dahala Khagrabari in Bangladesh, while Elema belonged to Cooch Behar. Now, after the swap, he is at the Dinhata camp, but she can only visit him and not live there. This is because her name was not included in the initial headcount that took place in Bangladesh in 2011 and served as the basis for the exchange of people after the Land Boundary Agreement was signed this year.Motia grieves similarly for his three sisters, left back in Bangladesh. The 2011 headcount took place over just three days and nobody was given prior information about it. As a result, many of us have had to leave our family members behind while others havent come to India because they couldnt. In my family of 16, only 13 names were included, says Motia.As a senior district administration says, the headcount of September 2011 (done on both sides) followed talks between former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina.The joint survey counted 38,521 residents in Indian enclaves inside Bangladesh and 14,863 in Bangladeshi enclaves in India.The official explains, However, with no plans to actually formalise the agreement at the time, the headcount was not done as effectively as it could have been. It just recorded names of individuals and their religion, leaving out crucial detail such as family size.We have been allotted one house, since the 12 of us were counted as one family. But it is in fact three families. We are three brothers and we are all married with children. It is impossible for us to fit into the single house allotted to us, says Rehman Khatoon, at Mekhliganj camp.Every single permutation and combination possible is taking place, says Ulaganathan. We even have a case where a man whose name was there in the 2011 headcount was later arrested in India for smuggling. He was then sent to Jalpaiguri jail, and is about to be released now. But he is no longer a Bangladeshi citizen and is also not enlisted in the camp.Inmates are also apprehensive about another thing left behind  their land. Land prices had stagnated in the enclaves due to lack of buyers from outside, and when they finally left for India and that land got freed, many of the migrants were not able to sell their plots in time.With the land swap allowing India and Bangladesh to take control of respective enclaves in their territory, the government is the new owner of their land.I owned two bighas  all of it agricultural land and extremely fertile. You could plant anything there and have a great crop. I have never had to borrow money in my life or depend on anyone else. My land fed me and clothed me. I had to entrust it to my relatives and friends to try and sell it and give me the money, says Kanti Mohan Roy, a resident of Haldibari camp.Many migrants have given a detailed list of their land  amounting to about 5 sq km  along with associated paperwork, to the district administration, requesting that it ensure a fair price for them.The Cooch Behar administration says the Bangladesh government has promised to buy the land at market prices and ensure that the money is transferred promptly to those who have chosen to adopt Indian citizenship.Ulaganathan says the district administration is simultaneously locating areas where land could be acquired and given to the migrants to begin new lives at the end of their two-year stay in camps. This land will be as close to the land they have left behind as possible in terms of its condition. We have singled out a few locations, he says.While the administration is also trying its best to accommodate the families as per their size, officials admit that for relatives left behind, there is no immediate hope. Well be writing to the state government and then they will communicate with the Centre and Bangladeshi government. As of now, there is no possibility of a second migration, says an official.Bharati was born in an erstwhile Indian enclave in Bangladesh.

Burman was a doctor back there and this bench has stayed with him since he first began practising almost a decade ago.I used to practise in the market, and since I was one of the few doctors in the area cant say I was a rich man but my life was comfortable. Here, things are different. My new identity is not that of a doctor, but as a migrant. I will have to start from scratch.Haldibari Camp: Those who have migrated to India from erstwhile Indian enclaves in Bangladesh are being provided with regular meals a day at designated dining halls at the camps for the first month. (Source: Express Photo by Subham Dutta) Haldibari Camp: Those who have migrated to India from erstwhile Indian enclaves in Bangladesh are being provided with regular meals a day at designated dining halls at the camps for the first month. (Source: Express Photo by Subham Dutta)Life as a doctor in the enclave wasnt easy, the 38-year-old admits, particularly as public health care facilities were negligible for those living in those areas. Naresh recounts having to diagnose everything from mental health issues to complications during childbirth.However, that feeling of not being useful any more gnaws at him. Im not sure what the Indian government has in store for someone like me. Will my degree in medicine count here? I cant farm like others. But perhaps, Ill have to learn, he says.Nareshs sisters opted to stay in Bangladesh. I wanted my daughter to have a good education so I came to India, the doctor says.But thats another worry that plagues parents. Two district education officers have visited each household in the three camps, enlisting the children into schools in the area. For young children, there are anganwadi schools here, while older children will be admitted into local colleges and high schools so that their studies dont suffer, says Kanti Chanda Roy, the district education officer.He adds that though the schools are understaffed, the government is taking measures to ensure more schools are built and teachers hired.But how about the children who were on the brink of giving their final examinations at school or college level? An official says they have taken this into account. Efforts are being made to ensure that nobody misses an academic year. Weve written to the West Bengal government education secretary to try and admit these students into good colleges, even if its in the middle of an academic year, he says.Naresh Mahanta (12) is among those enrolled already into a school. Holding up a Bengali language book, he says it is much better than anything he has seen before. It has colour pictures, he says excitedly.After taking a shower, he switches on the electric tubelight, another first, and sits down to complete his homework  painstakingly copying lines from his new book into the notebook that he has got.The district administration maintains that cases will be looked at individually and efforts are being taken to ensure that those in the camp can start working soon, and become financially independent. Almost 900 bank accounts have been opened, biometric enrolment for Aadhaar has been completed in all the three camps and job cards under MGNREGA have also been provided, while self-help groups for women and skill training have been arranged.This red carpet in a system where things move painstakingly slow isnt lost on the disgruntled residents of Cooch Behar outside the camp. When we told them we were getting job cards, they laughed at us. When finally they did believe us, they got very angry and told us there were hundreds of Indian residents who didnt get job cards despite trying. We are afraid that later they will still treat us like outsiders, says Santosh Burman, who is staying with his family at Haldibari.There is also the question of how long the governments commitment will last.On August 10, after visiting Cooch Behar to check on the preparations being made for migrants, Mamata had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying she hoped the Centre would release the amount as approved earlier.It was only on Wednesday that the Union Cabinet approved a package for rehabilitation and upgradation of infrastructure of former Bangladeshi enclaves and the Cooch Behar district. It pegged the funds required at around Rs 1,005.99 crore  Rs 107.49 crore of this variable, for rehabilitation, depending upon the number of families returning to India.However, the Mamata Banerjee government estimates the total expenditure to be around Rs 2,200 crore. The amount released by the Central government is far too little and doesnt take into account our everyday overhead costs. In many cases, we are yet to pay those providing services. For instance, none of the self-help groups providing food has been paid, an official says."

For the last three years he has practically lived on an unvarying lunch of six puris and aloo sabzi at a Jan Ahaar canteen near Red Fort. The 50-year-old rickshaw puller sometimes skips breakfast to save up money for his wife and three children back home in his village.But cheap as it is, food at the Jan Ahaar canteen still costs Rs 18 a plate, and on days when Singh is out of money he queues up at Gurdwara Sis Gang in Chandni Chowk for free langar. ""Lakhs of people in Delhi would starve if there was no langar,"" he says.Ramanand Sitaram, a labourer in Chandni Chowk, is used to sleeping on an empty stomach. ""You either sleep well or eat well,"" says the 55-year-old. He rents a cot for Rs 30 every night but often lunches on oil-soaked chhole bhature for Rs 10 at a fly-infested stall near a public urinal. Can't he eat better? ""Three meals will consume my entire day's earnings of Rs 200. I'll have to sleep in the street.""At a men-only night shelter near Qudsia Ghat, the occupants are all labourers but they skip dinner most days to save up. A community kitchen started for them by Beghar Mazdoor Sangharsh Samiti, an NGO, ran aground because of high costs and lack of subsidies. All the occupants of the shelter say they don't want alms but affordable food.Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees 'Right to Life' and Supreme Court has observed that it includes the 'right to food', but for lakhs of people in Delhi a decent meal is a far cry. It was to provide ""low-cost, nutritious and hygienic meals"" to them that the Delhi government started Jan Ahaar canteens in 2012. But in just three years, they have reduced from about 200 to 38.Aahar stall in a hospital in Bhubaneswar""The demand has dropped sharply and we get many complaints, so we have decided to get food tested in labs for the first time,"" an official from Women and Child Development department said. The programme is almost a lesson in how not to develop community kitchens, say some of the department's own officers.A Jan Aahar stallOnly 11 NGOs are running the canteens now. ""They haven't submitted status reports of sales for months. The aim for each canteen was to sell at least 200 thalis per day,"" added the official. Delhi government only allots space for the stalls but does not subsidise or monitor them.MENU DUMPEDThe scheme's goal was to provide 1,000 calories per meal with six puris, four rotis or 400 grams of rice. Puri was not to be served more than twice a week. For a wholesome meal, a thali needed to have one sabzi with dal or rajmah or chhole, or two sabzis, and a glass of packaged water. The lunch dishes could not be repeated for dinner. But TOI found that almost all stalls sell puris every dayon all days while rotis are made rarely. The sabzi is invariably potatoes and packaged water isn't served although the government has hiked the price of a thali from Rs 15 to Rs 18.""People prefer puri,"" said a vendor, adding, ""Jan Ahaar is declining in popularity, although we don't know why"". One reason could be the dwindling stalls. For instance, there is no Jan Ahaar Jan Ahaar canteen in Okhla where thousands of labourers work in factories.Pooris being made at a Jan Aahar stallEMPTY CALORIESThe draft food security Bill proposed to feed the homeless and needy through subsidised community kitchens, but the provision came unstuck as some MPs argued cheap food would make people lazy, says an activist associated with the food security movement.India does not have a 'cost of diet' analysis yet. COD is a method to calculate the cost of an affordable 'food basket' that satisfies all nutritional requirements. The poor in cities mostly eat cereals and low-cost fat because they can't afford anything else, says Suparna Ghosh Jerath, a nutrition expert at Indian Institute of Public Health, adding that their diets lack micronutrients and protein. ""Langars or community kitchens are better than cheap street food. The government should subsidise community canteens like Jan Ahaar. You can't expect vendors to provide nutritious food without any support.""Delhi government plans to launch canteens serving meals priced at Rs 5-10. ""Government will provide subsidy. The details are being worked out,"" said a government official who declined to share more details.Many see community kitchen schemes as a ""populist handout"". But Biraj Patnaik, principal adviser to Supreme Court's commissioners on Right to Food, disagrees. ""We have to stop viewing such programmes as charity. Every resident of the country has a right to adequate food and nutrition, and public feeding programmes should be seen as a legal entitlement.""(The report is supported by a Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) media fellowship on Good Food)"

Picking up a recent trend from Indian chefs in the west, restaurants are experimenting with Sino-Indian, Indo-Japanese, South Indian-Chinese and Indian-Italian flavours. Barely a month old, the trend already has city restaurants laying out a spread of innovative cuisine before foodies who are always ready to experiment.Chefs at the Hyatt Regency Pune conjure up a delectable platter of Thai curry-flavoured dosa, especially loved by expatriates.""Indian food is inherently spicy. A lot of expats want to try Indian food, but with fewer spices, and flavours rooted in other countries. Hence, the Thai curry dosa, which is the typical South Indian dosa mixed with a base of Thai curry,"" said Sarika Kamble, chef de cuisine, Hyatt Regency Pune.Other experiments include the Indo-Oriental paneer tikka with subtle flavours of lemon-grass, passion fruit rasgullas and gajar halwa stuffed dim sum, a fusion Indo-Cantonese cuisine. Most of these delicacies are served on request at the Hyatt Regency Pune and are not on the menu. ""Guests who want to try something different are offered these options and they love it. People are slowly realising that there is more to Indian food than just the traditional fare,"" said Kamble.New Delhi-based restaurant Indian Accent is known for its contemporary twists on Indian cuisine. Manish Mehrotra, corporate chef (luxury dining) at the restaurant, said, ""Chicken manchurian is supposed to be the earliest example of fusion food . There is nothing called chicken manchurian in China. The earlier writings of Indian chef Tarla Dalal would include recipes on several fusion foods, which have now been assimilated into the Indian food palate, such as paneer pizza or aloo patty burger,"" said Mehrotra.But of late, fusion food has taken newer forms and styles, where chefs blend ingredients and cuisines from two countries as if it were an art. It is far from culinary confusion, they say, for the mixing always works on logic. ""There is always a good reason why we mix two cuisines and styles together. For instance, we serve the guests with two pieces of blue cheese naan when they walk into the restaurant. There is logic behind creating this fusion. Blue cheese and bread is a classic combination used in several countries. We are simply using this classic combination in an Indian style,"" said Mehrotra.He added that he has a list of ""cardinal rules"" for any fusion. ""For instance, we do not mix two cuisines from India in a single delicacy. Also, we use different combinations of ingredients,"" he said.A case in point here is the restaurant's very own kaffir lime pav bhaji. Mehrotra thought that plating pav bhaji with a piece of lemon on top did not look very presentable. He then gave the pav a subtle hint of lemon by using the Southeast Asian kaffir lime. Other delicately crafted include pulled kathal phulka taco, beetroot and peanut butter tikki, and caper wasabi chutney.Mehrotra also said that fusion food was here to stay, and not just a trend that will pass like any other. ""Fusion food bing rustled up in fine-dining restaurants is a sumptuously positive development 's culinary world. People across the globe will know that India has food for every palate,"" Mehrotra said.Street Meat in Vimannagar, too, has come up with delicacies like Thai chicken 'gol gappe' and pulled pork bun pav burgers. Chef Nikhil Vaswani said, ""A staple food in one country is a delicacy elsewhere. While working at a few restaurants and abroad, it hit me that making different foreign flavours available to people at more affordable prices was the need of the hour. That is what Street Meat does. By putting Thai flavours in 'gol gappe', we try to introduce exotic flavours in an Indian base, intriguing local customers to the point of trying it out.""According to Bharat Malkani, president of the Federation of Hotels and Restaurant Association of India, western region (FHRAI), the concept of fusion food is growing rapidly in the country.""The Indian taste buds are looking for a change, and fusion food seems to have satiated that desire. The trend is rapidly picking up in Mumbai, which is basically a trendsetter for the country. Earlier, one would come across examples of fusion food at roadside shacks. But now, fine-dining restaurants are serving savoury courses of methodically prepared fusion food,"" he said.Chef Dipin Katariya at Mumbai-based Toast - Bistro & Bar said that most delicacies that have been successful with the Indian palate are either based on the use of parallel ingredients that form the base of Indian cuisine or those infused with Indian flavours.City-based Stone Water Grill in Koregaon Park, too, serves gourmet European, Indian and Japanese fusion food to its clients, such as the 'jheenga' kaffir lime curry (a coastal curry of king prawns with a flavour of oriental kaffir lime leaves), tandoor-roasted potatoes with Jamaican jerk spices, pickled prawn ravioli, and Madras curry and saffron infused seafood mariniere.According to chef Shailendra Kakade, guests like to experiment, but gradually. ""We as culinary experts need to take them through this journey step by step, so as to not let our patrons be overawed and ultimately put off due to a lack of understanding of the flavours in question,"" Kakade said."

Economists said both sets of data released on Monday remained within expectations but the pressure on some food prices could be a worry and the government would have to keep a close eye on food supply management. Economists said the build-up in retail inflation up to November 2015 was in line with the trends seen in November 2014.""While the CPI inflation print for November 2015 is modestly higher than expected, driven upwards by food inflation, it is not a cause for alarm. The expected reversal in prices of some perishables and pulses, the likely softness in global crude oil prices and consequently, domestic fuel prices, as well as the waning of the adverse base effect would contribute to keeping CPI inflation largely steady at current levels during the remainder of FY 2015-16,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA.Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) showed the consumer price index rose 5.4% (year-on-year) in November from the previous month's 5% and the consumer food price index rose 6% in November compared to October's 5.3%.Inflation measured by the wholesale price index fell 1.9% in November compared to a decline of 3.8% in October. Food inflation rose 5.2% in November, picking up from 2.4% increase in October. The RBI is expected to keep rates on hold for now. ""The RBI will continue to be watchful and is unlikely to tinker with rates for some time until a clear picture emerges on the US Fed action and inflation trends,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.""This time, the pick-up in inflation has been driven by a 140 basis points jump in food inflation, specifically pulses where the inflation rate touched 46.1%, vegetables, oils and fats,"" said ratings agency Crisil.""The rise in food inflation is a concern and now depends on a healthy rabi output and active food-supply management by the government. An increase in excise duty for petrol and diesel during the month, also pushed up inflation in transport and communication segments,"" said the agency.The WPI inflation data showed price of pulses rising 58.1% in November while those of onions shot up 52.7%. Potato prices fell 53.7% during the month. Prices of pulses and onions have been under pressure for some time and the government has taken several measures to tame the prices."

Instead of chucking them in the garbage, why dont we chop them up and stir fry them? i asked.So we did. And the stir-fried stalks tasted great. But while i was patting myself on the back for having invented a new recipe, i discovered  thanks to Bunnys Gurgaon Foodies group  that it wasnt new at all. In fact it was an old, traditional recipe and even had an official name given to it. Its called danthal, which not only tastes great but is also very wholesome, the stalks being by far the most nutritious part of the cauliflower.Similarly, the leaves of the mooli, the white radish, which are generally discarded can be turned into a palatable and healthy dish, which also helps you cut down on food costs.Coming as she did from the lean-ribbed aridity of Kutch which fostered frugality, my mother always ensured that there was never any wastage in the kitchen. After shelling peas, she wouldnt throw away the pods but turn them into a palatable dish. Shed do the same with potato peels.In the mango season, after the fruit had been eaten the large seed inside -called the gotlo in Kutchi  would be put into the smouldering embers of the coal-fired choola and baked. Cracked open after baking, the gotlo revealed an edible kernel. Years later when i first ate them in the chill of a London winter the taste of roast chestnuts bought from a streetside vendor would bring back memories of the hidden delicacy that lay buried within the heart of the mango.Had she been around today, my mother might well have published a book of recipes armed at minimising food wastage and maximising cost efficiency in the kitchen.But for all her ingenuity in devising tempting dishes i doubt if shed have been able to come up with a recipe which would make people  particularly people in the political profession  eat those most difficult of all things to eat  ones own words."

Such is the situation that a group of farmers of a Bathinda village has decided to plough their potato crop to clear the fields. Many more are facing the onslaught and may follow suit.Potatoes have been sown over 6,000 hectares in Bathinda alone. Farmers said that leaves were not developing due to virus and it was suspected to badly affect the crop yield.Potato is sown mainly in Kararwala, Pitho, Mandi Kalan, Bhundar, Dhapali, Kotra and Selbarah villages. Last year too, farmers had to face losses in potato crop as there was a bumper produce and prices had crashed. Some farmers had put the potatoes in cold stores, others went to the extent of dumping them on roadsides.In this week, village Pitho farmers Balbir Singh and Bant Singh ploughed the potatoes crop in 2.5 acres each whereas Kulbir Singh ploughed the crop in 3 acres.Balbir Singh said, ""I had sown potato, hoping to earn good money but the virus attack dashed all my hopes. The leaves had stopped developing since last few days and when consulted the horticulture department officials they found some problem in seed of potatoes. Seeing no hope I preferred to plough the crop.""""After the virus attack I decided to plough the crop and go in for other crop,"" he added.As per horticulture officials the virus is yet to be named. A scientist of Punjab Agriculture University said, ""We will check the virus and anything about its name and type could be explained only after that.""Farmer organization BKU Ekta Ugrahan district president Shingara Singh Mann said, ""The department needs to keep vigil so that the repetition of pest attack on cotton crop may not recur. We want the horticulture department authorities to visit villages and tell about the remedial measures to farmers.""Horticulture department deputy director Gurkewal Singh Dhillon said, ""The potato crop going to be bumper this year. The complaints of virus, which is yet to be named, are from very small area. Sometimes the problem occurs due to quality of seed. The farmers use old seed which is not recommended. The departmental team will be sent to the village on Monday to know about the virus attack."""

He had camped outside because in those days it was difficult to get foreign exchange.This was in 1975. I applied to IIT and for some reason they admitted me. But I had always wanted to go to MIT, so I applied there. The same admission officer made the same mistake and admitted me to MIT. The rupee was not a convertible currency and they only gave dollars to graduate students. So, basically they said, look, youre not going to get foreign exchange to go. And I couldnt even get a visa until I had some dollars to go.And so the story that you talk about is that I was very determined to go and I just went to the office of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.

So finally, at the end of the day, the secretary said Look, Ill give you five minutes.So when I walked into this cavernous room, somewhere around here, he gave me a way to get some foreign exchange. First he asked why I wanted to go. He said youre at IIT and thats a good school. Why do you want to go to MIT? But then he found a little angle for me that he could hang his hat on. He said that, if I want say I want to study nuclear engineering, or some branch of computer science that is not offered at IIT, then I could find a loophole to get you some foreign exchange. So I said, well of course, thats exactly what I want to study. So thats how I got the foreign exchange.Shivani Naik: And some years and many success stories later, hes here as the owner of the Sacramento Kings, valued at $535 million when he bought the team, in one of the biggest deals. Hes also credited with having digitised Wall Street. Basically what happens is, when you buy stock, it gets registered immediately. The real time updates is what he started.This was in in 1986. Thats when I invented the software.Shivani Naik: How did basketball come into the picture?I was trying to find ways to spend more time with my little girl, Anjali. She was 12-years-old. I foolishly volunteered to coach her basketball team. And for those of you whod like to read the famous writer Malcolm Gladwell, he wrote a story about this. His latest book, which is in the bookstores is David and Goliath. Its about me and my daughter and it talks about the story.So I said I was going to coach a basketball team just to spend more time with her. And I never actually touched a basketball and I showed up at this gym. It was a gigantic gym with multiple basketball courts. I looked around the room, and there were all these ex-division one Duke, Stanford players who were dads coaching the other teams. They were seven-feet tall. And then there was me.So I was standing in front of these girls and I realised that I was about to make a complete fool of myself in front of my daughter. I didnt know what to do. And so the first day I said to them, Girls, were going to run today. So I just made them run up and down for one hour because I literally didnt know anything about the game.But I hate to lose. I went back and studied the game a bit and I converted the game into a math equation. Basically, figured out a way to play the game and I ended up winning every single game and taking the team to the national championship.So thats how my love affair with basketball started.Mihir Vasavda: Malcolm Gladwell has very interestingly given the name to that story you mentioned, David and Goliath. How do you see yourself? David, the winner, or Goliath?Im always David. Theres a bigger lesson in that. If you think outside the box and you work harder than anybody else, then David can beat Goliath. And so I try to think of myself, my company, my team, as a David.Mihir Vasavda: How difficult is it to apply the logic you used with your daughters team, to an NBA team?Well I think the values apply. We actually have a D-League team. And by the way, the first Indian basketball player plays in that team, Sim Bhullar. We use that as a lab to see what ideas we can apply and what ideas are transferrable to the NBA. So I think that the values and concepts and the math applies regardless of the level.There is a lot of data now, since I bought the team. We looked at 30 gigabytes of data last year and I look at basketball as a big data problem.Smita Nair: When you talk about fans, were always fans of India when they go to play, say cricket. Since youre in the league format, how do you see this growing in a country where we are still to accept, say a Kolkata team? Were very regional and we still go as Indian fans. So how do you see the league format here?I think that in some ways whats unique about the NBA is that whether youre born in an African country, or Europe, or China, or Alabama. If youre a basketball player, you want to play in the NBA. Whereas in soccer there are many different leagues. So basketball is unique in that the NBA is the global platform and it transcends.Everybody loves Michael Jordan. And one of my partners is Shaq, Shaquille ONeal. Hes a global icon. Basketball is in someways more than a sport. I was with Abhishek Bachchan yesterday and hes a big Lakers fan. And obviously, having an Indian player in Sim Bhullar and having an Indian owner makes it, perhaps, more interesting to Indian audience.Smita Nair: What kind of conversation did you have with Abhishek Bachchan?Well, first we joked because hes a big Lakers fan. So I asked him what his favourite number was, and I said well, Ill give you a purple jersey with that number, but it wont be a Lakers jersey, itll be a Sacramento Kings jersey. We wear purple as well. He said forget about it, Im a Lakers fan for life. It shows the thought process. Hes been very successful with his soccer team, and with kabaddi. And he said that he saw great potential in basketball. So I invited him to come to the All-Star games. And he said that the Indian audience have a huge appetite for sports content. And that theres a lot of pent-up demand. And the kabaddi league validated that. And that mostly they watched movies that was good for his family business. But the younger, more affluent, upwardly mobile, is more into sports. So this is a great time to build up on basketball in the country.Devendra Pandey: Given a chance, would you buy an IPL team?You know, I did look at that at one point. But, perhaps not. Im interested and looking at soccer, Im looking at kabaddi. But Im always open to ideas.Mihir Vasavda: Weve had plenty of leagues coming up recently, but they havent been able to sustain themselves over a short period of time. How does that work over there in a business sense?I think the NBA has done a really good job of having a sustainable model on a number ofdifferent fronts.In the US there were two broad models. There was the American football model, where they had salary caps and everybody spent the same kind of money and everything was profitable.And at the other end of the spectrum you had the baseball model where every team spent whatever they wanted and, thats why every team lost money.I think basketball is moving more toward the American football model. Theres a very serious penalty for going above the cap. Theres a luxury tax.TV revenues are growing  theyve actually tripled in value. So I think that sports content is incredibly valuable. And the whole arena thing, though most people are watching from outside the arena.I dont know how many of you people have been to a basketball game. It is like the greatest show on earth. It is a magical experience, an intimate experience. Its 21st century communal fireplace. Its where people get together.Were building a new arena in downtown Sacramento. Its a $500 million project. Its going to be the worlds smartest building, its going to be the worlds greenest building. Its going to be comfortable. Its going to the be the worlds first indoor-outdoor arena.The arena is going to check in to you. So youre going to walk in, and its going to know who you are, its going to tell you where to park, itll direct you to your seat. You wont even have to take your phone out, because itll recognise you.But, only 50 nights will it be games, the other 200 nights will be concerts and performances. And Im hopeful that at some point in the next few years, well have world class arenas in India as well.Rhik Kundu: Given your technology background, would you consider a technology startup in India?I think that India is a great market, and also has great resources. So my software company TIBCO has many employees in Pune and Hyderabad. But I think that the best is yet to come as far as Indian technology goes.While a lot has been done, weve only scratched the surface here. So many of the great companies here are basically bodyshops doing cost arbitrage.Rhik Kundu: Would you consider a startup like that?Well, I would consider investing in companies in India for sure.Mihir Vasavda: Do you feel somewhere that sports persons are overpaid?Not really. I think its whatever the market bares. Like I said, its easier to be a brain surgeon than it is to be a centre in the NBA. Certainly some of those are gifts that are God given. But they still have to work really hard to make it at that level. They also work only for a few years. And thats also something that did concern me.So when I bought the team, the rookie that I drafted, Ben McLemore, came from Kansas to college and grew up in St Lewis. We had a summer league and I took the players out to a nice restaurant for dinner. He had never eaten at a fancy restaurant. So he didnt recognise anything on the menu. All he recognised was mashed potatoes. So he ordered mashed potatoes for dinner.So what I did was I created Kings Academy, where I teach my players life-skills. How do you invest your money, how do you order at a nice restaurant, how do you appreciate art, how do you create a life beyond basketball. I dont think they get overpaid, I think they deserve it.Shahid Judge: When youre introduced in public, are you the owner of Sacramento Kings who also owns TIBCO, or the other way around. And what would you consider yourself to be, given your love for basketball and being a Silicon Valley tycoon.Ive always been a technology guy and that will always be my passion. And basketball was more of a hobby for me.But people know me as the owner of the Sacramento Kings. In the business world, people know me as the software guy. Of course, Mukesh Ambani knows me as the software guy, before I got involved with basketball.But I just think of myself as a person that will continue to do things in technology.Shivani Naik: How tall are the doors at arenas?If you guys ever get to come to the arena, the first thing is that you need to go to the locker room and see how big their shoes are. These guys have huge shoes. Theyre giants you see how big and how strong these guys are.You make a good point. The counter tops are really high. Theyre big people. When you see a basketball game, and you see a short little guy, hes 64 or 65. So next to him youll be really small. And hes the little guy. But you dont notice it because theyre all so big. Its only when you stand next to them that you realise.Even their hands are huge. But they are insanely athletic. I have my players measured all the time, because Im big into fitness. So I measure their weight and their body fat, and their fat content on a regular basis. These guys are insanely athletic. They have five per cent body fat.Shahid Judge: Do you still coach once in a while, on the side?No. I give them my ideas, and whatever they want to take, they take. But I have very smart people in theorganisation.(Transcribed by Shahid Judge)For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"
308,Insurance sop to farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1151222/jsp/bengal/story_59739.jsp,2015-12-22,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Dec. 21: Agriculture minister Purnendu Bose today said the government would pay 50 per cent of the premium for insurance on crops except potatoes.Until now, the Bengal government gave half the premium for insurance only on paddy and wheat. The Centre bore the remaining amount.Bose said the plan could cost the Bengal government an additional Rs 150 crore annually. In the current rabi season, farmers grow pulses, grams, groundnut, mustard and maize.An agriculture department official said potato was not included in the scheme because it often suffered damage from blight, a fungus.The Centre had started the crop insurance scheme in 1999, when it paid 50 per cent of the premium and the rest was borne by the farmers.But after Mamata Banerjee came to power in 2011, she announced that her government would pay 50 per cent of the premium in insurance involving paddy and wheat.According to Bose, there are around 72 lakh farmer families in the state. The minister said the government had covered 15 per cent of the farmers under the scheme.""Our insurance scheme ensures that any farmer who has suffered a loss of over 33 per cent in production would be given Rs 1,000 as minimum compensation and upto Rs 27,000,"" the minister said.Sources said the government had chosen an opportune moment to expand the scheme to cover pulses and mustard, with months to go for the Assembly polls."
309,City's veggie waste may be used to fuel TMT buses,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/Citys-veggie-waste-may-be-used-to-fuel-TMT-buses/articleshow/50287609.cms,2015-12-23,The Times Of India,"Taking the first step towards a smart and a sustainable initiative, the municipal administration on Sunday announced plans to generate bio-fuel gas from the food waste and the green leftovers collected from hotels and markets in the city.The plan is to convert discarded cabbage leaves, rotten onions, tomatoes, potatoes and other vegetables from the markets, and the left-overs from eating joints into energy-efficient fuels. The green gas will reportedly be used to power the 128-strong fleet of the Thane Municipal Transport (TMT), which in turn will reduce air pollution.Municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal on Tuesday signed the memorandum of understanding with Prerna Institute that will be tasked with the responsibility of generating bio-fuel from the green waste.Officials said the plan is to reactivate the bio-CNG plant at Kalwa CSM hospital that was lying unused for a long time. Prerna Institute is undertaking the project as part of its corporate social responsibility initiative.""The operator will adopt the BARC technique to process all the green waste generated from city restaurants and vegetable markets to produce nearly 630 cubic meters of gas annually. It is more than adequate to fuel the 128 CNG-powered buses in the TMT fleet. Capacity of the plant will also be increased to 25 tonnes from the existing 15 tonnes,"" an official said.The nearly Rs 6-crore project will be completely funded by the corporate entity as part of its social responsibility initiative.The converted gas will then be purchased at competitive rates from the contractor and will be used to fuel the transport buses thus reducing the bills. The TMT presently operates 128 CNG powered buses and requires nearly 9,000 kg gas daily.""The TMC will not spend any money on the project and our role will be limited to transporting the green waste to the site daily. Further, the generated gas from the project can be used for fuelling the TMT buses that will save a lot as the rates will be 12% cheaper than the market value,"" Jaiswal said.Meanwhile, the TMC has also inked a ten-year deal with Thane-based Samarth Bharat Vyaspith for generating fuel from wood waste accumulated from the city."
310,Dry October spells rabi gloom,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/dry-october-spells-rabi-gloom/,2015-12-25,Indian Express,"If a poor kharif crop resulting from a second consecutive southwest monsoon failure wasnt bad enough, the prospects for the ongoing rabi season dont seem too great either.Rainfall during the current month has so far been 52 per cent below normal for the country as a whole. 30 out of 36 meteorological subdivisions, accounting for 90 per cent of Indias area, have received scanty or deficient rains in October. This comes on top of deficient rainfall in July, August and September.Making things worse is water levels in 91 major reservoirs. As on October 21, these were filled to only 58 per cent of their total storage capacity, as against last years corresponding level of 76 per cent and the last ten years average of 77 per cent. The reservoir water position is particularly poor in the Krishna, Godavari and Cauvery basins. Major reservoirs in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra such as Nagarjuna Sagar, Sriramsagar, Srisailam, Somasila, Malaprabha, Jayakwadi, Bhima, Girna and Khadakvasla have less than 33 per cent water relative to their live storage capacity.The combination of poor rains and low reservoir level does not augur well for the rabi crop, the plantings of which have just begun. The kharif crops failure due to dry weather in August and September had led farmers in many parts to pin their hopes on the rabi season and go in for early sowing. But with hardly any rains in October either, even this crop faces threat of moisture stress.The hope currently is from Northeast monsoon rains that have commenced over Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the adjoining areas of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and also developing western disturbances. The Met Department has forecast showers across peninsular India and parts of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand in the coming days. The lower temperatures accompanying these should help boost rabi sowings.The main rabi season crops are wheat, mustard, chana, masur, onion, potato and also  though these are largely grown during kharif  maize, groundnut, urad and moong. From a consumer perspective, a good rabi crop of pulses and onion would help cooling the price spiral in these commodities that arent easily importable.The Centre, meanwhile, is yet to announce the minimum support prices for the current rabi season crops, despite sowing already underway. A substantial increase in the MSPs of chana and masur would encourage farmers to expand area under these crops, which is in consumer interest as well.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
311,Shakurbasti demolition: Urban shelter board to plan and implement residents’ rehabilitation,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/shakurbasti-demolition-urban-shelter-board-to-plan-and-implement-residents-rehabilitation/,2015-12-27,Indian Express,"Life on a winter noon at a jhuggi cluster in Northwest Delhis Keshavpuram . (Express Photo by Abhishek Angad) Life on a winter noon at a jhuggi cluster in Northwest Delhis Keshavpuram . (Express Photo by Abhishek Angad)Hundreds of shanties that were bulldozed in Shakurbasti on December 12, rendering over 4,000 people homeless in the biting cold, were a part of 56 jhuggi-jhopri (JJ) clusters in Delhi on railway land. Of the 675 JJ clusters all over the city, 56 are on land owned by the Railways, which also partially owns the land on which eight other clusters stand.The Delhi High Court recently observed that landowning agencies cant just swoop down on a population and demolish everything. The following day, the court directed that a protocol for demolition of encroachments on government land be created.Although a survey is needed to assess the number of slum dwellers in Shakurbasti prior to 2006, the Delhi Slum and JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015, which was finalised last week, states that slums in existence prior to January 1, 2006 shall not be removed without rehabilitation.The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) will plan and implement in situ (in the natural or original position or place) rehabilitation/redevelopment of JJ clusters wherever it is technically feasible. In other cases, DUSIB will resort to the nearest possible relocation.Rehabilitation of slum dwellers living on land abutting railway lines, however, is tricky, said DUSIB CEO V K Jain. Last week, DUSIB officials met the district magistrate (West District) and functionaries of government departments to chalk out a plan to rehabilitate the residents of Shakurbasti.The board, in-charge of the rehabilitation, faces two challenges, said officials. There cannot be in situ rehabilitation of slum dwellers living on land abutting tracks because it is a safety hazard. This means they will have to be relocated to the nearest plot of land, added the officials. Most of them are cement workers and they offload cement brought in trains. They earn their livelihood here and it will not be easy to convince them to move, said a government official.The other challenge will be the cost of relocating people, which, according to DUSIB officials, will have to be borne by the Railways. Until these modalities are worked out, there can be no decision , said an official.Meanwhile, the DUSIB has provided temporary shelter to Shakurbasti residents who lost their home. The district administration has supplied relief material such as food, blankets, lights and water. The district administration made immediate arrangement of food for the affected persons by midnight and it also started erecting tents by around 3 am, said Amit Satija, district magistrate (West).The district administration has also supplied atta, rice, moong dal, onions and potatoes to all the families. They have also been provided mobile toilets, inflatable emergency lighting systems and torches.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Saurashtra region, which had seen high sowing during Kharif season this year, has reported sowing of only 49% for the winter crop.Reasons -water in 137 dams was only 34% against its total storage capacity of 2,526.59 million cubic meter.The state agriculture department officials said that the sowing was only in 24.72 lakh hectares which was more than 1.5 lakh hectares less than last year.The officials said that drawing of water from dams was very high, and in the past 24 hours, 254 million cubic meter of water from the dams was drawn. The so wing was less in those areas where Narmada waters have not reached. North Gujarat has the sowing in 93.76% of its area of 10.59 lakh hectares, followed by south Gujarat (82%) and central Gujarat (69.50%).According to the reports, the sowing of fennel seed was maximum. Against the sowing in an area of 22,600 hectares, the sowing was in an area of 40,500 hectares. This was an increase of about 76% of its usual sowing area.The high onion prices last year have led to the sowing in 95% of the normal sowing area of 44,900 hectares. The officials feel that this will cross the 100% mark. Similarly, the sowing of potato was almost 128% of normal sowing of 81,600 hectares.In north, central and south Gujarat there was adequate water available either through the Narmada canal or other big dams, but in Saurashtra the dams are almost dry and the government has decided to give priority to the drinking water which has resulted in low sowing."

However, the prices continue to be high when compared to the corresponding period last year.The prices of almost all veggies, except carrots and tomatoes, have tanked in the last few days. The unseasonal rains in December in Bengaluru Rural and Kolar districts  the vegetable growing belt around the city  led to diminished supplies in markets, which led to a rise in prices. However, the arrival of avarekayi saved Bengalureans, who took to the seasonal beans with vigour causing a dip in demand for other veggies.Avarekayi causing a crash in vegetable prices is an annual phenomenon.A senior HOPCOMS official said that during November-December, the arrival of avarekayi would cause all vegetable prices dipping to below Rs. 30 levels, but this season only potatoes are trading below Rs. 30.Price riseMeanwhile, reduced supply had led to prices of tomatoes and carrots skyrocketing this week too.

The ban will come into force from February 1, 2016. Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairman Manpreet Singh disclosed that defaulters would be fined Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 depending on the quantity of bags seized.For a kilogram of polythene seized, the fine would be Rs 500 and polythene bag weighing more than a kilogram would invite a penalty of Rs 1,000.PPCB chairman elaborated that manufacturing and distribution of polythene bags would be declared illegal and stiff action would be taken against the violators.Citing the example of neighbouring state, Himachal Pradesh, where the order banning polythene has been fully implemented, he said the programme required participation of people of Punjab.In a departure from the tradition, the government had made officers of all departments responsible for implementing the ban. Now onwards, the revenue department, police, principals of government schools, tehsildars, sub-divisional mgistrates (SDMs) and government doctors would be roped in for implementation of the ban on polythene.PPCB had also decided to install three imported equipment in Mandi Gobindgarh, Ludhiana and Amritsar to measure the level of air pollution, which would be passed online to the administration.Based on the information, the local administration, in cooperation with the PPCB, would be empowered to order shut down of air polluting industrial units. The machines have been procured at a cost of Rs 3 crore to the state.""Meat plants have also started sifting sludge from blood. The blood is dried and passed on to manufacturers of poultry feed.

This was the second time the chief minister took the help of the popular chat forum to reach out to potential voters.His audience was diverse and included an engineering graduate, a student, a media professional and a housewife, among others. Gogoi spoke on a range of topics, including price rise, disadvantages of importing food items and women's empowerment.Importing essential items like lentils, onions, potatoes and garlic from other states was hurting the state's exchequer, Gogoi said in reply to a question on escalating price rise and its effect on the middle-class. He added that the government was working on schemes to remove middlemen whom he held responsible for creating pressure on farmers.The state government was trying to offer rice at highly subsidized prices through producers' cooperative shops, said the chief minister. ""By having to buy essential commodities, our money is going outside the state. We want the money to be retained. We have to start working on schemes through which we can offer rice at Rs 2 and Rs 3 to the poor,"" said Gogoi and added, ""We need to think about opening shops to buy commodities from wholesalers and sell it to the middle-class. We need to phase out the middlemen.""A question posted by Gayatri Buragohain, an engineering graduate working for women's rights, stumped the chief minister. Buragohain asked Gogoi on what he intended to do for women's empowerment through technology as they were not encouraged to enter the technology sector. She asked him if there was a prevailing perception that women could not do certain kinds of work.Gogoi admitted that there was a need to provide women with technology in rural areas. He also said women were needed in jobs that required intricate detailing like design, handicraft and ornamentation, earning a sharp reply from Buragohain.""The idea that women are good in small work limits their opportunities. The entry of women in technology becomes all the more important,"" Buragohain told Gogoi."

At the same time, efforts are being made to increase the membership of farmers in cooperative banks, he added.On the spurt in cases of farmer suicides in the State, he said the desire to rise in life too fast is one of the reasons for farmer suicides.Lifestyle of farmers is also responsible for increasing suicides. I had come across an instance where a farmer owning a two-acre land in Kalaburagi had borrowed Rs 17 lakh. This is what happens when you want to rise in life too fast, Mukherjee, who served as bureaucratic head of the State for two years and two months, stated.The farmers require proper guidance. Banks should educate the farmers on taking loans and managing their finances, instead of focusing merely on recovery. The farmers are in distress because they are not getting the remunerative price. Prices of almost all manufacturing goods such as cloths and vehicles have gone up 30 to 40 times in the last few years. The prices of agriculture produce such as potato has increased by only about four to five times. In other words, the middle and the rich classes are getting farm produce at highly subsidised rates, he pointed out.He praised the State governments decision to introduce online trading at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) in order to ensure that the farmers get remunerative prices. The government has taken many other initiatives to bring about a change in the system and it would take two to three years to yield results, he said.He said he had good experience serving as the chief secretary though his job was a tough one. Jadhav is a good friend of mine. I have advised him not to take the ball outside the off stump, play only front foot, Mukherjee, who is a cricket fan, said."
319,Vegetable prices on the boil again,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Vegetable-prices-on-the-boil-again/articleshow/50389189.cms,2015-12-31,The Times Of India,"PUNE: Winter's when all kinds of vegetables flood the market, but tomato, lady's finger, cauliflower, cabbage, peas, carrot and a host of others don't seem to adorn the common man's plate as their prices have hit the roof.A deficient monsoon that even the November rain could not shore up has impacted supply. A kilogram of tomatoes, that was being sold for Rs 20-Rs 30 a few days ago, is now priced between Rs 40 and Rs 60.Okra and cluster beans command Rs 80 per kg in some markets and Rs 60 in others. Drumsticks, which have limited use in recipes, are a steep Rs 80 to Rs 100 per kg in the retail market and ridge gourd is being sold at Rs 100 per kg.A few months ago, prices of onion, potato and tomato along with other vegetables had hit the roof.Prices are up by 30% to 50% in some cases, as supplies in Market Yard are falling by the day. A drop in water supply for growing vegetables in and around Pune has resulted in little to harvest, directly affecting the demand-supply ratio.Annasaheb Ghole of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Pune pegged the shortage of vegetables arriving in the wholesale market at 20%. Retailers said there has been over 40-50% dip in supply of vegetables over the last few days.""The weak monsoon this year has had a telling effect on water storage in various parts of the state. Farmers were short of water for growing vegetables which has affected supply. The supply has been short for over a month now, though prices of vegetables in the wholesale market went up by about 10% only recently,"" said Ghole.The retail market prices showed area-to-area disparity, with some areas recording a 50% increase in the prices of various vegetables as against a few days ago. Another APMC official blamed the increasing demand for the steep prices. ""Scarce water for irrigation resulting from a deficient rainfall meant that farmers had no water for growing vegetables,"" he added.Sanjay Mule, who sells onions and potatoes in Market Yard on wholesale, said they have close to 80 trucks coming into the market each day with onion supply as against the 200-300 trucks that normally come this time of the year.""Farmers did not stock up water to grow vegetables after the monsoon ended badly. In addition, except for a few days, the state missed the usual cold this season. Lower temperatures are good to maintain the quality of vegetables. The produce coming to the market is sub-standard,"" he said.Sambhaji Phate, an exotic vegetable retailer in Camp, said there is dwindling supply of vegetables on the one hand and rising customers' needs on the other. ""But there isn't enough supply in the market to meet this demand,"" he added.Koregaon-based vegetable retailer Pravin Kolhe pegged the supply shortage at 60% in the retail market. ""We would get close to five vegetable supplying trucks earlier daily. It is down to two, or three on good days,"" he said."
