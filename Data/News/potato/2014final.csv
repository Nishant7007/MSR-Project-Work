Singh attributed the plummeting prices to the winter crop.Kothapet Rythu Bazaar, for instance, received 1,000 quintals of vegetables in a single day on January 12 as compared to the average arrivals of 470 quintals per day in July, 2013. The arrivals on some days reached up to 1,300 quintals too, informed Supervisor Padma.The Rythu Bazaars have an additional blessing, in vegetable cultivation being the primary occupation in many parts of the Ranga Reddy district. Mandals such as Shamshabad, Maheshwaram, Kandukur, Yacharam, Ibrahimpatnam, Shamirpet, Medchal, Shankarpally, Chevella, Moinabad and Vikarabad are known vegetable hubs."

The wholesale traders are expecting this scenario to continue till the last week of February and expect a further dip.Attributing the dip in prices to the good local harvest of tomato, potato, green peas, cauliflower, onions, the traders said there has been a 30% dip in the prices of the vegetables in this season so far compared to February, 2013.""The main reason behind this is a good harvest due to a good monsoon. Last year the monsoon created mayhem and played a spoilsport to the crop. The dip in the wholesale prices is attributed to the cheaper prices in retail,"" said Radhey Shyam Phatak, a wholesale vegetable seller at Muhana Mandi on Tuesday.The price of onion, which had burnt holes in the common man's pocket during September-November 2013, has come down to Rs 11 per kg in the wholesale market and is sold at a price range of Rs 15-20 in the retail market.Traders said farmers in Sikar, Chomu, Sanganer, Bagru and nearby villages have got a bumper crop and due to which the supply of vegetables has increased manifold.""This February has been cheaper compared to 2013 as there is at least a 30% dip in the prices of vegetables. We are not dependent on onions, potato and tomato from Nasik as the local harvest is ample this time,"" said Abdul Saleem, another wholesale trader at the Muhana Mandi.Traders said the dip in the prices of vegetables will continue till the second week of March. ""Till March 15 we are expecting to get the same kind of supply, thus during this period the prices are not going to increase but there could be a further dip,"" Saleem added."

The WPI was at 6.16 per cent in December.During January, inflation in food articles came down sharply to 8.80 per cent as against 13.68 per cent in the preceding month, according to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) data released today.Vegetables inflation came down sharply to 16.60 per cent, compared to 57.33 per cent in December.The rate of price rise in onion eased to 6.59 per cent in January, from 39.56 per cent in December. Inflation in potato stood at 21.73 per cent in January.Fruits were cheaper as were protein-rich items such as eggs, meat and fish.

19,19,Pace of price rise drops to  8-month low,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140215/jsp/business/story_17940284.jsp,2014-02-15,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Feb. 14: The rate of wholesale price inflation eased to an eight-month low of 5.05 per cent in January as food prices cooled, bringing relief to policymakers struggling to rein in the price spike. The lower inflation rate can come as a breather for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which may decide not to hike interest rates further. In December, the WPI inflation stood at 6.16 per cent compared with 7.52 per cent in November. Persistently high inflation had prompted the RBI to raise key policy rates last month, the third hike since September last year, even as the countrys GDP growth rate is likely to be below 5 per cent in the current fiscal. Januarys inflation rate is the slowest since May 2013, when wholesale prices increased 4.58 per cent. Consumer inflation had also softened in January, falling to a near two-year low of 8.79 per cent. However, core WPI inflation inched up to 3 per cent last month, its highest level since April 2013, which is a cause for worry. Core inflation excludes the volatile components of inflation; the RBI considers non-food manufacturing inflation as core inflation. A. Prasanna, chief economist with ICICI Securities, said, There may still be some scope for food inflation to decelerate in the near term. However, core WPI inflation increased to 3 per cent in January from 2.8 per cent in December. But is this reason for comfort or despair? To the extent the long-period average for the series is closer to 5 per cent , the underlying price pressures may still be deemed comfortable. Inflation in food articles in January came down to 8.8 per cent against 13.68 per cent in the preceding month as vegetable prices fell 21.4 per cent month-on-month. Onion prices climbed 6.59 per cent in January compared with a 39.56 per cent increase in December. Potato prices climbed 21.73 per cent in January. Fruits were cheaper as also protein-rich items such as eggs, meat and fish. However, inflation in milk inched up slightly up to 7.22 per cent in January. Data released this week showed retail inflation to decline to a two-year low of 8.79 per cent in January, while industrial output in December shrank 0.6 per cent, prompting calls by industry for an interest rate cut to boost growth. Todays inflation figures have backed up their demand. The declining inflation should spur the RBI to revisit its monetary policy stance and cut rates, CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said."

Although retail and wholesale markets across the city have started stabilizing, traders feel that prices will increase after the elections get over.Even a few months ago, markets across Kolkata have been facing a steep hike in vegetable prices. ""But it seems to have moderated a little now,"" said Kamal Banerjee, a trader in New Market.""Prices have come down in the wholesale markets in the last couple of weeks. Naturally, retail prices have also come down giving respite to consumers,"" he said.""Apart from potato, prices of all other vegetables have come down gradually in the last 15-20 days.

Prices of onion at the wholesale market have gradually come down from Rs 50 per kg some months ago to Rs 12-15per kg at present.""What has helped the state so far is a steady supply of locally grown onion. Production of onion in Bankura and Purulia earlier last year has helped in keeping prices low,"" he said. Similarly, prices of other vegetables like wax gourd (patal), lady's finger (dharos), brinjal, and cucumber have come down.""Prices of Jyoti variety of potato have increased from Rs 350 per 50 kg bag in March to Rs 550 kg now.

Prices of potato at New Market was between Rs 20 and 22 on Monday, while a gross variety of the crop, being sold as 'sarkari aloo' (potato supplied by the state government), was priced at Rs 14.Kamal Banerjee, a trader at New Market, said, ""It is not possible for us to lower the prices.

On the other hand, Future Group's Big Bazar sold 'Jyoti' variety of potato at Rs 22 per kg. While prices have gone up at the local markets in last one week, it has increased by merely 10 paisa per kg at the city malls.How could city malls sell the crop at a lower price while the local retail markets demanded a premium? According to cold storage owners, local retailers can sell the 'Jyoti' variety of potato even below Rs 20 per kg. Rampada Paul, president of West Bengal Cold Storage Association, said: ""After potato is loaded at cold storages, it changes many hands before it reaches the retailers. There is an average premium of Rs 2.50-3 per kg which is added during the process."" According to him potato was loaded at Rs 780-790 per 50 kg packet at the cold storages on Sunday.

Not that she is exempted from her duty as a senior official of the assessment department. After completing the 'special' assignment, she has to attend office regularly.Following an instruction from the chief minister's office to open fair-price shops at all civic markets, municipal commissioner Khalil Ahmed recently issued a circular requisitioning 264 Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) employees to be posted at different markets to sell potatoes. Some of these employees are senior officials (assistant or deputy managers), who were reluctant to be part of the team. But none could muster the courage to defy the municipal commissioner's diktat.No one can escape their duties, MMiC (market) Tarak Singh made it clear. Assessment department chief manager Souvik Sikdar has to prepare a report of the sale proceeds and hold a meeting with the MMiC every evening.Besides assessment, the civic body's market department employees are also part of the team that is now selling potatoes at 27 markets across the city, including Ultadanga, Manicktala, College Street, Gariahat, Lansdowne, Lake, Behala Parnasree, Sakherbazar, Jadavpur, Santoshpur and Bijoygarh markets.The task assigned to the KMC market department officials is to unload potatoes from trucks and sell these to customers who queue up in front of the municipal markets. The stock, which comes from the state agriculture marketing department, is sold at Rs 14 a kilo.Chinmoy Chatterjee, a KMC market department employee, looked worried on Tuesday evening when information reached the KMC headquarters that 22 truckloads of potatoes had been distributed among 27 municipal and other private markets across the city. ""We have to sell these potatoes over two to three days. This is in addition to our daily work,"" he complained.Chatterjee was even more worried to learn that from Wednesday, civic employees would also have to check the quality of potatoes being sold after complaints poured in at the civic headquarters that in some municipal markets, rotten potatoes were being vended. The MMiC, however, felt that the civic team had so far done a fair job to ease the pocket pinch of the common man."
