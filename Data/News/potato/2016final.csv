(Right) Roadsides in Long Bazaar have turned colourful with sale of rangoli powder.  Photos: C. VenkatachalapathyThe festival of harvest is here, and the markets are turning busy in Vellore. With sugarcane being integral to Pongal festivities, loads of cane has started to arrive to Long Bazaar from various parts of the State.Long Bazaar, which has always been a one-stop for all festival needs, is now buzzing with crowd shopping for the harvest festival.Cost of caneSale of sugarcane has started to pick up in Vellore. A bundle of sugarcane consisting of 18 to 20 canes cost Rs. 400 to 550 now. The cost depends on the canes height and thickness. Last year, a bundle was sold for Rs. 300 to Rs. 500, Aslam, a shopkeeper said.Vellore gets most of its sugarcane supply from Salem, Chidambaram and Kumbakonam, he said, adding, The yield was good this year but the rains in November damaged crops severely. Now, it seems that the government is procuring the damaged canes, and hence, farmers have been able to breathe easy. Vendors sell single sugarcane for Rs. 50 to Rs. 70.There cannot be sweet Pongal without jaggery. With jaggery being another key ingredient for the festival, the districts own-made jaggery is up for sale in Vellam Mandi. A kilo of jaggery costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 depending on colour. Jaggery produced from various parts of the district is supplied to other parts of the State including Chennai and Kancheepuram, said Rajendran, shop keeper at the mandi.However, he said that the sales were dull now when compared to last year. The production itself is less this year, he added.Vegetables cost reasonableThe cost of vegetables is nothing worrying, say vendors. Prices have been stable for sometime now. The rates of most of the vegetables are normal. On some days, there is variation in cost due to dip in supply. But consumers have nothing to worry while purchasing vegetables for Pongal festival, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.People buy pumpkin, yam, mochaikai, sweet potato and potato for Pongal, he said. A kilo of pumpkin cost Rs. 15, yam is Rs. 25-Rs. 30, mochaikkai is Rs. 30, sweet potato is Rs. 25-Rs. 30 and potato is Rs. 20. From last weeks rate of Rs, 60, the price of tomato (a kilo) is now Rs. 40.The roadsides of Long Bazaar have turned colourful with packets of rangoli powder being decked up at stalls.A packet of 100 grams of the colour powder costs Rs. 10. The sales will pick up today, a vendor said.Vendors in the flower market said the prices continue to be affordable for the festival season.Ropes and bellsApart from this, colourful ropes and bells to decorate cows are also up for sale in Long Bazaar."

But surprisingly this time, veggie prices have fallen owing to increased production and arrivals in the markets.A kilogram of tomato is now priced at Rs 6 to Rs 8 in wholesale markets, while carrots, beans and brinjals cost about Rs 20-25. Capsicum and potatoes are priced at Rs 15 and Rs 20, respectively. Exactly a year ago, their prices during the same period had spiked, with tomato priced at Rs 20 and beans Rs 40 per kilo.Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Association president R V Gopi said carrots were priced at Rs 40 in March last year and the cost of other veggies too had increased by 10-20 per cent.This time, however, the prices have fallen, especially in the past week. Last week, one kilogram of tomato was priced at Rs 15, but now it is available at Rs 8 and even Rs 5 in the market.He said the main reason for the low prices was the increase in the arrival of vegetables.Last year, there was a decrease in the crop arrivals and hence the prices had gone up. For consumers, it is a good news this time, but for farmers it is a loss.G M Diwakar from SKR Market Traders Association said it was just the beginning of summer season and there were chances of veggie prices doubling in the next four months.Generally, the prices increase between April and July. Last year, there was no rainfall and hence the prices had increased. It takes three months for crop yield and this time, there has been sufficient rainfall. But when the actual summer sets in, then the prices may increase."

However, farmers were misled by the government to cultivate the tuber last year and forced to make distress sale of their produce, the latest CAG report said.The report on economic sector for the year ending March 2015 said the directorate of horticulture facilitated cultivation of potato in various districts in 2015. The government on February 13 last year decided to purchase the produce through Markfed (in seven districts) and Nafed (23 districts).While Markfed was to lift 8,500 MT, Nafed was assigned to procure 20,500 MT. Markfed opened procurement centres in six districts but closed them without purchase on the pretext that it did not find potato of specified size, the CAG said.The CAG report said the government then lowered the procurement target of Markfed to 5,500 MT in three districts (Bargarh, Balasore and Jharsuguda). However, due to delay in procurement and lack of cold storage facilities, panicked farmers were forced to sell potato outside the market yard."

A quintal of onions, which fetched farmers between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,500 last month, was being sold at Rs 500-800 this week.It is not just onion cultivators who are suffering. Potato farmers, too, are finding the going difficult with prices falling. With about 25 to 30 potato lorries arriving at the APMC yard every day, prices have fallen from Rs 2,200 per quintal last month to Rs 1,400-1,500 this week.Subhash Marihalkar, a potato cultivator from Kadoli, has urged traders to stop the supply of potatoes from North India.However, Manohar Mungari, a trader, says that potatoes are being sold at a good price. ""Once the stock arrives from Delhi, the prices of potatoes will fall further. It is a misconception that traders are bringing the price down. We earn money only when farmers get a good price as our business depends on commission,"" he added."

A drop in trading activities was also reported from Osmanabad, Beed, Jalna and other districts.""Everyone in the market was trying to push Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. On the other hand, there were no takers for those notes,"" Isa Khan, a wholesale dealer from the city-based Jadhavwadi market said.Adding to the woes, prices of all agriculture produce particularly vegetables fell significantly after the Centre scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Onions, potatoes and other vegetables prices have been witnessing a sharp dip in prices after the Centre scrapped the high-value currency notes. Green vegetable prices, including that of coriander, spinach, 'methi' among others, slipped by almost 50% over the last two days dampening farmers' expectations. Prices of cauliflower, cabbage, ladies finger, capsicum and green chilies also fell by around 40% to 50%.Ratan Wakde, a farmer from Danora village from the district's Gangapur taluka, sold ginger in the Jadhavwadi market on Thursday at a wholesale rate of Rs 1,400 a quintal, which is Rs 800 less than Sunday's price. ""On Sunday, ginger was priced at Rs 2,200 a quintal, but I do not understand the sudden drop,"" Wakde said.The APMC's yard in Parbhani wore a deserted look on Thursday, where many grain merchants suggested that farmers should not bring soyabean and other agriculture products for the next three to four days. ""I have a huge stock of the soyabean, but the current market conditions are not favourable to sell the crop. A few days ago, soyabean was sold at Rs 2,700 to Rs 2,800 a quintal. But, today some buyers were offering Rs 2,300 a quintal. I don't wish to sell the crop at such low rates and so I stayed away from the market,"" Sopan Garud, a farmer from Parbhani, said."

Price of fish is also down by Rs 50-70 a kg. But it has not elicited a smile yet from customers struggling with cash. At Lansdowne market, Jadu Babur Bazar and Lake Market in south Kolkata, onion price has nosedived from Rs 25 a kg prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's demonetization announcement on Tuesday to Rs 18 a kg on Saturday. A similar situation was witnessed at Maniktala market in the northern part of the city.""People are just not buying unless absolutely necessary. One generally says that Bengalis will never compromise on food but I suspect less fish and meat dishes are being made now. So the demand for onion has dropped. Though supply in wholesale market has dipped because of the liquidity crunch across the country, there is still a glut due to lack of demand,"" said Asit Das, a vegetable vendor at Lansdowne Market.With dues piling up and pressure to clear the stock mounting, vendors are reducing prices. Everyone associated with onion, right from the farm in Nasik to here, is desperate to kick-start sales. ""At any other time, a drop in supply would have led to price rise. But it's just the opposite,"" said Mahadeb Mondal of Lake Market. ""While commodity prices dip normally when there is a liquidity crunch, the trend has so far been missing in Kolkata. But this time we see that happening,"" said Shankar Gupta, a vegetable trader in Kolkata.Price of tomato that comes from farms near Bengaluru is also headed southward, having dropped by Rs 2 in two days and is now retailing at Rs 18 a kg. ""The suppliers are not accepting payment in the demonetized currency notes and have agreed to take the payment later. They have slashed the price so that we accept the stock in this adverse situation,"" said Das.Price of Jyoti variety of potato that commanded Rs 20 per kg till Thursday was selling for Rs 18 on Saturday.Lower consumption has also brought down fish prices at city markets by at least Rs 50 per kg across varieties."

While there were certain variations across city markets, the overall price curve continued to slide downwards 10 days after the demonetisation move.Markets across the city witnessed low sales even on Thursday. ""I have barely sold 15kg potato since morning. Normally we sell around 120kg each day. The slump has pushed us into a severe cash crunch,"" said Gopal Kundu, a vegetable vendor at Lake Market Potato prices have witnessed the sharpest dip in the past three days after wholesale prices came down to Rs 11 per kg for the Jyoti variety on Wednesday. ""Based on the grading of the Jyoti variety, prices varied between Rs 11 and Rs 12 at the wholesale markets,"" said Patit Paban Dey, former president of West Bengal Cold Storage Association. ""It seems that farmers needed cash to stay afloat and decided to release potato at a lower price,"" he added.""We are yet to receive the Nasik variety of onion. But the prices have come down further. This normally happens when the market is flush with new produce,"" said Shakti Prasad Ghara, a vegetable vendor at the New Market.

Only 5,000 crates of pomegranates were supplied by farmers, instead of the regular average of 15,000 crates. In Neera market, the auction of jaggery dropped by almost 50%, with the unloading of about 1,000 boxes as against the daily standard of 2,000 boxes. Meanwhile in Junnar , trade in fresh vegetables, onion, tomatoes and potatoes was down by 40%.Traders and farmers at these local markets have traditionally preferred transactions in cash, and were caught off-guard by the sudden announcement. The cancellation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has affected the payments, while purchases have also suffered. Even prices have dropped because of the low demand for farm produce.Officials in the agriculture produce market committee fear that more time would be required before things return to normal.An official attached to the market committee in Indapur said, ""Pomegranates have a huge market here, and a daylong auction registers transactions amounting to over Rs 50 lakh. This is peak season for pomegranate sales. We were expecting a rise in trade. However, for the last week, it has dropped drastically. Cash crunch forced traders and farmers to suspend auction because of the ban on cash transactions using demonetised notes. The auction finally resumed on Saturday to recover losses.""Local sources said that pomegranates had piled up in the orchards and if not sold soon, will rot, causing losses. So farmers and traders were left with no choice but to go ahead with trade.Soybean is ready for harvest in most parts of Baramati , and growers are likely to face losses if auction is not held.Even auctions of foodgrains like wheat, jowar, bajra, maize and soybean were completely halted for a week. The agriculture produce market committee said that supply of foodgrain dropped by almost 50% in last 10 days, and even traders were not unwilling to auction off their produce at lower prices. The committee was hopeful that action would resume on Monday. Local sources in Junnar-Ambegaon-Khed , which is predominantly known for cultivation of vegetables, said despite a good yield, business has taken a hit.Meanwhile, the government's latest move of increasing withdrawal limits for farmers, to Rs25,000, was met with scepticism. ""Cash is not available at most banks. Farmers cannot spend the entire day standing in queues in banks. Also, there are limited branches of nationalized banks in rural parts so farmers are badly hit,"" said Ashok Banker , a resident of Ambegaon area."

Compare this with prices just a month ago, when tomato was retailing at Rs. 30 a kg. While a good yield over the last one month has normalised supply, tomato growers have now been affected by the post- demonetisation cash crunch.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to States such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and in case of tomato, even to Kolkata.Supply of tomatoes to Tamil Nadu was affected during the Cauvery crisis. Now there is cash crunch, and transportation has been hit, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato grower from Nukkanahalli in Kolar disitrct, and added that farmers were suffering huge losses.Vegetable prices have also been crashing: a kg of beans is now selling at Rs. 14, onion at Rs. 16 and potato at Rs. 26. The prices took a hit over the last two weeks. This is despite the fact that November and December usually see vegetables retailing at higher prices in Bengaluru.The prices have come down by over 30 per cent in the last week alone, said a senior official heading the vegetable procurement section in a leading retail chain.Keshav S.H., manager, Marketing, Hopcoms, said that another reason for the falling prices has been falling retail sales, indicating lower consumption of vegetables, creating a high supply and low demand cycle.However, procurement officials fear that the supply-demand cycle may soon be reversed if the cash crunch continues for a longer period, affecting crop patterns.Now, vegetable growers are resorting to distress sale. But they are not being paid for their produce immediately, further worsening the cash crunch. If this affects sowing this season, then we will soon stare at low supplies and skyrocketing prices, the official said.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to markets"

The sluggish acreage is going to affect production of the early variety (jaldi aloo) that usually reaches the market by mid-November.But this was not expected when Bengal farmers, the second tuber producing state after Uttar Pradesh , had made huge profits in the last season. ""The November chill is ideal for potato farming. But where is the money?"" said potato grower Kinkar Das from Tarakeswar. Kinkar hasn't been able to sow potato seeds entirely in his 2.5 bigha land. ""I sowed in only 1.5 bigha, leaving the remaining for less expensive farming such as brinjals and radish,"" Das said.Gopinath Khanrui from Singur has major stakes this year. Unable to get credit from the Krishi Samabay Samiti, Gopinath has arranged for Rs 60,000 by mortgaging his wife's gold jewellery and the rest as loan from seed and fertiliser agents. A small section without having bankable assets has taken loans from big farmers and money lenders at 10-12% monthly interest, a trend that is a cause of worry for the administration. State officials fear that such high stakes may increase the possibility of farmer suicides.Seed and fertiliser agents have no other option to give the items on credit. ""If we don't, our business is going to suffer. What's the use of having unused stocks when seeds have a limited shelf life. We are thus giving the items to farmers based on a written undertaking that they will pay back during the harvesting season,"" said trader Pradyut Das. Even seed and fertiliser prices have recorded a dip due to the liquidity crunch. The Punjab Potato Seed Federation has already approached Bengal agents with a request to collect the money from farmers in old currency notes. West Bengal Potato Seed Trader Association secretary Swapan Samanta who is also the Tarakeswar Municipality chairman, however, isn't taking chances. ""I have intimated the state government about the proposal and am waiting for the response. I came to know that the Punjab government has endorsed the move. But there is no use taking the old currency notes unless Bengal government gives a go-ahead,"" he said."

At the farm level, however, there is a crisis of capital that continues to bother tuber growers even after the Centre's assurance of giving fresh loans to farmers for the sowing and harvesting season. Potato may pinch pockets in the coming season as there has been a drop in its acreage.Tarakeswar Aloo Byabsayee Samity secretary Swapan yee Samity secretary Swapan Samanta put it straight. ""I have come to know that 359 Krishi Samabay Samitis in the Hooghly district will get Rs 50,000 each. If this works out, the total amount adds up to around Rs 2 crore. The outgo as loans during the last season was Rs 212 crore. The KSUs can't disburse the paltry loan amount on their own.They have to give names and address of the farmers and send the list to the central cooperative bank in the district.The bank won't sanction lo ans to those who have taken loans earlier,"" Samanta said.A back-of-the-envelope calculation gives a feel of the calculation gives a feel of the ground reality . ""Potato cultivation for a bigha costs a farmer an average Rs 20,000. I have five bighas and I need Rs 1 lakh for the farming. But the KSU has a total kitty of Rs 50,000. It can meet only a small fraction of the demand.Farmers can't wait. Some have bought seeds and the minimum fertiliser on credit making a payment assurance of Rs 50-100 more after the yield.Some have left parts of their land empty . The result is for all to guess,"" Samanta said.While Hooghly farmers have got a hint of the Centre's loan disbursement, Burdwan district magistrate Soumitra Mohan hasn't got any such communication. ""I am not aware of any such communication to the central cooperative bank till date,"" the DM said. Bankura district officials also sounded non-committal.This has left the potato growers in vast stretches of Joypur, Simplipal and other parts of Jangalmahal in the lurch."

This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

The distribution drive, planned outside the UP Legislative Assembly building, is aimed at drawing the government's attention to the acute problems being faced by farmers across the country, exacerbated by the government demonetisation move which had led to a liquidity crunch.Speaking to TOI, BKU's Lucknow spokesperson Alok Verma said, ""Farmers have not been able to sell their potato and paddy produce and the markets are lying empty . To make ends meet, a large number of them were forced to make distress sale of paddy at Rs 600 to Rs 800 per quintal even though the minimum support price declared by the government is Rs 1,470 per quintal. Now, demonetisation had crippled business further because farmers have no money to buy seeds, DAP , and fertilisers to sow the rabi (winter) crop. They are dumping their produce in the state capital in the hope that the government will take note and do something for them.""Until Tuesday night, 22 trucks-full of paddy and potaoes had landed up outside the BKU office in Lucknow. Verma claimed that potatoes and paddy in excess of 100 quintals will be up for grabs outside Vidhan Sabha. ""Our distress is not a joke.Farmers have given their sweat and blood for this produce and they are getting no buyers. We have to feed our families too.And the government is turning a blind eye to the country's ""annadaata"","" Verma added."

""Moreover, there had been rise in arrival of vegetables in the market. All this led to decline in prices.""Uttam Avhad, a farmer from Sinnar said, ""The wholesale prices of vegetables have declined after demonetisation. Today, I bought 15 quintals (1,500kg) of cabbages at the rate of Rs 100 a quintal or Re 1 a kg during auction. Hence, I did not sell my produce to traders. I started selling the cabbage directly to retailers at Rs 3 kg. I sold almost all the stock but I had to stand up throughout the day... Some people bought two to three kg as they were cheaper than that in the retail market.""""I came here after a fortnight to buy vegetables. I purchased a stock for almost a week. Prices were cheaper comparatively,"" said Ankit ShuklaTomatoes, which were sold at Rs 20 a kg on November 7, declined to 10 a kg on December 2 due to decline in demand as compared to supply. Chilli prices declined from Rs 30 a kg to Rs 15 a kg. The prices of cauliflower and cabbage also declined from Rs 20 a kg to Rs 10 a kg each after demonetisation.While prices of most of the vegetables declined up to 50%, it was only onion that was little costlier . In the retail market, onion prices have increased from Rs 10 a kg to Rs 15 a kg after demonetisation."

Potatoes, which according to quality were fetching wholesale prices between Rs4 and Rs11 per kg, just a week ago, are now being sold at Rs1.5-Rs6 per kg. In the retail market, prices of potatoes have climbed down from Rs18-Rs22 per kg to Rs11-Rs15 per kg.Deepak Patel, secretary, APMC, Ahmedabad, said, ""Last year at this time, potato prices were at Rs8 to Rs10 per kg, but this year it has dropped to Rs1.5 per kg. The potatoes we are getting now are local potatoes, which are from cold storage.""Speaking on the price drop of potatoes, Kishorekumar Lachhmandas Paryani, a trader in APMC, Ahmedabd, said, ""The old stock is being released from cold storages thus leading to the drop in prices."" Paryani said last year's crop was bountiful and thus the amount of potatoes stocked in cold storages was higher than usual.""Old stock will continue to be released for another month until the new potato crop starts arriving,"" said Paryani.Retailers, however, are of the opinion that there will be no further price drop, and that prices have stabilized.Richa shah a homemaker from Satellite said, ""I don't know whether potato prices will remain low in the coming days, and so I have decided to make and store potato wafers, which I usually do on arrival of the new crop."" She was happy that prices of most vegetables have dropped.Farmers in the state had received good prices for their crops in April 2016 despite 15% increase in production. As compared to Rs5-Rs6 per kg they received for potatoes in April 2015, in 2016, the new crop had fetched them around Rs10 per kg in the wholesale markets.Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda. Potatoes from Gujarat are supplied to Maharashtra and states in South India. They are also exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Mauritius."

Export of potatoes used for making snacks has increased in the last few years and will grow further with rising demand, experts at the International exhibition of cold chain expo said on Friday.The claims about good prospects for potatoes came at a time when a strong protest was held here by farmers who claim that potato prices have come down to Re 1 per kg. Manohar Shardiya, managing director of a cold storage said, ""With a rise in the snacks industry, demand for potato is growing rapidly in the state. Malwa potatoes are preferred for exports because of its high quality and taste. Top quality potatoes are exported while average and inferior ones are sent to local markets for consumption.""According to data from the agriculture department, farmers have sown vegetables that include potato and garlic on 30,000 hectares in the region this rabi season as against the target of 22,000 hectares.With disposable income in the country on the rise, the snacks industry is growing at a rate of over 10 per cent per annum according to experts.""Rapid growth of the snacks industry is boasting of a high demand for potatoes. The need for cold storages has also gone up so that produce can be stored longer and quality can be maintained,"" Shardiya said.With the upgrading of technology and rising production, the trend for multi-commodity cold storage chambers is rising in the country. Of 65 cold storages in Indore district, 40 are multi-commodity cold units.There are 210 cold storages in Madhya Pradesh Hansmukh Jain Gandhi, president, MP cold chain Industries Association said, ""The state has great potential to become a hub for cold storages due to its demographic advantage and high production of fruits and vegetables. Production of potatoes, cabbage, carrots and fruit such as oranges have grown in the past few years.""However, experts said that the state should improve its technology and farmers should get connected with the market for better opportunities. Pawanexh Kohli, CEO and chief advisor, National Centre for Cold chain Development said the state has the potential to build more cold storages but the selling radius for farmers should be expanded so that they can connect with their own choice of markets."
345,345,Distress sale by potato hoarders as stocks arrive,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Distress-sale-by-potato-hoarders-as-stocks-arrive/articleshow/56092500.cms,2016-12-21,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: A section of potato farmers , who hoarded the crop in cold storage till the last moment to reap a windfall, is now resorting to distress sale of their stock. Liquidity crunch and fresh supply of potato from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have changed the game altogether. The wholesale price of Jyoti variety of potato crashed to Rs 2-3 per kg at markets closed to cold storages across Bengal. However, the crash has a little impact on the retail markets in the city.This year saw the least potato production  9 million tonne  in Bengal compared to earlier years. So, many farmers and middlemen calculated a good price if they managed to hoard a substantial amount of potato. A section of farmers, middlemen and cold-storage owners fudged this year's actual storage to jack up the price. So, when the actual storage was 6.5 million tonnes across 462 potato cold storages in Bengal, it was shown only 3 million tonne. This led to abnormal rise of potato price in both wholesale and retail markets.Potato economy of Bengal is always erratic. It is one of the most risky farming bets. With a contribution of 25% in India's potato output, Bengal is the second-largest producer of the vegetable after UP. ""A section of middlemen and traders speculate the probable price of potato every year, keeping in mind the production of potato and its price in previous years. But things often go haywire when ground reality changes,"" said Shankar Adhikari , an agriculture economist.November 30 was the last date for clearing entire stock. But government found a huge stockpile of potato in the cold storages. Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta extended the last date of clearing the stock till December 8. But even after that the government found a huge stock uncleared. Now that section of farmers and middlemen find it difficult to withdraw the stock from cold storages as the cost overshoots the wholesale price.Paschimbanga Potato Traders Association president Swapan Samanta said: ""Liquidity crunch along with fresh supply of low-cost potato from Punjab has changed the game. Bengal potato now has hardly any buyer. The potato retail price now should be below Rs 8 in Kolkata's retail markets."" Traders are jostling to sell before the new crop arrives in December end, failing which the old one must be destroyed."
362,362,Demonetisation leaves farmers high and dry,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/Demonetisation-leaves-farmers-high-and-dry/article16961735.ece,2016-12-30,The Hindu,"In Hassan district, many farmers have kept their stocks of potato, maize, ginger, and other crops as there are no buyers. Seen here are farmers at the agro produces market in Mosale Hosahalli of Hassan taluk. PHOTO: PRAKASH HASSANWhile urban areas in the State are adapting themselves to the changed scenario after the demonetisation of high-value notes, rural areas, especially farmers, continue to be under duress even 50 days after demonetisation.With no improvement in cash flow in villages, there are no takers for farmers produce.The fall in demand has triggered a drop in prices of agricultural produce.In Hassan district, many farmers have kept their stocks of potato, maize, ginger, and other crops as there are no buyers.As those who harvested potato in September/October got Rs. 16 a kg, the farmers who were harvesting the produce in November/December were hoping for a further increase in prices. But, much to their dismay, prices have crashed to Rs. 10 a kg.In this situation, many have not sold their produce. Three truckloads of potato have remained unsold in our village, said Papaiah, a farmer from Marenahalli near Mosale Hosahalli in Hassan taluk. But the stock has started to perish forcing some of them to sell at Rs. 4 a kg. The case of maize growers is no different. The price of maize has dropped to Rs. 1,300-1,400 a quintal from the level of Rs. 1,600-1,700 before demonetisation. Also, farmers have to bear transportation cost as traders have stopped farm-gate purchases after demonetisation in most of the areas.The coffee growers are also hit as demonetisation has coincided with the harvest season. A coffee planter with 25 acres of plantation needs to pay wages of about Rs. 45,000 a week as he hires about 25 labourers. But, one can only withdraw a maximum of Rs. 24,000 a week from the banks, say planters.U.M. Thirthamallesh, secretary of the Karnataka Coffee Growers Federation, says, Because of the cash crisis, planters are hiring less number of workers this year, resulting in delayed picking, which may affect the quality of coffee beans, besides harming the plants in the long run. In northern districts like Kalaburagi, farm labourers have started demanding a part of the harvested produce as their wages instead of accepting money, as several landlords are trying to give them old currency notes.What has added to the woes of farmers is that most of the ATMs in rural areas have remained closed due to paucity of cash."
