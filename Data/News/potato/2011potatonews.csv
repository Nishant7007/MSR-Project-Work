1,Will clear imported onions from Pakistan by tomorrow: JNPT,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/125922/will-clear-imported-onions-pakistan.html,2011-01-03,Deccan Herald,"Will clear imported onions from Pakistan by tomorrow: JNPTLast updated: 03 January, 2011Mumbai, Jan 3, (PTI): 17:45 ISTJawarhalal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) authorities gave an assurance today that over 200 tonnes of imported Pakistani onions that have been lying in the port area in Mumbai since December 29 will be cleared by this evening or tomorrow at the latest.""We have eight containers of onions imported, which arrived on December 29 from Pakistan, and it is going through the mandatory clearance processes. The consignment will be released by late this evening or tomorrow,"" JNPT Deputy Chairman N M Kumar told PTI here.Clearance is taking time as consignments imported from the neighbouring country have to undergo a rigorous screening process for security reasons, he said. Furthermore, being agricultural produce, the consignment also has to go through a mandatory Plant Quarantine (PQ) clearance process for detection of any bacteria or virus, in addition to the normal customs duty protocol, he said.""All the three steps are taking time as there are eight containers, which have to go through 100 per cent scanning,"" he said. He said that onions normally survive for 10-15 days and the consignment will reach the markets with plenty of time to spare.""Normally, onions survive for 10-15 days and this consignment, after all the necessary clearances, will reach the wholesale markets for retail disbursement with ample time. I think this has become a issue as onion is a sensitive matter,"" he added.Private traders have been importing onions from Pakistan since December 21. Later, the government decided to allow state trading agencies PEC and STC to import 1,000 kg of onions from Pakistan. Till date, over 5,000 tonnes of Pakistani onions have been imported into the country by road through Amritsar.Meanwhile, the government has abolished import duty on onions and banned exports of the commodity for an indefinite period. Unseasonal rains in Maharashtra and Karnataka have hit production of the late kharif crop, resulting in the surge in prices of onions.Agricultural Produce Market Committee Onion and Potato Mandi Director Ashok Baluji said prices are likely to ease after January 15, when fresh crops from Pune start arriving in the markets here.Onions were ruling at Rs 50 per kg in retail markets here today, while the wholesale rate stood at Rs 35-40 a kg."
2,The air in the bag,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110106/jsp/opinion/story_13395364.jsp,2011-01-06,Telegraph,"The inflation imbroglio in India is rapidly getting out of hand. What is the cause of inflation and what is its remedy? Let us take the example of potatoes. Potato prices in the market have been Rs 40 per kilogram. But farmers get Rs 1.50 to Rs 3.50 per kg. Where does the remainder go? A structural change in Indias economy can be one of the causes behind this huge gap. Take the case of manufactured food products. The unit price per ounce of a manufactured food product is 20 to 50 times higher than that of the raw material from which it is made. Take potato chips. A kilogram of potato chips will cost you at least Rs 300 per kg at the American Dry Fruit Stores at Flora Fountain in Mumbai. If you buy it in the small packages that Frito-Lay sells in India, it will cost you almost Rs 600 per kg. What you pay for, then, is a fancy piece of packaging with a brand name and the air in the bag. The quantity of potatoes is minuscule. The nutrition value is non- existent. We are so proud of our rural distribution system that we take pride in the fact that the humblest village retailer has several flavours of assorted potato chips, which the farmers children can buy at his shop. But we have forgotten that perhaps the same farmer grew the potatoes and could sell them to middlemen only at Rs 3.50 per kg. So where has the balance of Rs 596.50 per kg gone? Between the farmer and the buyer of potato chips, a number of manufacturers have added on costs and dubious middlemen have taken their cuts. This, of course, reflects the reality of liberalization. Indian consumers have never had it so good. They have been seduced into paying several times more for a manufactured food product that will be of immense food value to them. Or so they believe. There is another dynamic process going on here. As the number of middle-class consumers rise, demanding greater quantities of manufactured products, the relative amount available per person for those who simply want the basic items declines sharply. As the number of food processing companies in India rise, they purchase increasing amounts of raw materials for their packaged items. If this growth in demand were accompanied by a corresponding growth in supply, as happened during the late 1960s and 1970s, all would have been well. But ever since the supply of agricultural raw materials has come to a shuddering halt, because of severe stagnation in Indias agricultural production, the amounts available for the common man are declining steadily on a year-to-year basis and prices are skyrocketing. This is the contemporary Indian tragedy. The growth in demand has simply outstripped the growth in supply. As a result of basic food items being purchased at high prices, the greater portions of the incomes of average Indians are spent on buying day-to-day necessities. There is little left for spending on developmental activities like education. This situation has the potential to exacerbate the already severe inequalities in the Indian economy. What should the government do here? The sale of certain important items, including grains, fruits, vegetables, pulses, fish, meat and other sources of protein, at fixed prices through the public distribution system is a must. The supply management process also involves the monitoring of production, of supplies at mandis, enforcement of price codes and so on. Indias free-market traders have never been oriented towards the common mans welfare. The so-called growth story driven by liberalization is a pipe dream. It has been a liberalization of profiteering. Control profiteering and manage supply, and the inflationary dragon will be slain, and the welfare of the common man ensured."
3,Soaring vegetable prices hit taste buds,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/Soaring-vegetable-prices-hit-taste-buds/articleshow/7231288.cms,2011-01-06,The Times Of India,"ALLAHABAD: The soaring prices of vegetables have once again spoilt the taste of common man, who otherwise eagerly awaits the winter season to enjoy the best of vegetables and other food items.There has been a marked increase in the prices of vegetables including potatoes, onion and spinach in various markets in the city like Loknath, Meerapur, Khuldabad, Katra, Mumfordganj and Rajapur, where the attendance of daily shoppers has come down owing to the shooting prices of essential vegetables, said Ranjana Kapoor a resident of Meerapur, who added that soaring prices of vegetables has disturbed the monthly budget of householders.The price of tomatoes is Rs 15-20 per kg, onion is being sold at Rs 40-45 per kg while cost of peas is Rs 15-20 per kg. There has been an increase in prices of other vegetables like potatoes and spinach. The winter season vegetables including cauliflower, cabbage and radish have also become costlier.Blaming inadequate supply for rising prices, Shyam, a vegetable vendor said, ""We are forced to raise the price of vegetables, as we are not getting vegetables from the wholesale market. There is less supply of vegetables during this winter as compared to last year."""
4,Veggie prices add to chill,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Veggie-prices-add-to-chill/articleshow/7233456.cms,2011-01-07,The Times Of India,"LUCKNOW: Vegetables seems to be the latest casualty of the biting winter chill. Even as the common man was trying to come to terms with the prices of onions and tomatoes, the escalating prices of other vegetables has furthered kitchen expenses.Vegetable vendors association blames winter chill for all vegetables other than onions. ""Vegetable prices seem to be directly proportional to winter chill,"" said Satish Sonkar, president of UP fruits and vegetables growers and sellers association.The reason? ""Wholesale vegetables markets are fed by supplies from the fields. But bad weather is not permitting farmers to venture out. So, the markets have to do with whatever little they get,"" said Sonkar. ""Shortage naturally triggers price rise,"" he added. Worse is, the price would rise further, if the conditions do not improve by the weekend.Farmers basically work in the field since morning. But during winters, their daily schedule start several hours after sunrise. Then there is fog, which further restricts their activities. ""When we get up, the fog is so dense that one cannot see anything. Plucking of vegetables is different from collecting other harvest. Since one cannot see properly, risk of loss due to wastage is higher, which keeps us away from the field,"" said Kanhaiya Lal, a farmer from Takrohi area.Weather restricting farmers from work causes shortage of vegetables in the supply-chain, which results in price rise. Take the example of brinjals, which are grown by vegetable farmers in and around Lucknow. The cost of one kilo brinjals on Thursday was Rs 8, which is twice the rate 10 days ago. ""In the beginning of 2010, brinjals costed Rs 2-3 per kilo in the whole sale market,"" said Radhey Pal, a vegetable wholesaler in Balaganj mandi.Price of peas, the king vegetable of this season, has however shown some consistency. The rate has remained in the Rs 14-16 bracket for the last 8-10 days.In fact, the cost is expected to come down a little by the next week. Cauliflower and potatoes have also kept the buyers happy. But all the leafy vegetables, cabbage, pumpkin, capsicum and carrots have disappointed.Rate of onions and tomatoes, which serve as the base material has however continued to bother the people. Against a rate of Rs 26-32 per kilo in wholesale market, onions touched the Rs 46 mark here on Thursday. Buyers picking vegetables from the city market shell at least Rs 10 more for a kilo of onion. Location of the retail market may cause a further addition. For instance, per kilo cost of onion in Kaiserbagh market was Rs 56 while that in Narhi market was Rs 60-62.Wholesalers association however clarified that price of onion did not alter because of weather conditions. ""Short supply is the chief reason,"" said Sonkar, who believes that hoarding by growers in Maharashtra was also to be blamed.""The crisis appears artificial to me,"" he said. To note, chief economic advisor to the Government of India, Kaushik Basu also blamed hoarding for high price of onions in the country.So, is there any relief in the offing? Sonkar said, ""Not at least in case of onions and tomatoes. Wedding season (starting January 15) is round the corner and the demand would see a sudden rise. Prior to that, if weather conditions do not improve in a day or two, vegetable prices would go up,"" said Sonkar."
5,Sin City – 10 things that make me drool,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Guilty-Pleasures/sin-city-10-things-that-make-me-drool/,2011-01-07,The Times Of India,"My friends say, you are not really a Mumbaikar until you have had vada pav with extra chutney that leaves your nose watering for half hour, had pav bhaji at one of the Western suburb stalls, where you either squat on the mattresses spread out on the footpath, or balance your plates on your car bonnet. You have to have Naturals sitaphal or tender coconut ice-cream and Luckys biryani, the succulent prawn and chicken fry at Jai Jawan on Linking Road and coffee form the all-night cycle wallahs. You have to suffer at least one bad tummy after Pancham Puriwalas potent puri, bhaji, sheera, and share your leftovers with the resident rodents and mongrels at the iconic Bade Miyas. The list could go on, and we have not even started on the propah restaurants with their pedigreed menus.Since it is that time of the year when lists of all kinds are hot, heres mine- all biased, skewed and completely subjective. My top ten food experiences, not in any particular order.1. Pani Puri. Every nukkad will have its reigning king of the tamarind water, with his special mix of choicest germs and mysterious spices. My hotlist has the guy opposite Mc Donalds in Fort, who sets up his table between 5 pm to 10 pm every day. Good news for phhuchka lovers, he mixes a mean aloo masala, just like home. In the suburbs, try the stall at KDs Lo Price in Seven Bungalows. He is relatively clean too, and that takes nothing away from the taste.2. Jai Hind (Lower Parel) for complete VFM fish and all forms of sea life. I just love their prawns, pomfret and bombil preps. And thier steaming hot patrani macchi with steamed rice will leave you incapacitated for any kind of work after that.3. Gajalees sea bass fry. With three different kinds of chutney. Onions. Dash of lime. Bliss.4. Indigo Cafs grilled prawns. Especially when it comes with mash with skin on. With a glass of wine (dont ask me what kind because I am not really the sorts who swirl and sniff and then sip), it makes for the perfect celebratory meal.5. Nimbu chicken from Urban Tadka/Masala Mantar. If you wanna know what the good chefs can do with chicken with green chilies, ginger and creamyou dont wanna miss this. Trust me. What makes it work time and again is the restaurants superb delivery system and the fact that they ply you with free jalebis with every order. God bless!6. My colleague Bapu Deedwanias lunch box. A lethal legal correspondent, who carries at least four dabbas with the most amazing vegetarian (mostly Rajasthani specialties) and non-vegetarian dishes. The other day I was rendered speechless by her mirchi vadi (stuffed whole green chillies batter fried). She had also managed to turn me into a red-meat eater with her potent mutton curry, with meat that melts in your spoon ever before you put it in your mouth.7. Aloo bhaja and mooger daal from Oh! Calcutta. Moong dal with green peas and crispy potato juliennes. Best had with steamed rice. It is home. It is delicious. And it serves at least three people. And most importantly, it is the one thing they have not changed on their menu.8. My friend Viveks Khao Shuay. On the rare occasion when he calls people over, no self-respecting foodie would wanna miss the experience. I am yet to taste Khao Shuay as flavourful, aromatic and beautifully presented as his. He even chops the peanuts uniformly!9. Peking Duck and Dim Sums at Royal China. It is a luxury that I can seldom afford. But when I can, I have this silly grin on my face for the rest of the day.10. And to end on a sweet note, Theobromas brownies (Bandra and Colaba), Moshes gooey chocolate cake (Kala Ghoda), Annapurnas mishti doi (New Bombay), Cinnabons with pecan nuts, Chocolate clairs from Birdys and waffles from Crepe Station with generous servings of nutella, fresh cream, maple syrup and nuts and donuts from Mad over Donuts with soft, creamy, vanilla filling.Special MentionSince I am feeling generous, and since it is criminal to try and reduce my food experience to simply 10 things, here are the ones who find an honorable mention:The cheese masala dosa from Khau Gully opposite BMC. If you have not stood there, jostling for elbow room and watched the man turn out dosa after dosa after uttapam after dosa tirelessly, if you have not eaten the piping hot, crispy gold and melted cheese dosas, you have been deprived of a truly enriching experience.Vada Pav with extra butter and grilled lightly, at Jumbo King. Forget the fancy plastic containers and use your fingers, open your mouth wide, bite in, close your eyes and thank me.Breakfast at Mc Donalds Panvel. Because it usually means you are going away for the weekend, because it means you dont really care about eating healthy for once, because you think hash brown potatoes and pancakes with syrup lure the child in you, you stop, pull over and queue up. Moments later, you are sitting in a crowded corner, your tray piled with goodies, and your mind telling you, the holidays just begun.Giant festive jalebis at most sweet shops . You have to see it to believe it  it is beautifully wound, gold and orange, spiced with cardamom and saffron and dripping with sinful sugar syrup. Each piece could last you an entire week. You can hit the treadmill after that."
6,Retail rates hitting most,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Retail-rates-hitting-most/articleshow/7233460.cms,2011-01-07,The Times Of India,"LUCKNOW: The final blow regarding vegetable prices comes from the retailers end. In the wholesale market, the potatoes were costing Rs 4 per kg on Thursday, and in the retail market, one had to shell out Rs 10 for the same quantity.Brinjals were costing Rs 7-8 per kg in the wholesale market, and Rs 15 per kg in the retail. The prices of peas, tomatoes and even onions varied considerably. Against a rate of Rs 16 per kg, peas were being sold at Rs 18-19 per kg in the retail market. Similarly, green leafy vegetables, especially spinach, were 20% to 30% costly in the retail market.Vendors and retailers admitted that they were charging high but defended their move. Santosh Kumar, who sells takes vegetables near Wala Qadar Road, said, ""We add cost of transportation and bringing the stuff at your door step.""Geeta Kashyap, who has a retail vegetable shop in Narahi, said, ""If you see the vegetables in the wholesale market and the way they are handled there, you will never buy them. We clean the vegetables before showcasing them."" The officials of Wholesaler Association, however, claimed that the prices of vegetables were up by 70%-80% in retail markets. ""Prices of vegetables vary from one retail centre to another. A market or vendor near the posh colony would have a higher cost than the one in an average area,"" said Satish Sonkar."
7,Hoarding pushes up prices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Hoarding-pushes-up-prices/articleshow/7238663.cms,2011-01-08,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA/HOOGHLY: Strange as it may sound, the upward swing in potato and onion prices is having a cascading effect on prices of other perishable items in the retail market. It is not merely the demand-supply gap that makes your daily dish dearer. Systematic hoarding' by powerful middlemen is hitting you hard. Common people are at the mercy of hoarders and middlemen, with the government having no control over the market.""Otherwise, there is no reason why seasonal vegetables like tomato, cauliflower and green peas or coriander leaves should be so costly,"" said Apurba Roy, an agriculture expert. On Wednesday, onion sold at Rs 60 a kg and potato Rs 15 a kg. It is not that there aren't genuine reasons like drought and flood behind the price rise. But personal greed is playing havoc with prices to such an extent that the burden of an honest living and staying healthy weighs heavily on a large number of citizens, Roy added.""The agriculture-marketing model prevailing in the state secures neither the interest of consumers nor that of farmers. Often middlemen create panic among farmers by spreading rumours about falling prices, forcing them to resort to distress sale of their crops. These crops then reach middlemen who hold sway over prices. The produce changes three to five hands in the chain of middlemen. The longer the chain, the dearer the commodity becomes to the eventual consumer. So in the process, both the grower and end-users suffer alike one getting lesser price against larger quantity of produce, the other receiving lesser products by paying through their noses,"" explained Roy.In this chain of middlemen, there are some big fish or phoreys who create huge stockpile of foodgrains and storable vegetables like potato, onion and ginger. These phoreys control the supply of the produces in the market and thus facilitate the price rise,"" Roy added. Take the case of onion the cartel of middlemen regulates the supply of onion to the retail or wholesale market. Since onions can be stored in the godown, these middlemen are taking full advantage of the opportunity. The middleman cartel is regulating the supply after stockpiling the state's share of onion.The roles of Benfed (West Bengal market Federation) and Confed (West Bengal Consumers' Federation) are murkier here. ""Instead of rescuing consumers, they mess up the whole thing. Last March, these federations had bought 9.8 lakh tonnes of potatoes. The objective was to bring down the potato price. But the potato reached the market as late as October, letting the price to rise at an extraordinary rate. But after it reached the market, people found the potato to be the inferior pokhraj' variety and not the jyoti' variety promised by the federations. So the bulk of the potato bought by these two government agencies remained unsold,"" revealed Akrur Sen, a consumer activist.In 2009, the farmers sold potato at `3 per kg. The price of potato in the retail market varied from Rs 7 to Rs 10 per kg. In 2010, farmers sold potato mostly at Rs 4 per kg, in some cases Rs 5 per kg, but the price of the same potato soared to Rs 25 per kg, despite including potato in the list of essential commodities and issuing a notification under the West Bengal Prevention of Hoarding of Essential Food Stuffs Order, 2009, declaring potatoes cannot be stocked beyond a permissible limit.Potato-grower Fulkumar Barui of Raskundu in West Midnapore sold the potato directly from his farmland after a rumour of falling potato price. Manas Roy, a middleman from Keyabani, was quick to buy the produce at Rs 40,000 per 10 tonne. ""I could barely manage to have a marginal profit. I get really hurt when I am buying potato at Rs 14 per kg for my household,"" said Fulkumar Barui.Patit Paban De, former president of West Bengal Cold Storage Owners' Association, said: ""The government is supposed to monitor every stage of the agriculture-chain. But it miserably failed to do that, allowing some unscrupulous phoreys to reign supreme."" For instance, Manas Roy got a price of Rs 1.8 lakh to Rs 2 lakh per 10 tonne at the end of last season when he brought the potato out of the cold-storage. ""So finally I got a price of Rs 9 to Rs 10 per kg,"" he smiled. Roy is nonchalant about the plight of common people. ""Tell me, the price of which item is going down,"" he asked instead. Roy was quick to add that he had to bear the cost of cold-storage charge which varies from Rs 8,500 to 9,000, transportation cost of Rs 2,000 and 5% for the rotten crops.Samir Das, a middleman, who made a fortune out of hoarding, claimed himself to be the saviour of small farmers. ""Because of us, these small farmers survive. We rescue them when they have a capital crunch. Otherwise, they could neither repay the loan, nor could they get a fresh loan next year. So it is no point blaming us for the price hike. We have come here to do business, not charity.""But the speculative pricing or fatkabaji' is at its peak in the potato market. Last Sunday, the wholesale price was Rs 610 per 50 kg packet, on Wednesday it came down to Rs 595. But that hardly reflected in the retail market."
8,‘Agrarian question linked to Dalit discrimination',http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lsquoAgrarian-question-linked-to-Dalit-discrimination/article15510975.ece,2011-01-08,The Hindu,"Participants at a national seminar on Dalit households in village economies,' which began here on Friday, affirmed that a lasting solution to India's agrarian question  characterised by extreme inequalities in the distribution of land  was inseparably linked to the widespread discrimination of Dalits.Speaking at the inaugural session of the two-day event, Abhijit Sen, Member, Planning Commission, said the tradition of village studies in India had a rich lineage and pedigree which had died down somewhat during the 1980s and the 90s.Professor Sen said that about 50 such surveys conducted in the last seven to eight years, by adopting methodologies generally used by larger sample surveys conducted by official agencies, had enabled the testing and extrapolation of data.These village surveys, unlike the sample surveys, enable researchers to study the relationships among different social groups, he said. It is almost in the pedigree of village studies that they enable the study of caste relations in the field of agrarian studies.Introducing the theme, V.K. Ramachandran, Professor at the Sociological Research Unit, Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, said: The objective is to study the specific ways in which the economic discrimination of Dalits  in market and non-market forms  happens.He pointed out that the team of researchers, with whom he has been associated, has conducted more than 30 village surveys since the 1990s to study direct discrimination as well as forms of discrimination that cause differential impacts across social groups.Linking the agrarian question to the annihilation of caste is an important research agenda, Professor Ramachandran said. Rigorous micro-studies of the victims of sectional discrimination, relating to exclusion from land, employment, credit, and other inputs are needed.Referring to the contention in some quarters that since markets are blind, they may provide salvation to Dalits, Professor Ramachandran said: Existing forms of discrimination reinforce relationships based on the market.Judith Heyer from Oxford University, who presented results from a series of surveys of villages near Coimbatore and Tirupur since the early 1980s, pointed out that although the material conditions of Dalits in the area had improved considerably, their position relative to the dominant castes had not improved significantly.The mini industrial revolution in the area has not resulted in the dominant castes loosening their grip over the economy, she said.V. Surjit, agricultural economist at the International Potato Centre, New Delhi, who presented a study of a village in the tail-end of the Cauvery delta region, said that although Dalits had been able to gain access to land as tenants, they were targets of discriminatory economic practices.His study showed that Dalit tenants had to incur higher costs of cultivation on account of higher rents and higher cost of hiring pumpsets and other machinery used in agricultural operations."
9,Closed mandi adds to woes,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ludhiana/closed-mandi-adds-to-woes/,2011-01-08,Indian Express,"While Pakistans refusal to allow export of onion through land route has escalated the rates of the crop nationwide,the situation has worsened here further due to closure of the whole sale vegetable market which is reeling under the ongoing Income tax raids. The IT raids continued for the second day on Friday. These raids are being conducted on various vegetable commission agents.It has been learnt that the IT department has been able to recover Rs 7.5 crores from whole sale merchants who made quick moolah by selling onions at exhorbitant rates. The Department knew that the traders hads minted high profits due to high prices of the vegetables especially onion,thus these raids were conducted to check the tax amount evasion. We have conducted raids at two vegetable merchants in Amritsar,Two at Ludhiana and one at Jalandhar,said RK Goel,Director (Investigation) Income tax Department.The firms of Amritsar has surrendered Rs. 4.5 crores as most of them were dealing with the onion which was imported from Pakistan through Wagah international border,while the Rs. 2.5 crore was surrender by a merchant to IT department team which raided at Janaldhar. In Ludhiana,Rs.1.25 crores has been surrendered by two traders,said Goel.He said that the department has seized the documents and also checking that whether the traders are indulging in the hoarding or not. He said that the final tax would be calculated after the final submission of report by the Investigation team.Meanwhile one such whole seller who did not want be named informed,The rate of onions in the mandis is just Rs 40 a kg and this is the price of a very good quality onion. But due to these raids we are not working and hence the rates in the retail market have shot up. To be honest these IT raids have forced the whole sale merchants dealing mainly in onion and potato to sit back.Adding to this another merchant informed,If the mandis do not open by tomorrow the prices of onions are going to hit the roof. The price of this crop in the retail market will cross Rs 80. The basic truth is that we wholesalers are not charging extra for the crop,instead it is the retailers who are fleecing the general public. We sell this vegetable for Rs 40 or let us say Rs 50 a kg. The retailer sells it for Rs 70 or Rs 80 then who is to be blamed.Countering this Mukesh Kumar a retail vegetable vendor in Ghumar Mandi said:  I am buying onions for Rs 70 a kg and after including the transportation cost and all a Rs 10 hike is genuine. When told that the whole price is around Rs 40 this vegetable vendor refused to buy this rate claiming, this is not true.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
10,Pongal bazaar offers products at lower rates,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Pongal-bazaar-offers-products-at-lower-rates/article15513824.ece,2011-01-10,The Hindu,"The 17 {+t} {+h} edition of the annual Pongal bazaar organised by the Puducherry Agro-Products, Food and Civil Supplies Organisation (PAPSCO), is expected to make a total sale of over Rs. 40 lakh this year.According to Managing Director of PAPSCO Vasantha Kumar, the nine-day bazaar, inaugurated by Chief Minister V. Vaithilingam on Friday, is a market intervention activity by the government to provide a respite to consumers from high prices that prevail in the open market during the festival.The bazaar provides consumers with a variety of products, including vegetables, groceries, textiles, sugarcane and others, which are in great demand during the season. The self-service mode followed in the bazaar helps consumers spend more time and choose products of their choice.Last year, the bazaar netted a total sale of Rs. 35 lakh, with sugarcane sale alone earning Rs. 3.5 lakh. The contribution of sugarcane to this year's sales is expected to touch Rs. 5 lakh. Mr. Kumar said sugarcane has been directly procured from farmers from Thanjavur and Mannargudi and are sold at Rs. 12.50 a cane.The bazaar offers more than 28 varieties of rice and all varieties of pulses at rates lower than the market. Shirts, saris and dhotis are also offered at a discount.Though the bazaar offers products at lower prices, consumers said they see a marked increase in the rates when compared to prices during the Deepavali bazaar put up by PAPSCO.According to H. Geetha, a housewife, the soaring prices of pulses and vegetables has had an adverse impact on her spending for the festival. We usually buy good clothes and prepare a variety of sweets for pongal.' However, with price of products such as ghee and vegetables soaring, we are cutting down expenditure considerably, she said.On Sunday, the price of a kg of onion was Rs. 61. Other vegetables also saw a slight increase in rates with tomatoes being sold at Rs. 25 per kg and carrot Rs. 31 a kg. Consumers said that season specific vegetables such as yam and sweet potato have also seen considerable increase in prices."

A serious step in this regard had to be taken as we were not at fault,"" he said.The traders' decision of not dealing in onions would mean that the acute shortage of onions will take place in the Industrial City.As a result, the price of onions is set to increase again.At present, the onion is available between Rs 30-35 per kg in the wholesale market, and for Rs 40-45 per kg in retail markets.Now it is to be seen that at what price will onions be available in the market in the days to come.On the first day of the week, only six onion-laden trucks had reached Chakarpur Sabzi Mandi. The Industrial City receives an average of 60 to 70 trucks in the Chakarpur Sabzi Mandi on normal days."
12,Price rise: Chidambaram questions Pawar on sugar exports,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Price-rise-Chidambaram-questions-Pawar-on-sugar-exports/articleshow/7263347.cms,2011-01-12,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Differences within the ruling government alliance over food management came to the fore on Tuesday with home minister P Chidambaram questioning agriculture minister Sharad Pawar's pitch for resuming export of sugar.A meeting convened by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss measures to calm soaring food prices saw sugar become a key focus area with Pawar plumping for freeing its export, citing an expected bumper crop this year.As soon as Pawar raised the issue, Chidambaram retorted by saying that there was no need to make fresh commitments when there were unfulfilled export obligations. The home minister had last week raised doubts about the way food inflation was being tackled and wondered if the government had the tools to tackle the menace.Sources present at the meeting said Pawar had to back down and the matter was referred to a ministerial panel. They said that the government is worried over rising food inflation, which hit 18.3% in the last week of December, and was changing course in view of a global supply crunch for sugar. It had earlier indicated that sugar exports would resume in February but the recent spike in food prices has led to second thoughts.There was also discussion on banning futures trading in farm commodities, including sugar, but the PM and his close aides on Tuesday opted for status quo. The recent spike due to rising fruit and vegetable prices, where no futures trading is allowed at present, was a factor that weighed in favour of continuing with futures trading. Potato futures are an exception, but retail prices of potato have actually dipped due to improved supplies.Faced with a limited set of options to beat back inflation in view of growing demand-supply gaps, the government has fallen back on short-term measures like cracking down on middlemen in vegetable markets to contain price rise. However, it realizes that such crackdowns too can prove counter-productive, as proved by the recent income tax raids on onion traders.Some immediate measures to reduce the intermediation cost in vegetables are being considered. ""It is not just onion prices, sharp increases in vegetable rates are a serious matter. There are many layers of middlemen in the market,"" a source said.The cabinet secretary has been asked to draw up a note detailing the action plan which will be circulated to the PM and senior ministers and the deputy chairman of the planning commission. Proposals that will be drawn up would be considered by the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA).The assessments offered at Tuesday's meeting show the government is dealing with a limited set of price control options. Presentations pointed to critical food production and demand gaps, suggesting few alternatives to living with inflation. Prices could moderate but inflationary pressures would remain."

However, mounting search and seizure operations on the pretext that traders were responsible for spiralling prices is not right. The prices won't come down by conducting such raids, Mr. Lahoti said.Mr. Balakrishna noted that the spiralling prices of food products, including onion, only exhibited the failure of the Government to foresee the availability of produce before allowing their export.

However, without realising this, it allowed export of produce, resulting in their shortage in the domestic market, he said."
25,FM taps states to tame prices ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110115/jsp/business/story_13443781.jsp,2011-01-15,Telegraph,"World Bank president Robert B. Zoellick (right) with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Friday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar New Delhi, Jan. 14: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has called a meeting of state finance ministers on January 19 to discuss measures against inflation, which rose to an unacceptably high level of 8.43 per cent in December. Food inflation at this level is not acceptable and we are trying our best to control it with the co-operation of state governments, Mukherjee told reporters here. The World Bank today attributed the high inflation to supply deficiencies and assured support to improve agriculture productivity, which should stabilise food prices. My own sense in the case of the Indian economy is that some of the inflationary pressures are more likely a function of some of the bottlenecks on the supply side than they are from the demand side, World Bank president Robert B. Zoellick said at a joint press conference with Mukherjee. Costlier food items  mainly onions and vegetables  have pushed overall wholesale inflation to 8.43 per cent in December from 7.48 per cent in the previous month. During the meeting with state finance ministers, Mukherjee is expected to ask them to exempt horticulture items from the Agriculture Produce Market Committee Act. The act prevents farmers from selling their produce directly in the market and is possibly responsible for the huge differences in the mandi rates of onion, fruits and vegetables and those quoted by farmers. The act issues licences to select traders and perpetuates their monopoly. The finance minister may also ask states to waive local taxes such as mandi tax, octroi and other levies on essential commodities. The contribution of food prices to overall inflation could be gauged from the fact that manufactured inflation came down to 4.46 per cent in December from 4.56 per cent in the previous month. It is mainly vegetable prices that have risen during the month. Vegetable prices rose 22.90 per cent in December compared with the previous month. Within vegetables, onions turned expensive by 34.86 per cent and potato by 16.29 per cent. Analysts believe the RBI may raise its rates at its policy meet on January 25 to prevent food inflation spilling over to the rest of the economy. Food secretary B.C. Gupta said the government had sufficient wheat and rice stocks and might allocate more wheat to bulk consumers such as flour millers. We have enough stock of wheat and rice. We are open to allocate more wheat to bulk consumers, he said."

This is a continuing battle, Mr. Mukherjee said.As for the steps that the RBI is expected to put in place, Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council Chairman C. Rangarajan economic panel favoured some tightening' of money supply by the apex bank. The inflation rate for December has turned out to be much higher than what was originally expected... Given the present situation, perhaps some tightening on the part of the Reserve Bank may be required, he said."

Apart from Pune and the adjacent districts, the Pune market also receives supply from north Karnataka. There are number of farmers who prefer to supply vegetables to Pune over Bangalore.""Compared to leafy vegetables like spinach and fenugreek, the price of vegetables like lady finger, cabbage and brinjal remained high. The period of maturity of these vegetables is longer, which sometimes affects the supply. It results in prices remaining on the higher side, whereas leafy vegetables, which can be grown in kitchen gardens as well, are available at very affordable prices.The price of onion, which was hovering around Rs 70 per kg last Sunday, came down to Rs 50 per kg later in the week and has stabilised at that level. Baby onions are available in the price range of Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kg. Cauliflower and cabbage prices are hovering around Rs 14 and Rs 18 per kg respectively in various parts of the city. Earlier, the prices were above Rs 30 and Rs 60 per kg in the retail market. Brinjal and potato prices are around Rs 32 and Rs 16 per kg respectively.Leafy vegetables are more affordable with a single-digit price tag. Spinach and fenugreek bunches are available for Rs 5 in the retail market. Agricultural production improved with harvesting activity for onion, leafy vegetables and some cereals beginning in the second week of November, when rainfall stopped completely.Though the supply has increased and the prices were reasonable, it will not reflect in the farmer's earnings, according to market experts. Some vegetables are getting costlier because of the increased transportation cost.Though it is bought at the farm at cheaper rate, the increased price of petrol and diesel are also adding to the costs in the retail market.Metro cities will face the heat more as most of the supply to Pune comes from places at least 50 kg away from the city, hence the transportation cost is likely to be added in the prices of vegetables, said a commission agent at Market Yard."

Struggling to feed a child for as less as 70 paise a day, the meal-makers have taken off costly onions and potatoes from the plates and often cabbages and chow chow form the staple.With prices of vegetables hitting the roof and fuel and groceries becoming costlier, noon-meal organisers across the state are finding it increasingly difficult to work within the measly budget provided by the government.""Given the current rate of inflation, it is impossible to work within this budget. We asked the goverment to sanction Rs 100 per day for 100 children but our demand has been turned down. Given the current rate of inflation, we need at least Rs 3 per day per child,"" said T R Meghanthan, general secretary of the Mid-Day Meals Worker's Association.He said there are times when mid-day meal workers at various schools shelled out money from their own pockets to provide children with vegetables. ""We have also been asked to provide potatoes to the children and to procure it at the rate of Rs 8 per kilo, which is ridiculous. Potatoes are much costlier now,"" he said. Speaking about the allocation for fuel, he said Rs 24 per day for 100 children was very low and it was not possible to cook 10 kilos of rice, boil 100 eggs and also make sambhar for 100 children within that budget with the increase in fuel prices.With their prices skyrocketting, vegetables like tomatoes, onions, carrots, beans and drumsticks have vanished from the plates of the children. ""Because of the high costs, we are opting for cheaper vegetables like cabbage, radish and beetroot,"" said G Alphonso Ammal, the noon-meal organiser at Chennai High School in Adyar. She said the government had increased the daily allocation per child from 44 paisa in September 2010 to 70 paisa in October. Of this, 32 paisa is for vegetables, 14 paisa for groceries and 24 paisa for fuel.""We have been feeding the children cabbage and radish sambhar all week now. A cut of spinach, a cheap vegetable, costs Rs 15 now. It has become impossible to buy other vegetables with the money given to us,"" said R Amrithavalli, the noon-meal organiser at a government school in Saidapet.Social welfare minster P Geetha Jeevan said the quantity of food being provided to the children had not been reduced. ""We are still giving five eggs a week to all children and the same quantity of rice and dal like before. We are giving them locally-available vegetables which are cheaper."" she said. Speaking about the allocation per child, she said that shooting prices was a temporary phenomenon which happened only during festival times and it was possible to adjust within the 80 paisa budget allocated by the government.""We give only the best and most nutritious food to the children. It is not feasible to increase the allocation to Rs 3 per day per child. Whatever we give will not be satisfactory for the noon-meal organisers,"" the minister said."

To control the price rise, the Centre asked state governments to remove supply side bottlenecks. Vegetable prices, however, continued to remain firm going up by 65.39 per cent over the same period last year. Onion prices doubled during the year.While fruits became expensive by 15.91 per cent, prices of milk rose by 13.27 per cent and egg, meat and fish by 12.94 per cent.

""We shall have to watch the situation. All necessary effective steps are being taken including improving of supply management,"" Mukherjee said. Analysts said food inflation is now on a declining trajectory and felt it would come down to single digit by mid-February.""I expect similar kind of a decline in food inflation next week. By mid-February it will be back in single digits,"" ICRA Economist Aditi Nayar said. Analysts also expect the Reserve Bank to undertake a 25 basis points rate hike during the January 25 policy review meeting. Yesterday at a meeting with the state finance ministers, Mukherjee had asked them to remove local levies like octroi and mandi tax to bridge the gap between farmgate and retail prices.The states, however, asked the centre to reduce duties on crude oil and petroleum products to tame prices."

Thanks to a bumper potato production, vegetable prices have crashed by up to 50 per cent. Over the past fortnight, prices of potatoes plunged by 60-70 per cent in retail markets.The prices were hovering at Rs 20 to Rs 25 per kg about a month ago, and now have come down to Rs 7 to Rs 8 per kg.Market players attribute the fall in potato prices to high production and inadequate cold-storage capacity. A further fall is expected by next month and potatoes could be available for merely Rs 4 per kg in retail markets.""The price slide has happened because of improved supply from upcountry and local farmers. Much depends on local production,"" said Kishore Parihar, a wholesale dealer.Potato growers, mainly from Deesa, Palanpur, Himmatnagar and Dahegam in North Gujarat, are optimistic about recovering heavy losses incurred in 2008.The director of research of the Sardar Patel Dantiwada Agricultural University (SDAU), SBS Tikka, said: ""We expect a bumper potato crop which could lead to a further fall in prices. And the arrival of the Sanga type of potato in the market has begun. We feel all cold-storage facilities will be quickly filled up this time.""A farmer from Athamanavas Ranpura, Ramesh Thanasi Mali, said: ""Many farmers in north Gujarat, the largest potato growing region of the state, had queued up at cold storages in 2008, but could find no space.""Usually in February and March, prices of potatoes crash and so do the rates of even cauliflower, cabbage and other vegetables, said Bhagwan Dasani, a wholesaler in Mehsana."

It spreads natural freshness all around their residence on the fifth floor of an apartment on SP Verma Road.""For apartment residents who love gardening, terrace greening is quite a satisfying and productive preoccupation,"" Asha Singh told TOI.This prized possession of the Singhs did not come up overnight. The couple has been tending the flora on the terrace of their private residence since 1996. ""We then lived in our official bungalow but we would visit the apartment every weekend to nurture the flowers,"" Justice Singh said and added now that he has retired, the rooftop gardening has become his full-time engagement.There's a rare plant in the Singhs' garden. Called 'Yesterday-Today-Tomorrow', the flower's pink shade changes every day. Their green collections include red guava, stevia (whose leaves can be used as a sugar substitute), vermillion, Chinese orange, devil's thorn, fireball, poinsettia, Hawaiian lily, lavender, 'basmati', 'harsingar', calendula, 'amla', 'aprajita', pomegranate and lemon. Many of these the Singhs brought from places like Andaman, Ooty, Chennai and Bangalore.Rooftop gardens need extra care as the plants are more exposed to direct sunlight, strong winds and severe cold. An overhead shade is a must to protect the plants from perishing. ""During the rains, we bring all the plants inside the house,"" Asha Singh said.No less devoted have Manoranjan and Chandrakanta Sinha been to the garden on the terrace of their apartment on East Boring Canal Road.

37,"Farmers sow cash crops, reap losses",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Farmers-sow-cash-crops-reap-losses/articleshow/7345013.cms,2011-01-23,The Times Of India,"LUCKNOW: Like all other farmers in his village, Gabaddu, a 45-year-old small farmer in Magra Mau, has also planted wheat and oil seeds this winter in his 5 bigha land. He hopes to get a good yield because weather has been kind so far. But his major worry is skyrocketing prices of vegetables and pulses. ""Earlier, the village was self-sufficient as people used to grow different crops and vegetables. But now everyone follows the trend which is sure to get them good returns. As a result, farmers have to buy food grains and vegetables, other than those they have sown, from the open market. Hence, even if we get good return of our produce, the inflation nullifies it,"" said Gabaddu, who has to feed a family of nine, including a wife, parents, siblings and three children.The situation in Magra Mau reflects the macro picture of the change in the agriculture cropping pattern of UP. Of the 17 crore population in the state, more than 60% depend on agriculture with over 165 lakh hectare area under cultivation.In the past 15 years, farmers have moved towards cash crops like sugarcane, wheat, rice, potato and mustard, while turning away from pulses, coarse grains and sweet potatoes. Consequently, production of sugarcane has increased by 30%, potato 50%, oil seeds 25%, wheat 20% and rice 20% in comparison to output in mid-90s but, that of coarse grain, pulses and other crops has come down by 20%-50%. Among pulses, production of Arhar alone dropped to 3.25 lakh tonne in 2008-09 from 4.56 lakh tonne in 2001-02.The changes have been due to irrigation facilities, geographical locations, prices, nature of soil, availability of road network and storage capacity. Nearly 70% of agriculture land in UP is irrigated through tubewells, 5% through canals and remaining is rain-fed. In the Terai and west UP where irrigation facilities are adequate, farmers prefer water-intensive crops like cane and paddy. Wheat, paddy and oil seeds are more popular in central and east UP. The drought-prone Bundelkhand region depends on less water requiring crops like coarse grain and pulses. If better road network has helped farmers opt for cane and wheat as it has made transportation easier today, the availability of more cold storages has made farmers to go for perishable crops like potato.Today, farmers follow what others in their area do. ""It is easier because when everybody is on the same boat, we can depend on each other for advice. Also, it's easy to find a market because traders know where they can get a particular crop in bulk,"" said Roshan, another farmer in Daheli village. ""But there is also a risk. If potato gets more price this year, all farmers in a village go for potato cultivation for the next year leading to a glut resulting in fall in prices and huge loss. Storage facilities are also not as per the demand. As a result, farmers are forced to sell produce at a loss as they need to vacate fields for the next sowing. Small and marginal farmers suffer the most,"" he said.However, a change in the cropping pattern has also made UP top producer of sugarcane, wheat, paddy and vegetable in the country. UP's agri growth rate has increased from 2.10% in 10th plan to 5% in 11th five year plan, mainly due to growth in horticulture, livestock, fisheries and poultry farming.The vegetable production has also increased from 13.5 million tonne in 2000 to 15 million tonne in 2008. If Lucknow and Sultanpur have emerged as major mango exporters, Agra zone has become potato exporter, Banana is being produced at a largescale in Bahraich and mint in Barabanki. ""Agriculture productivity has increased but the change in cropping pattern has been done in an unplanned manner,"" said Prof Sudhir Kumar, president, Kisan Jagriti Manch.""Cropping pattern should be based on the assessment of the future demand by the government. Otherwise, what happens is that in the year when there is a glut of a particular crop, farmers suffer because prices fall and when there is shortage, consumers suffer due to rise in price. But in both the conditions middlemen and traders make profit,"" he said."
38,A turn to wholesale and co-operative outlets,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/A-turn-to-wholesale-and-co-operative-outlets/article15531004.ece,2011-01-24,The Hindu,"CHEAPER OPTIONS: With the rising prices of vegetables, many families are shopping at wholesale markets (left) and co-operative society outlets.  PhotoS: K.PichumaniThe last few months have seen a steep increase in the prices of essential commodities, particularly vegetables. The pressure has pushed consumers to find new ways to cut costs and choose cheaper alternatives.The patronage for outlets of cooperative societies in the city and Uzhavar Sandhais' in the suburbs seem to be increasing considerably, if the sales at these counters are any indication.Consumers are carefully weighing-in different options before choosing the most pocket-friendly alternative. For instance, the price difference between vegetables in the regular retail market and those available at counters of Cooperative Societies is about Rs.15.P. Balambigai, who was shopping at the Kilpauk outlet of the Triplicane Urban Cooperative Society (TUCS), says: I see a significant difference in onion prices. It is much cheaper here. Onions are priced at Rs.60 a kg outside, but here, I it for Rs. 45 a kg.The school teacher adds that with the prices of several commodities increasing by the day, even a seemingly small saving makes a big difference. TUCS outlets currently sell tomatoes, potato, broad beans, green chillies, cabbage, beans, carrot, plantain (or any other country vegetable).Swaran Singh, Secretary to the Co-operation, Food and Consumer Protection Department, says that following the review meeting chaired by Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi recently, several measures are being taken up to ensure commodities are available at affordable prices.The Amudham Departmental Store chain, being run in about 20 places in the city by The Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation, has been selling vegetables since November and the sale is picking up fast, according to Mr. Singh.Earlier, the outlets would stock about 2 kg of vegetables for a day, but now, nearly 15 kg of staple vegetables, including onions, potatoes and tomatoes are being sold at each of the outlets.Pointing to an over-30 per cent-increase in sale of vegetables in TUCS counters since November, R.G. Sakthisaravanan, joint registrar and special officer, TUCS, says the lower prices of vegetables in cooperative society outlets is also drawing customers to other commodities in the store, which are offered also at competitive prices.Consumers' tendency to prefer outlets such as these to the retail markets is possibly due to the prevalent high rates, and the lack of uniformity in pricing or quality. The prices of vegetables at retail markets are not going to climb down as quickly as they do in the wholesale market, according to wholesalers.S. Chandran, secretary, Koyambedu Periyar Market Licensed Merchants' Association, says: As we deal with perishable items, we increase the price when the arrivals are low and reduce the prices when the arrivals are moreBut a retailer is not under such a pressure. A retailer who buys 100 kg of a vegetable from us will continue to do so even when the price increases. His customers are steady and hence the price in the retail market will also remain high for sometime, Mr. Chandran adds.The prices of carrots at the Koyambedu wholesale market on Sunday was Rs.12 per kg, while it was Rs.28 at T. Nagar retail market. One kg of brinjal, which was available for Rs. 6 in Koyambedu, cost Rs. 10 in T. Nagar. Ladies finger, priced at Rs.15 per kg in Koyambedu was available for Rs.30 per kg in the retail market. One kg of beans cost Rs.25 and Rs.28 at the wholesale and retail markets respectively.Wholesale marketsNo wonder a good number professionals of the salaried class think that a visit to wholesale markets is worth it, despite the distance.Bala Murali, a resident of Porur and working with an NGO, says that he shops twice a month from Koyambedu wholesale market and stocks vegetables, as it is still a better option than paying double the price at the retail chains.G. Jayakumar, an employee of Standard Chartered, also agrees. I stay in Saidapet and the distance to come to the market is around 8 km but the quantity we purchase is enough to last two weeks.Uma Maheshwari, an employee of Cognizant, is more concerned about feeding her pet  a guinea pig.It only feeds on vegetables and fruits and shopping from the retail markets will cost me twice the price I pay here, says the Velachery resident, shopping at Koyambedu wholesale market.While retail markets and chains are not popular among consumers, vendors have their share of problems. A. Ramalingam, who retails in greens in the T. Nagar market, says finding agricultural labourers has become a challenge. We need persons below 45 years of age for agricultural work but what we get is only elderly persons who are not of much use, Mr. Ramalingam adds.N. Selvam, a retailer in vegetables in T. Nagar says the recent spells of rain had ensured that there would be enough vegetables soon but we need more casual labourers to pick the ripe vegetables, he says.Health is an aspect that tends to get ignored in such situations, fear some. Nutritionists say fruits and vegetables are perishable items, so it is all about smart planning when one buys in bulk. There is nothing like buying and eating fresh but due to such urban issues you have to go with it. Things change and there is nothing like cooking fresh from your kitchen garden, says Dharini Krishnan, former president of Indian Dietetic Association.(With inputs fromR.

There is over 20% increase in the yield of potatoes as compared to last year, which has created glut in some mandis.Nafai Singh, a farmer from Umri village, said his crop earned him only Rs 29,000 while it had cost him about Rs 30,000 including seeds, fertilizers and other inputs. This is because the price of potatoes in mandi this year has declined to Rs 185 per quintal as compared to Rs 450 per quintal last year.Kurukshetra district horticulture officer Mahinder Singh said farmers had earned good income from the early maturing crop in the month of November-December, but January crop is not fetching good price. He said glut was fallout of good crop all over Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana. He advised the farmers to store the crop in the cold storage and sell whenever the prices pick up.While the farmers are at the receiving end, the traders are also shying away from investing in this crop. Haryana Cold Storage Association vice-president Kuldeep Kakkar, who is also a famous potato grower, said prices of potatoes had dropped following reports from Ahmedabad, UP and Bengal that yield of potatoes this year was on higher side.He said potato is a perishable crop and so it is risky to trade. Last year, the purchasing rate of potato to store during January-February was Rs 450 per quintal, but at the end of season in October-November, it was sold at Rs 300 per quintal.Kakkar said if the government did not allow timely export of potatoes to Pakistan or any neighbouring country now, things would turn out to be like the ones that prevailed in the year 1997. Back then, the farmers and traders refused to take back their crop from the cold-storages as the price at that time was less than the storage charges, and the cold storage owners had to dump the stocks in pits.The potato growers in Punjab and Haryana earlier used to alternate onion and potato crops, but for the last few years farmers have started growing sunflower after harvesting potato crop, due to which onion production has considerably declined in this area. Puran Singh, a farmer, said they have seen that whenever the farmers lose money in potato crop they used to get good earning through onion crop. But now most of the farmers had shifted to sunflower as it needs less input and efforts as compared to onion crop."

41,Thin edge of the veg,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/jugglebandhi/if-we-can-t-afford-to-buy-onions-perhaps-it-s-time-to-grow-our-own/,2011-01-25,The Times Of India,"Do our experts know their onions? Speaking about the steep rise in the price of vegetables, particularly onions, and what to do about it, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, made the suggestion that farmers should be allowed to sell their produce to the best intermediary who will give them and the consumers the best price. Helpful advice, though more than a little obvious. Like saying that a circle should be allowed to be round in shape.Of course farmers should be enabled so that they can sell what they grow to the person who gives them the best price, thus incentivising them to grow more, instead of being forced to sell their produce for a pittance to rapacious middlemen who currently control the mandis and jack up food prices at will at the expense of the consumer. Its an obvious problem, with an obvious solution: permit foreign chains like Tesco  who have perfected the technique of bulk buying and bulk selling  to set up shop in India. In countries where such chains exist, food prices remain relatively stable, thanks to the competition between rival supermarket organisations.As obvious as this solution is, it is ruled out because of political opposition  mainly by the BJP and the Left, who for once are on the same side of the ideological divide  to foreign direct investment in the retail business. We cant let these exploitative foreigners in because they might rob us. So much better instead that we let ourselves be robbed by our own monopoly of exploitative middlemen. Keep it in the family, so to speak.Another suggestion, made by the agriculture ministry, is to have vegetable farm clusters located within a 50 km radius of all large towns and cities. Not a very practicable solution, considering the escalating price of real estate on the growing periphery of urban India where mixed-use residential-cum-commercial townships are springing up every day. To make it economically attractive to reserve such sought-after real estate for vegetable farming, the price of onions would have to be R 1,000 a kg, or more.So much for expert advice on how to bring down the price of veggies. Perhaps what we need now is some inexpert advice. As always, the most inexpert advice is the simplest. And in this case it amounts to a simple proposition: if we cant afford to buy sabzi from others, lets grow our own. All municipal parks, gardens, maidans and other open spaces, all over the country, should be put under veggie cultivation. Who needs grass when you can have gobhis instead, or chrysanthemums when you can have cabbages? To set an example for the nation to follow, Rashtrapati Bhavan should lead the way by turning its Mughal Gardens into a sabzi patch, with the president awarding, in a televised ceremony, a special prize to the mali who could produce the biggest mooli or kaddu.Lawns attached to private homes should by law be put under vegetable cultivation. Dont have a house with a lawn, but just a pokey little flat, and rented at that? No problem. You too can do your bit for the cause of ensuring the nations veggie security. Grow potatoes and tomatoes instead of flowers in the paudhas perched on your window sill.Inflation, of any kind, is a self-fulfilling condition based as it is not just on shortages but on the expectation of continuing, and worsening, shortages. If something is more costly today than it was yesterday, it will be costlier tomorrow than it is today. Such reasoning leads to hoarding, and creates further shortages. But with everyone growing their own the spectre of veggie shortages will forever be exorcised.We need a symbol for this new Green Revolution. Jawaharlal Nehru made the rose he wore in his lapel the symbol of his India. Maybe Rahul should start sporting a pyaaz on his lapel."

Thereafter, they started dipping and reached a level of Rs. 3 per kg. But now as the harvesting has started, the rates have again come down, they said.Potato growers have ascribed the steep decline in prices to bumper crop in Punjab and other key potato growing States including West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.Even as States like West Bengal, Gujarat and Karnataka brought down the area under cultivation, the yield of the crop is expected to be better because of weather conditions remaining conducive for the potato crop during the entire season, leading to bumper output of potato. As a result of it, the prices have come down sharply, Jalandhar Potato Growers' Association general secretary Jaswinder Singh told PTI.Potato growers however pointed out the prevailing rates do not even cover their total cost.Our total cost including input, transportation involved in potato worked out at Rs. 3 a kg while current rates are ruling lower than that, said a farmer who grows crop on his own land.The problems for big potato growers, who cultivate crop at leased land, are further compounded by the fact that they were losing out over Rs. 3 per kg on potato crop at current rates.Our break-even is at Rs 6 per kg because of large cost involved in getting land on lease and quality input, said Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers president Sukhjit Singh Bhatti.Even Punjab Agricultural University in its latest report has predicted low rate of potato crop at Rs 2.5 to 3 per kg in next two months.Seeking intervention of State Government, potato growers have demanded introduction of freight subsidy on transportation of crop for export and other states.The Punjab Government in 2009 had announced freight subsidy of Rs. 400 per tonne for purposes of marketing of potatoes within country and Rs 1,500 per tonne for export.Punjab this season grew potato in an area of 84,000 hectares and expects an output of 22 lakh tonne. Punjab has almost five to seven per cent share in country's total potato production.It mainly grows varieties of Pukhraj, Jyoti, Kufri Chandramukhi, Kufri Bahar and Kufri Ashoka. - PTI"

Carrots were being sold at Rs 30 a kg.V Soundarajan, market advisor to Onion and Potato Wholesale Traders Association in Koyambedu, said, ""With the sun shining strong post-Pongal, the fields are beginning to dry up and many vegetable crops have been salvaged. Also, the second crop in Maharashtra from areas like Ahmednagar, Sholapur and Paltan has already hit the markets.""He added that the prices were likely to stabilize now. ""There is a good chance that prices will remain at these low rates for the next few months until the heat begins,"" he said. ""Then again, the prices will shoot up. This is also the time when a lot of green leafy vegetables arrive in the market."" Unlike fuel, if vegetable prices rise, they also fall, pointed out Soundarajan.

Praising the efforts being made by the farmers to meet the food requirements of 106 crore population of the country, the Union minister said that despite the fact 80% of the farmers possess land area less than five acres each and 60% lack water supply resources for irrigation, yet they are meeting the needs of the common masses by growing food for them.He said the Centre wants that the farmers should get right price for their yields.Expressing concern over the infrastructural development on the farming land, the minister said, ""The farming lands that used to lie on the outskirts of the districts a few years ago have been merged into the city boundaries. Therefore, we are not left with much land that can be used for farming.""He added, ""It has become a necessity to increase the production of pulses, wheat etc as the dependence of people on farming has increased manifold.

From there it goes to state governments which ferry them to ration shops.""It's duty of the state governments to ensure that foodgrains reach beneficiaries in a proper manner,"" he added.Pawar paid a visit to IIPR to discuss latest research works and interact with pulses' farmers.On government measures in the field of agriculture, he said earlier the Union government was providing Rs 80,000 crore as farm loans at a relatively higher interest rate, but now it has raised the loan amount to Rs 3.70 lakh crore on which only 4 per cent interest rate is charged.Ten years back the government used to provide subsidy amount of Rs 20,000 crore which now has increased to Rs 80,000 crore, the minister said.The minister noted that while the country has adequate production of foodgrains like sugar, wheat and rice, but expressed concern over fall in domestic production of pulses and edible oil due which the country has to import them.""India is producing 14 million tonnes of pulses while the consumption of the commodity is 18 million tonnes. The shortage of 4 million tonnes is met through imports,"" he said.Likewise, due to shortage of production of edible oil the country has to go for its import, he added.Pawar is paying a visit to all the agricultural research institutes of the country to boost farm production.Local MP Rajaram Pal urged Pawar to set up either a potato food processing plant or a mega food park at Kanpur, an important city of Uttar Pradesh.Earlier, Pawar felicitated six farmers for record pulses cultivation."

Picture by Rajesh KumarNew Delhi, Feb. 3: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today expressed concern over soaring inflation and assured steps to moderate it. Food inflation rose to 17.5 per cent for the week ended January 22.Price rise always is a matter of grave concern. Efforts are being made both from the demand and the supply sides to moderate it, Mukherjee told reporters.Driven by higher prices of vegetables, fruits and eggs, food inflation increased for the second week in a row, going up 1.48 percentage points from 15.57 per cent in the previous week.Shanto Ghosh, Deloittes principal economist in India, said, The government needed to take steps to remove supply bottlenecks and plug leaks in the distribution system to tame price rise on a sustained basis.I expect the rising trend to be reversed within the next few weeks, Ghosh said.A string of measures were announced last month after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met senior ministers. The steps included duty-free import of onion, ban on the export of the bulb crop and action against hoarders.Some of the measures announced by the PMO to fight food inflation included support to raise the storage capacity of cereals and modernising godowns and other infrastructure.Crisils economist D.K. Joshi said the impact of the political crisis in Egypt and other West Asian countries on global crude prices might cast a shadow on headline inflation, which shot up to 8.43 per cent in December from 7.48 per cent a month ago.The RBI has increased the year-end headline inflation forecast to 7 per cent from the earlier estimate of 5.5 per cent.Among vegetables, onion prices on an annual basis rose 130.4 per cent in the third week of January, although rates have moderated considerably in the recent days.Vegetables became dearer by 77.05 per cent followed by fruits (15.47 per cent), egg, meat and fish (15.05 per cent), milk (11.41 per cent) and potatoes (6.22 per cent).The uptick in the latest food inflation figure is likely to put further pressure on the government to provide relief to the common man in the budget."

The rates at the Kalamna agriculture produce market yard have come down to almost Rs 15 a kg. While vendors dealing purely in onions and potatoes are quoting a rate of Rs 20-25 a kg, others are still charging Rs 30, which is way above last year's prices of Rs 10-15 a kg at this time.Traders at Kalamna expect a further fall in rates in coming days. Onions were quoted at Rs 600 a maund (40 kgs) in Thursday's auction, which is a fall of Rs 200 in last four days. There is abundant supply from Gujarat as well as centres like Ahmednagar, Nashik, and Jalgaon in Maharashtra. A month ago, the supplies were at 7 to 10 trucks of 16 tonnes each per day. This has now gone up to almost 25 trucks now, said Mohammed Afzal of M/s Afzal Traders.At Sriram Bhandar, a counter at Gokulpeth, white onions were being sold for Rs 20 a kg and the red variety at Rs 22. The stock was purchased at Rs 700 a maund which comes to Rs 17.5 a kg from Kalamna. A margin of Rs 3-5 has to be there to cover the expenses, said Ram Bhagle, proprietor. ""The prices here are lower compared to other vendors as we deal solely in onions and potatoes. The volumes take care of the profit,"" he said. Bhagle terms himself as a semi-wholesaler. Another such shop sold onions at Rs 25 a kg as they were purchased at higher rates, said the vendor here.""The typical sabziwallah who sells other vegetables too has to keep a higher rate as he buys in low quantities. His rates have to be higher in order to cover expenses over limited quantity. Selling cheaper is not feasible for them,"" added Bhagle."

Similar sales are also being reported from Asansol in Burdwan.In the last week of January, West Bengal State Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd popularly known as BENFED is said to have sold out 10,317 packets of 50 kg potatoes, each, at Ashirbad cold storage in Kandi, 23,469 packets in Domkal, 19,989 packets in Burwan and 19,053 packets at Jiagunj's B J cold storage. According to sources, some stock at Domkal went out for Rs12 a kg.Traders who bought the potatoes said most of the supply was ""rotten"" as the cold storages had stopped refrigeration since December 15. This, when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had pointed a finger at the Centre over a recent Supreme Court observation that foodgrains and vegetables were wasting in godowns.Ashoke Das and Nathun Ghosh, two cold storage workers, blamed the state for the loss. ""The government could have got the stock released in November,"" said Ghosh.Unwilling to comment on the issue, BENFED's district manager Sabatullah Sheikh said, ""We have nothing to do. We only carried out government instructions.""Authorities reportedly picked up lesser-known local bulletins to float the tender for purchase, 48 hours before the work order, a process that does not go well with government norms. The lack of transparency in the process prompted a section of cold storage owners to complain that the tender process was a sham. ""It was just a formality. Potatoes mentioned in the tender were sold out much earlier in November. It is a scam that needs to be looked into,"" a cold storage employee said.The procurement process is also not above scrutiny. For instance, most potatoes procured in Murshidabad were of inferior ""Pokhraj"" quality, not fit for storing. The admission came from senior CPM leader Benoy Konar. Besides, the stocks were procured from Gudhia in Jiagunj and Jayachandrapur in Nabagram, which are not potato-growing areas.Konar didn't rule out foul play in the transaction. ""I am not going into the specifics. It is my view that the government shouldn't have gone for purchasing potatoes. For, it doesn't have the expertise. In Murshidabad, the government incurred huge losses by purchasing inferior quality potatoes. In some cases, government red tape also comes in the way of instant decisions, which are vital in the trading of perishable commodities like potatoes,"" said Konar."

'We do not want to disclose the details (of Russian traders) with whom discussions are going on till the deal is finalised...otherwise some other potato suppliers (from Punjab) may move in, which may jeopardize our deal,' he explained.About two Russian traders have approached the potato growers of Punjab for the supply of the potato crop in the wake of massive shortage of potato in Russia because of low yield caused by extreme temperatures.'Their (Russian traders) requirement is about one lakh tonnes of potato from Punjab but we could not meet this huge requirement. We could supply only 10,000 tonnes of crop and they will have to source crop from the open market,' he said.What led Russian traders to source potato from Punjab was the low rate of the crop and its sufficient availability in view of the ongoing harvesting in the state. 'In view of huge shortage of potato, the rate (in Indian currency) has soared to Rs 30-32 per kg in Russia,' the potato grower from Punjab said.Traders have offered two options to Punjab potato growers for the supply of the crop. 'In the first option, they (the Russians) asked us to get the market rate of the crop and in second option they offered profit sharing in the deal,' he said. 'The current retail rate of potato in Punjab is Rs 5 per kg and if we include transportation cost for supply to Russia in refrigerated containers, the cost of Punjab's potato in Russia comes at Rs 20-22 a kg,' he said."

Krishnan, president, Swayasraya Karshaka Vipani at Kanthalloor, said the village has two types of climate as some areas fall in the rain shadow region.Wheat is also grown in Kanthallur. Owing to the climatic variation, vegetables are grown in the areas where rain is abundant and wheat is cultivated in the drier region.Vattavada lacks modern irrigation methods and the farmers follow traditional methods of cultivation with streams being the main source of water to the fields.The farmers use mainly two varieties of planting materials arriving from Mettupalayam in Tamil Nadu (Ootty variety) and the Bangalore variety.VegetablesS.R. Chandrasekhar, a farmer at Vattavada, said the main vegetables cultivated in this season are potato, cabbage, beetroot, beans, cauliflower, strawberry and garlic.He said that a sack of potato seeds (40 to 45 kg) arriving from Mettupalayam costs Rs 700 to Rs 750. This is the variety preferred by the farmers.According to Chinnathara Babu, another farmer, only one-third of the total area is under cultivation this season due to the lack of water."

It was 22.08 per cent a year-ago.The last time food inflation has come down to such a level was for the week ended December 11 when it stood at 12.13 per cent.Experts said there would be further slide in inflation rates due to the expected record crop of wheat and pulses.Government estimates suggest overall foodgrain production for 2010-11 at 232.07 million tonnes, against 218.2 million tonnes last year.Wheat production is estimated to touch an all-time high of 81.47 million tonnes in 2010-11 crop year.Pulses and cotton production are also projected to set fresh records of 16.51 million tonnes and 33.9 million bales, respectively.""In the coming weeks we could expect further moderation in food prices, specially foodgrains.

The inflation in December stood at 8.43 per cent.""The overall WPI inflation for January 2011 is expected at around 8.5 per cent, on back of high primary inflation,"" ICRA economist Aditi Nayar said.The decline in food inflation numbers is also unlikely to ease pressure on Reserve Bank, whose current monetary policy stance is anti-inflationary.The apex bank had last month raised short term lending and borrowing rates by 25 basis points to tame rising prices.During the week ended January 29, prices of pulses fell 8.63 per cent, potatoes by 8.87 per cent and wheat by 3.58 per cent on an annual basis, data released by the government showed.Onion prices, which more than doubled in the previous week, has eased subsequently. However, the kitchen staple still remain dearer by 79 per cent for the week under review.Last month, goverment pumped in 300 metric tonnes of imported onions and would bring in another 426 tonnes in the market soon.Vegetables as a whole have turned costlier by 44.34 per cent on an annual basis during the week under review.ICRA's Nayar, however, said that vegetable prices are expected to ease in the coming weeks.During the week, fruits and milk became costlier by 10.46 per cent and 11.66 per cent respectively, while egg, meat and fish turned expensive by 17.06 per cent. Experts, however, said that high international crude prices may act as a dampener in moderating the headline inflation.In its quarterly review last month, the RBI estimated that overall inflation would be around 7 per cent by March-end.For the week ended January 29, ""fuel and power"" category prices shot up 11.61 per cent on an annual basis, while petrol became expensive by over 30 per cent.""The Egypt situation has potential to affect inflation,"" Joshi said, referring to the current impasse in the Arab nation where demonstrators have been on the streets since last month demanding immediate resignation of long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak.There is apprehension that the political stalemate in Egypt could affect flow of crude through the Suez Canal, the world's busiest commercial waterway.Similar views have already been expressed by the Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, senior government officials and the RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn."

63,"Industry seeks APMC Act repeal, farmers eye overseas sales",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Industry-seeks-APMC-Act-repeal-farmers-eye-overseas-sales/articleshow/7489831.cms,2011-02-14,The Times Of India,"MUMBAI: Farmers angry over plummeting wholesale prices continued their strike at the APMC's Lasalgaon onion mandi. The strike began last week as rates fell to Rs 2 per kg (Rs 200 per quintal). Alongwith APMC traders, they demanded that India resume onion exports arguing it will fetch them a better price. Experts however say the situation could have been avoided if farmers were allowed to sell their produce in the open market.The clamour is growing to abolish or at least amend the monopolistic APMC Act that fuelled the onion crisis. The Act forces farmers to sell perishable items like fruits and vegetables only to a limited number of licenced traders at APMC mandis, thereby encouraging cartelisation in agriculture marketing.The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) has been campaigning for growers to be allowed to sell their crops to any trader or company that offers a better price, and now a wing of the ministry of food and public distribution is also lending its voice to the cause. Of course, APMC officials are feeling the jitters. Ficci director general Rajiv Kumar has called for an express amendment, if not a total abolition, of the APMC Act. ""You cannot have a situation where farmers must either sell to a limited colluding set of buyers or go back home with their produce. Over the years, this APMC cartel has been shortchanging farmers and also driving up prices in the retail market,'' he says.APMC officials are however on the defensive. ""The Act does not require any amendment,"" says Ashok Walunj, head of the onion-potato market at Vashi APMC. ""Trade cannot survive without middlemen. Were it not for us, the farmers would not be paid a fair price for their goods on the spot. Exports should rather be resumed so farmers get a better deal.""The APMC Act was instituted in the mid-60s to ensure farmers get the right price for their produce with immediate cash payment. ""With time, trading volumes have improved. Meanwhile, traders who continue to hold licences by default since generations have become a strong cartel. The Act discourages competition by limiting the number of players and naturally lends to the collusion,'' Kumar says.Interestingly, the ratio of price rise from farmer to consumer is 1:4, which means it is the grower and the end consumer who are cheated most. ""For instance, transportation cost is not more than Rs 4-5 per kg for any food item anywhere in the country,'' says another Ficci official. ""But we have been paying Rs 70-80 per kg for onions in the retail market compared to the wholesale rate of Rs 30-35 at APMC mandis in production zones. Why not allow the farmer to sell directly to the public at Rs 40, where he makes a profit and the consumer spends less too?''The Centre can do little on this front for the APMC Act is a state subject. ""Powerful traders at each mandi work in close proximity with politicians of those state, which is why even those states where the Act has been amended fail to show the desired results,'' says an expert. The central government must convince states to de-list perishables such as fruits and vegetables from Schedule-1 of the Act and allow for competition, he added. ""This Act puts growers of perishable items like fruits and vegetables at a distinct disadvantage. Unlike farmers who grow non-perishables like rice, wheat or oilseeds and can wait to sell at an appropriate price, people who grow onion, potato and vegetables are forced to sell their produce that very day at whatever price they get,'' says an expert.An important arm of the ministry of food and public distribution is also supporting this change. The chairman of the National Cooperative Consumers' Federation (NCCF) Virendra Singh has suggested that the government 'revisit' the Act. ""Even farmers who sell outside the APMC yard and do not use its facilities are charged a fee. There is no justification for this,'' Singh said."

The headline inflation, based on wholesale prices, has remained above 8 per cent-mark since January 2010.The fall in inflation has been mainly on account of declining prices of sugar (down 14.99 per cent), pulses (12.78 per cent), wheat (4.94 per cent) and potato (1.21 per cent). However, vegetable and fruits continued to remain expensive. On an annual basis, vegetable prices rose by 65 per cent, and onion prices nearly doubled. Also, fruits became costly by 15.01 per cent and egg, meat and fish by 15.09 per cent.Overall, primary articles became costly by 17.28 per cent with food articles rising 15.65 per cent. In the non-food articles category, fibre prices rose by 48 per cent on an annual basis.Prices of fuel and power shot up by 11.41 per cent, with petrol rising 27.37 per cent on an year-on-year basis. However, among manufactured items, sugar prices fell by 15 per cent, while edible oils turned costlier by 7.16 per cent. The inflation number for November has also been revised upwards to 8.08 per cent from 7.48 per cent, according to government data released today.The easing of inflation is expected to come as a morale booster for the government which have been under pressure due to high prices of food items in recent months. It also shows that Reserve Bank of India's action of raising rates seven times since March 2010 has started showing some result. It may be recalled, the food inflation, which accounts for over 14 per cent in the overall Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation, has remained high since December scaling up to 18.32 per cent.

Considering that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had no option but to up its comfort zone for inflation to 7 per cent for 2010-11 from 5-6 per cent projected earlier, analysts feel that the apex bank is unlikely to ease its hawkish stance on key policy rates during the mid-quarterly monetary review on March 17.Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) Chairman C. Rangarajan is of the view that further monetary tightening may be necessary to contain the inflationary pressures. [The] RBI will have to take a view looking at level of inflation. It is still at an uncomfortably high level. Some action, continued action, by the RBI [to tighten monetary policy] may be required, he said. The WPI headline inflation data for January has revealed that while sugar turned cheaper by 14.99 per cent, pulses by 12.78 per cent, wheat by 4.94 per cent and potatoes by 1.21 per cent on a year-on-year basis, vegetable prices remained higher by 65 per cent and onion prices were almost double. Alongside, fruits were dearer by 15.01 per cent, as were protein-based items such as eggs, meat and fish by 15.09 per cent. In a cautiously optimistic note, Mr. Mukherjee said: Even though overall food inflation is a matter of concern, we must remember that we have come a long way from the peak...we still have some distance to go in controlling inflation.As for the fuel and power' category, the index surged by 11.41 per cent mainly owing to the prices of petrol soaring by 27.37 per cent on an annual basis. Overall, primary articles group became costly by 17.28 per cent, with food articles rising 15.65 per cent.Meanwhile, the inflation number for November 2010 stands revised upwards at 8.08 per cent from its provisional estimate of 7.48 per cent.It is too little to be comfortable, says Pranab Mukherjee"

Also, availability of land in Ethopia at much cheaper cost than in India encouraged farmers to cultivate the land in Ethiopia.Land is available for farming on lease of 25 to 45 years period. Moreover, in Ethiopia, the cost of land on lease is Rs.500 per hectare, while in Punjab the cost varies between Rs.25,00030,000 per hectare, he added.Farmers have zeroed in on a few African areas, including Gambela and Oromia, for cultivating land.Moreover, the Ethiopian Government has promised to support farming by Indian farmers in every manner.Last year, the External Affairs Ministry had arranged a meeting of representatives of several African countries, including Ethiopia, Uganada, Zambia, and Tanzania with Punjab farmers and these countries invited them to develop land and invest in agriculture. - PTI"

In quite some time, food inflation will also be under single digit, Mukherjee said, adding that headline inflation will moderate to 7 per cent by March-end from 8.23 per cent in January.Driven by high vegetable prices, food inflation has been in double digits for the past two months and had even crossed 18 per cent in the last week of December.On an annual basis, prices of potatoes declined by 13.63 per cent, pulses by 5.88 per cent and wheat by 2.54 per cent in the week ended February 5.However, on the whole, vegetables became nearly 24 per cent costlier during the week ended February 5. This was primarily on account of onions, which were 31.33 per cent higher during the week on an annual basis. Meanwhile, decline in food inflation for past two weeks prompted Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia to say the trend would continue.Other economists, however, said while there would be further moderation in vegetable prices, overall food inflation will remain in double digits in this month.Even though prices have come down over the previous week, the average rate of food inflation on a yearly basis, at 17 per cent, is still high. The finance minister also sounded caution that weekly decline in food inflation could be deceptive. He, however, expects wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation to come down to 7 per cent by March-end.I hope, as I mentioned earlier, by March we able to reach overall inflation of 7 per cent, Mukherjee added. Headline inflation, as measured on the basis of WPI, moderated to 8.23 per cent in January from 8.43 per cent in the previous month. During the first week of February, the fuel price index was up 11.92 per cent for the week."

The decline in the cost of many vegetables is nearly half when compared to the prices in January.Many visitors to the Koyambedu market said large portions of mint and coriander leaves were also being given free of cost when they purchased vegetables. Curry leaves continue to be expensive with a bunch priced Rs.10 owing to shortfall in supply.G. Chandra, a resident of Koyambedu, said, When I visited the market last month, I paid Rs.7 for the same quantity of coriander leaves, which was given free of cost on Wednesday. As the prices of the vegetables are less, I bought twice the quantity as you never know when the prices will go up.Vendors said many customers filled their bags with vegetables, whose prices have dropped sharply in the recent weeks.S. Marimuthu, a wholesale vendor, said a 50-kg bag of brinjals, is sold at Rs.100-Rs.150 at the market. A sack containing 12 cauliflowers is sold at Rs.80-Rs.100.With more arrivals from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in the past week, a sack of mint and coriander leaves is sold at Rs.20.Two bunches of coriander leaves come for Rs.1 to Rs.2, he said. But, the price of curry leaves is likely to rule high for another month with a 5-kg bag of curry leaves costing Rs.200.According to V.R. Soundararajan, adviser to theKoyambedu Wholesale Onion Traders' Association, the price of onions, which soared to Rs.100 a kg two months ago, is now Rs.15 in the wholesale market and Rs.20 in retail shops.Tomatoes are sold at Rs.15 a kg. Even carrots, drumsticks and broad beans, which are relatively expensive, are priced between Rs.10 to Rs.12 a kg in the wholesale market. The number of lorries transporting produce to the market has increased to 350 now from 200 last month, he added.However, consumers complained that the retail prices of some vegetables, including beans, potato and carrot, remain high. There is at least a difference of Rs.10 a kg. While the wholesale rate of one kg of potato is Rs.13, the retail shops sell them at Rs.26, said R.Kavitha, a resident of Perambur.Rates have dropped by nearly half when compared to prices in January"

On an annual basis, overall vegetables remained about 24 per cent dearer during the week mainly owing to higher prices of onions as compared to the previous year. However, potatoes turned cheaper by 13.63 per cent.Even as Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia expects the declining trend in food inflation to continue, other analysts are of the view that the WPI numbers would remain in double digits during the whole of February despite a further fall in vegetable prices. The basis for this apprehension is that even though prices have come down as compared to the previous week, the average rate of food inflation is still high at 17 per cent on a yearly basis."

76,The crisis in agriculture,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/140537/crisis-agriculture.html,2011-02-23,Deccan Herald,"The crisis in agricultureLast updated: 23 February, 2011Prem Shankar Jha 22:19 ISTThe transformation of Indian agriculture started in the 80s when farmers began to shift out of foodgrains into cash crops.The government has blamed the vagaries of the weather in 2009 and 2010 for the food shortages that have ratcheted up inflation this year. This is the obvious explanation, but it happens to be wrong. Food prices became the driver of inflation 5 years earlier in 2006.What is more, their rise has been virtually impervious to recession, drought and bumper harvests  9 per cent during in 2008-09, 16 per cent in 2009-10, and 14 per cent till December 2010 after one of the best monsoons in living memory.The government has been able to do nothing to halt or even moderate this inflation because its origins lie in a deep, and growing, crisis is agriculture. The crisis is not a product of neglect. On the contrary, if one were to judge by the implicit and explicit subsidies that farmers receive no other sector has been so thoroughly pampered.It arises out of an inexplicable failure of the Indian state to understand the change that has taken place in the nature of farming during the last 20 years. The two lakh farmers suicides since 1998 are the worst, but not only, the consequences of this failure.The transformation of agriculture began in the 80s when the Green revolution started running out of steam. Seeing the writing on the wall farmers began to shift out of foodgrains into cash crops. As a result between 1990 and 2009 the area under foodgrains declined by 3.6 per cent, but the area under cash crops grew by more than 25 per cent.Farmers made the change with extreme caution, expanding the cultivation of the cash crops that were relatively imperishable: sugar cane, oilseeds, jute and cotton all of which commanded ready markets. But the cities were growing and the demand for fruits, vegetables and dairy products was rising exponentially. To meet it, farmers followed the same route: from the relatively imperishable potatoes and onions to tomatoes, cauliflower, cabbages, eggplants, and other more delicate produce. Every step on this road involved a rise in risk.Without the necessary support structure, perishability put a natural limit to the expansion of the area under each crop. Thus, the area under sugar cane stopped rising in 2001-02, and under oilseeds in 2004. The area sown with potatoes doubled between 1980-81 and 1999-2000, but then grew at less than half that pace in the 2000s.But these were relatively imperishable products. The area under onions, which are more perishable, grew by a mere 6 per cent between 1997 and 2004, and came to a complete halt after 2006. Tomatoes and eggplants have exhibited the same behaviour.But this has not stopped farmers from continuing the shift to cash crops. As the cities have grown and become richer, farmers have responded by increasing their yields per hectare. Between 2006 and 2011 they have increased the yield of potatoes by 20 per cent and that of onions by 21 per cent. To do this they have bought expensive new seeds, often imported, sometimes genetically modified; and increased their other inputs.This has led to a quantum jump in their working capital needs. With every passing year therefore they have placed themselves more firmly at the mercy of a whimsical fate and an indifferent state.Tragedy of cottonNo story of the crisis in agriculture will be complete without a description of the tragedy of cotton. Nurtured in the protective arms of monopoly procurement, import bans and the multi-fibre agreement which, paradoxically, protected Indian textiles exports, cotton was the white gold of the 70s and 80s. Everything changed at the end of the 90s. The winding up of The EUs the Multi-Fire agreement freed the mill sector and made it concentrate on world markets once more.Cotton farmers not only checked the growth of imports but began to export their produce. In 2008-09 while the import of raw cotton and cotton yarn was valued at $480 million, the export of cotton fetched the country $2.01 billion.But obtaining higher yields has involved more initial investment and hence incurring a higher level of risk. For thousands of farmers every year this has proved too high to bear. Several recent studies have been unanimous in their conclusion that the principal cause of cotton farmers suicides is their lack of access to bank finance. Tenants do not qualify. Small farmers are turned away.A study of several districts in Andhra Pradesh concluded that 80 to 85 per cent of the rural credit still comes from money lenders. It also showed that the agricultural extension service had become moribund and was non-existent for the newer cash crops. Farmers were therefore at the mercy of private seed traders.Manmohan Singhs government has tried its level best to end the spate of farmers suicides by waiving farm loans and fixing the interest rate on fresh loans at 7 per cent. But so long as banks demand fixed asset as collateral for their loans the vast majority of farmers will remain shut out. One way around this would be to give loans against the value of the crop but only to farmers who insure it. Unfortunately, crop insurance doesnt exist.However, the solution to this problem could lie in a novel application of the practice of hedging loans against unforeseen contingencies that is routine in international finance. All farmers, large or small, landowner or tenant, should be eligible for loans at the priority sector interest rate provided they agree to pay an additional two or three per cent to cover the cost of insuring their crop. If this has not already been thought of, it can only be because the government has still to realise that farming, specially cash crop farming, is now an industry and deserves the same treatment."
77,"Despite growth, hunger pangs reality for millions",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Despite-growth-hunger-pangs-reality-for-millions/articleshow/7552496.cms,2011-02-23,The Times Of India,"Although finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had promised food security and inclusive growth in his budget speech last year, hunger continues to stalk over 300 million citizens of the country. India slipped to 67th place in the Global Hunger Index 2010 rankings of 122 countries prepared by International Food Policy Research Institute. An Oxford University report said that 410 million Indians live in poverty. While there may be nit-picking over the actual numbers, but one thing is clear  there is widespread if not alarming hunger and malnutrition in the country despite a high growth trajectory.The situation dramatically worsened in the past year with vegetable prices zooming up by over 24%. Since March last year, potato prices rose by over 75% and onion rocketed up by a jaw-dropping 300% for a few months pushing these staple vegetables out reach of large sections of people. Inflation had become a vehicle for sustaining malnutrition and hunger in the country.Yet, the government continues to drag its feet on such crucial measures as providing cheap food grain to the people according to a study by the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), a Delhi based think tank. The single biggest step that could reduce hunger and bring down prices of essential food items - universalisation of the public distribution system - has been stuck in wrangling between policy wonks.CBGA's study points out that providing cheap wheat and rice to about 24 crore households in the country would cost the exchequer Rs.1,44,141 crore. The government is already spending Rs.55,578 crore on providing food subsidies as per 2010-11 budget estimates. So, the net additional cost would be Rs.88,563 crore per year.Many economists argue that India can ill afford spending such huge amounts on food subsidies. But calling such arguments ""unsubstantiated"", CBGA said that food subsidies amount to less than 1% of India's GDP and less than 4% of the combined expenditure incurred by state governments and Union government annually.""Financial constraints can never be an excuse for denying the basic needs of the masses, and even less so when the government is prepared to forego tax revenue (as exemptions and deductions in both direct and indirect taxes) to the extent of Rs.5,02,299 crore for a single fiscal year (2009-10),"" says the CBGA study.The argument that there are not enough foodgrain to distribute to all the people too comes in for criticism in the study. As per the Second Advance Estimates released on 12 February 2010, the procurement of wheat and rice was 253.9 lakh tonnes and 236.9 lakh tonnes respectively last year, which accounted for only about 23 percent of the total food production. Universal public distribution would involve procurement of 1008 lakh tonnes of foodgrain. Enhancing the procurement levels can easily do this, the study says.Last year in August, the Supreme Court had directed that 17.8 million tonnes of grain in danger of rotting in government godowns should be distributed to the people. This was after there were reports that 67,000 tonnes of wheat had been spoiled in the rainy season due to insufficient protection in godowns. Such tragic waste could be avoided if the government were to streamline the public distribution system, plug leakage and build infrastructure to deal with storage and transportation issues."

Taking lessons from the rush witnessed to buy food items, even at exorbitant rates, the food sub-committee of NGOC has roped in a co-operative society Vegfed, to set up as many as 50 food stalls in and around Birsa Munda Athletics stadium during the closing ceremony of the Games. We will put up 60,000 bottles of water, 30,000 bottles of cold drinks and potato chips, among other packaged items, for sale during the closing ceremony of the Games, said Arun Kumar Singh, head of the food sub-committee of NGOC. The Vegfed stalls will be manned by members of Jharkhand Dairy Project and would sell food items at their maximum retail prices only. Incidentally, the idea of setting up food stalls by select vendors had failed to click with the audiences during the opening ceremony, due to alleged lack of planning by the executing agency  New Churuwala. While there was chaos at the paltry number of food stalls that had been set up, spectators complained of being fleeced at the food court. New Churuwala officials, however, alleged highhandedness by police officers in preventing their men from entering the stadium. Meanwhile, a lavish spread of food items would be on the platter for former president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who would be in state to grace the convocation of BIT-Mesra. Chief minister Arjun Munda will host Kalam, who is likely to visit Khel Gaon, for dinner on February 24. The dinner christened Bada khana, which will see the presence of governor M.O.H. Farook and assembly speaker C.P. Singh, among others, will have local state cuisines as well as special south Indian dishes to tempt the taste buds of its guests. Elsewhere, tickets for closing ceremony remained in demand for the second day, as various SBI branches witnessed notched up good sales today.The tickets for the closing ceremony are in great deman, especially among the youths, we have sold all the 8,000 tickets that were given to us by the NGOC today, said Arun Pandey, chief manager of SBI.

Conceding that high food prices has been a matter of concern, Dr. Singh said: I will be the first one to admit that inflation in the last 18 months has become a problem. There were reasons beyond our control. First of all, there was the drought of 2009 and there were natural calamities which affected the production of important products such as vegetables and onions.Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia also maintained that food inflation would ease to single digit by the end of the current fiscal while noting that the country had sufficient stocks of cereals to stem the inch-up in prices. The WPI data revealed that prices of cereals had increased a tad during the week ended February 12 with inflation in cereals at 2.07 per cent and rice at 1.65 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Alongside, however, prices of other edibles continued to soar, with eggs, meat and fish turning dearer by 14.79 per cent and milk costlier by 16.99 per cent.During the week, prices of vegetables surged by 15.89 per cent although potatoes were cheaper by 9.72 per cent. Milk prices also went up by five per cent while mutton turned two per cent dearer.As for fuel items, prices of furnace oil and naphtha rose by two per cent each. Global markets are anticipating a further rise owing to the ongoing political crisis in various countries in West Asia and North Africa. Already crude oil prices have touched a two-year high of $99.10 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange while Brent crude has soared to $120 a barrel."
83,Tangy trailers,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/tangy-trailers/,2011-02-26,Indian Express,"Presenting five places in the city that will guarantee you a mean chaat to gorge onIts a quick bite when the stomach and the wallet both are running on reserve. Its a meal that is not quite a meal  it was originally meant to only provide temporary satisfaction from hunger,but today entire meals are had just from this. As food-on-the-go,few meals have the kind of allure and the grudging respect of all sections of society that chaat elicits . Rich or poor,no self-respecting Indian has not had chaat . The vendors sit everywhere  from bus depots to train stations,from outside movie theatres to inside malls. Usually spicy and/or fried,chaat was once dismissed as a food for women,but today,men will unabashedly admit that they too crave it. To keep all chaat dreams alive,here are five places in the city where you can satisfy your palate.Kalyan BhelBibvewadiTo the foodies of the city,Kalyan Bhel needs no introduction. To those who are new,the fact that it has its own Facebook fan page will speak volumes. Opened 34 years ago,Kalyan is popular with students and working professionals alike,so much so that today it has six branches scattered across the city. Our secret is that we have kept our prices as low as possible and that we have not changed our ingredients at all since we first started. Perhaps that is why people across generations still come to us, says Ramesh Pondare of the restaurant.Manmeet Chaat,Fergusson College RoadHaving an eatery right opposite one of the most famous colleges in the city can sometimes be a disadvantage  if your food is bad,your patrons,the majority of whom will inevitably be college students,will not hesitate to point it out. But Manmeet Chaat has no such problems. Serving its chaat with a slight Uttar Pradesh twist,the place is immensely popular with college students and is always jam-packed. What we serve is the regular chaat  perhaps that is what attracts our customers to us, says Jagdish Arora (name changed). Most people fiddle with the ingredients,and that may not always work,but as far as we are concerned,it has to be the authentic thing. A lot of students here are also from North India,and since we serve the same chaat that is made in UP,it perhaps also reminds a lot of them of home. The snacks that are must-haves here are the chola bhatura and their special basket chaat ,which consists of edible baskets made from mashed and fried potatoes and filled with a sweet and tangy chutney.Ganesh BhelKarve NagarStarted in 1978,Ganesh Bhel has not only set itself apart from the rest by offering a free-home-delivery service,but it also exports its chaat to eager customers in cities like Singapore and Dubai.  Bhel ,paani puri and SPDP ( Sev Puri Dahi Puri ) are what we are most famous for, says Rupesh Gudmewar of the eatery,which has many branches across the city. Usually our patrons are students,specifically girls. He cant help but grin at that.Bandhai Sweet MartKondhwaThis restaurant serves typical Maharashtrian chaat ,and is a big hit with students and elders alike. Beware: this joint can have a waiting period of up to 30 minutes on weekends,and weekdays are no breeze either. People flock to us because of our famous ragda patis , declares Mangilal Chaudhary of the eatery,with more than just a hint of pride.Chaat GharWakadThis eatery is one of the few in the city that deals exclusively with the Delhi-style of chaats . We have quite a spread,and apart from chaats ,we also offer dishes like stuffed parathas and have certain meal combos that make us quite popular among students,who live on a tight budget, says Naresh Mathur of the restaurant. Chaat ghar is famous for its aloo tikki chole chaat and samosa chaat .For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
84,Con-fusion Food,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/confusion-food/,2011-02-27,Indian Express,"With too much on the platter,Chai Coffi doesnt do complete justice to everything it offersWith Egg Bhurji at Rs 125 and Toast at Rs 60,you pretty much know what to expect when you visit the newly-opened eatery Chai Coffi at Versova.A venture by actress Ayesha Takia and her restaurateur husband Farhan Azmi,this place is quite reminiscent of Cafe Basilico (same management) with its purple boundary walls,wooden doors at the entrance and brown wooden furniture. Theres an al fresco dining area with a tiny indoor portion,and the dcor is top-notch. If they didnt play the loud electro-dance music and opted for something more soothing,the ambience would be perfect.Chai Coffi replaces the iconic Barista which used to be a regular hangout joint for college students,aspiring actors and casting agents. With a price hike one is not sure if the place will be as crowded as it used to be before,but the evening we visited it was filled with actors from the television fraternity.While the menu selection at Chai Coffi has street food influences,it is balanced of it with a section on cold deli sandwiches,bagels,paninis,waffles,salads and pizza by the slice. The best part about these,they are all freshly made once you place your order. The eatery also has fusion food,like the couscous upma which is a mix of the Middle-Eastern couscous with the South Indian upma. Tea shop snacks such as laadi pav,naan khatai,milk rusk form the most impressive section on the menu. We chose the brun maska and butter khari  the khari was crisp,but the brun could have been a tad fresher. Munchies like Onion Bhajiya with the green chutney and Cheese Corn Balls are a must-try at Chai Coffi.Considering its moniker,Chai Coffis tea and coffee selection isnt extraordinary. From the list on the menu we picked the cutting chai and cafe latte. The latte was just right and most coffee shops in the vicinity could take a lesson or two from them. The cutting chai was served in a typical cutting glass,but for the tea in it we would rather head to our neighbourhood tea stall. On the other hand,the masala chai had that much-required punch which tea drinkers relish.Although the menu clearly demarcates the breakfast items from the rest,you will be surprised to know that they are available all day long. We ordered a Kheema Pav (Rs 190) and a Philly Cheese Bagel (Rs 290). The Kheema Pav was highly disappointing with green peas and potatoes added to it. And more so because Mumbai has some of the best Irani cafes that serve delectable Kheema pav. The bagel was alright,but were not sure of spending Rs 290 on it. The pizza we ordered was the pick of the lot. It was reminiscent of those we have had at Cafe Basilico. It was only later that we discovered that the chef from Basilico had prepared it. We ended our evening with Phirni and Chocolate Truffle. While the Phirni was so chilled,that we bit into some pieces of ice,with chocolate not many can go wrong.Given the lovely location,Chai Coffi could have been so much more than a confused cafe-pizzeria hybrid. If they only get rid of some of the items on the menu and focus their attention on a few,they could do a lot better.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Onions and wheat fell by 3.64 per cent and 2.06 per cent respectively.The items that became dearer during the week ended February 19 vis-a-vis the corresponding year-ago period were fruits (16.34 per cent), egg, meat and fish (14.5 per cent), vegetables (14.29 per cent) and milk (11.07 per cent).""The current inflation in food is unacceptably high. We have to work towards bringing this down,"" Chief Economic Advisor Kaushik Basu said.Basu stressed on using the provisions of the competition law to prevent cartelisation by traders to jack up prices of essential food items.""There is a need to invoke anti-competition law,"" he said while calling for measures against cartelisation to bring down the prices.The competition watchdog CCI is already probing the role of traders' cartel in the sudden spike in onion prices in December last year.Experts said though declining prices of certain food items will have a favourable impact on headline inflation in February, yet fuel prices will be something that needs to be watched.""Inflation, not just food inflation, is an immediate challenge the country is facing... We have to see how fuel prices become volatile and how it impacts our import bill,"" ICICI Bank Managing Director Chanda Kochchar said.Inflation declined marginally to 8.23 per cent in January from 8.43 per cent in the previous month, as prices of certain commodities like wheat, pulses and sugar eased.Commenting on the food inflation figures released today, Crisil's chief economist D K Joshi, said ""that was expected.

We have to work towards bringing this down. But we can't just do that in 2-3 weeks because that would result in interest rates going sky high or lead to closure of factories. It has to be through measures and steps, Dr. Basu said.To tackle the price spiral, Dr. Basu suggested invoking provisions of the competition law to prevent cartelisation by traders. For the Competition Commission of India (CCI), that would mean extending investigations to other food items as the competition watchdog is already probing the role of trade cartel which led to a sudden spurt in onion prices in December 2010."

Government data showed that the food price index rose 10.39% in the year to February 19, easing from the previous week's 11.49%. Food inflation had suddenly spurted in early February after displaying signs of moderation. The fuel price index rose 12.56% in the year to February 19, rising from 12.14% in the previous week.But prices of fruits, milk and some vegetables still remained firm. Economists expect moderation in food prices in the weeks ahead but say there are other challenges on the horizon which will keep inflationary expectations high.Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee announced a slew of measures in his Budget for 2011-12 to improve food supplies and raise farm productivity. The government expects overall inflation to ease to 7% by March-end but economists say it would be difficult to keep it within the estimate, given the sharp increase in global commodity and crude prices.

Thats its untapped potential. Consider this.How much is lal rice for? asks a middle-aged European lady from a shopkeeper. Her clothes are like her language  they express cultural fusion. Right across,a shop assistant at a vegetable store is assisting a group of Korean girls searching for Thai Basil and cherry tomatoes. Where can we find olive oil? they ask him in English. He gestures towards a grocery store and responds in Hindi.Take a cue from the European ladys lal rice query. Available only in select stores in the city otherwise,red rice,much lower in calorie content than white,is in plenty at the INA market with several shops selling it at Rs 40 per kg. Red rice is common in south Indian cuisine,and,though it takes a little longer to cook (45 to 60 minutes) than regular white rice,its fuller grains fall in the same category as brown rice in terms of nutrients.There are other diet-happy foods. The market stocks weight-loss products imported from South East Asia,Australia,the US and the UK,at lower prices than some other branded outlets in the city. Here you can purchase extra virgin olive oil (Rs 1100 for five litres),the backbone of healthy cooking,at wholesale prices.To add to it all,there is Ragi (finger millet) substituted by many nutritionists for wheat. Ragi contains less starch,and has only a third of the calories, quips Kartikey Raju,a shopkeeper at the market,who seems to have picked up diet lingo. But if you love noodles,dont sweat. There are healthier alternatives like Korean sweet potato starch noodles,or japchae which does not use white flour. Low on calories,these glass noodles are more filling.Now indulge,but with restraint. Sugar-free cookies,biscuits and shortbread are available in several flavours in addition to multi-grain and digestive biscuits as well as several slimming teas. Slim a soup packets are available in exotic flavours like Cajun spicy vegetable,creamy chicken and sweetcorn,which can be used as a meal replacement in a time crunch. Slimming teas are sold at wholesale prices. One helpful mix we came across was Australian brand Capilanos honey and lemon syrup mix (Rs 250). Conveniently packaged,the syrup,otherwise used to glaze pancakes,can also be diluted in warm water and had for weight loss,an oft-advised diet prescription.

What's more: Growing your own vegetables can help you relax and destress, and, more importantly, save money.Pressed for space in apartments and shocked by the escalating prices of fruits and vegetables, a small yet determinedly growing group of city residents is looking skyward to grow vegetables, greens, and herbs for meals and medication. From vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, yam, tomato, onion, ladies finger, green chilli, various types of gourds, drumstick, plantain and greens, some are even giving paddy a shot in pet bottles.""Use sky space even if you live in a small apartment,"" advises Founder of Exnora International M B Nirmal, who has set up a terrace garden in his former residence on Giriappa Road in T Nagar and also in his current residence in Arumbakkam. Corporation mayor M Subramanian, who inaugurated Nirmal's garden for public viewing on Monday, is also interested in setting up a garden on the terrace of his home.Rooftop gardens need little upfront investment. Milk trays, bought from the waste paper mart, can grow greens and mint; huge plastic drums that once contained chemicals can house plantain trees and corn; throwaway tyres can be stacked one on top of the other to hold enough soil to grow plants; holes in pipes placed vertically give ample space for green chillies to peep out.You may need little cash to start, but the gardens need another type of investment -- time. One needs to take some time off everyday to water and take care of the plants. This time could well be considered a destressing exercise.Regular harvesting and recycling of wastes is needed to maintain the garden and get the most yield from it. If the garden is sustained by sullage water from the household and nourished with kitchen wastes it retains its organic nature and is that much more healthy. No need to pay double the price for organic food from the supermarket.As awareness grows, more people are signing up for training programmes conducted by the Urban Horiculature Development Centre on rooftop gardening. Some 16 people turned up for the last programme, said P Santhi, professor and head of the centre.Santhi suggests that first-timers waterproof the terrace and see to it that the water does not stagnate. The roof must be able to support the weight of the plants and the pots in which they are placed. One can even grow vegetables like potatoes and mushrooms in gunny bags, but be prepared to accept the fact that the yield will not be the same as planting them in the ground.Shanthi Gopal, a resident of Mangalipillai Thottam on Giriappa Road, lives in matchbox-sized houses, but finds the space to grow a sprig of tulasi, karpuravalli and jasmine in her house. She says her daily prayers near the tulasi plant; uses karpuravalli herb to make tonics for her children when they catch a cold; and the jasmine adorns her hair.Shanthi is now inspired by her success to grow more plants. ""After all, they need but very little space and a little care. But the plants pay us back in good measure,"" she added."

The rate of price rise of food items has fallen to a single-digit figure for the first time since the week ended December 4, 2010, when it was 9.46 per cent.The latest figures are expected to give a breather to the government, which has been under increasing pressure to rein in the inflationary pressure caused by high food and crude oil prices.For the week under review, prices of wheat declined by 1.07 per cent on an annual basis, while pulses rates fell by 3.91 per cent.Prices of potatoes also fell by nearly 9 per cent year-on-year.However, vegetables continued to be expensive and their prices went up by 9.23 per cent on annual basis. In particular, onion prices were up by 3.90 per cent year-on-year.Rice also became dearer by 1.16 per cent year-on-year.Egg, meat and fish became 15.38 per cent costlier.Meanwhile, fruits prices rose by 18.75 per cent and milk by 8.42 per cent on an annual basis.The non-food articles category saw a price rise of 29.85 per cent during the week on an annual basis.Fuel and power also became 9.48 per cent more expensive, while petrol became costlier by 23.14 per cent.High food prices have been one of the major factors behind high overall inflation.

Rangarajan said: Food inflation [is] in single digit... It will come down to below 7 per cent by the end of March.According to economic analysts, the dip in food inflation is unlikely to douse overall inflationary expectations, mainly owing to the rising trend in global commodity prices.In particular, with the political turmoil in the Arab world nowhere near getting resolved in the short-term, the resultant spike in crude oil prices is a matter of grave concern for all oil import-dependent economies such as India.In the event, despite the fall in food inflation, the Reserve Bank is unlikely to press the pause button on its monetary tightening measures during its mid-quarterly policy review on March 17 as some essential items are still ruling at higher levels."

99,Inflation may cost Congress-BPF govt,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/Inflation-may-cost-Congress-BPF-govt/articleshow/7713279.cms,2011-03-16,The Times Of India,"GUWAHATI: During the course of the past year, food prices spiralled upwards like never before. Potatoes the common man's vegetable that have always come cheap sold at Rs 30, onions touched a staggering Rs 80 before falling a bit and petrol peaked at Rs 62.5. As the country's food price index rose 16.91 per cent, driven mainly by high vegetable prices, and the fuel price index climbed 11.53 per cent in 2010, the populace felt the heat.Like the rest of India, the residents of Assam, too, bore the brunt of unprecedented food price inflation. Increased prices burnt a hole into the budget of every household in the state. The skyrocketing prices even left those buffered with substantial family incomes reeling under their impact. So, one can imagine what they did to the subsistence-level and Below Poverty Line families in the state.Obviously, like people elsewhere in the country, citizens of Assam, too, blame the government for failing to control food prices. The masses including social groups, activists and common people took to the streets many times to voice their angst against the ruling government, but to no avail. The prices just kept rising.Now, with the assembly elections round the corner, the tables have turned and it's the people's chance to exercise their power. The mood in the state seems retaliative and voters feel they have finally got a chance to punch back at the government that turned a blind eye to their woes and complaints by using their supreme right of franchise and voting a capable government to power. ""The increased prices of essential commodities have not spared anyone in the state, rich or poor. Nowadays, even Rs 1,000 is not enough for the weekly grocery shopping of a family of four whereas earlier one could manage it in half the amount. Even though food prices have gone down in the last couple of months, the decrease is marginal and the rates show no signs of going down to earlier levels,"" said Sangeeta Hazarika, a city-based working woman.Even Generation X understands the implications of the unstoppable inflation. Harish, Varuna, Akashdeep, students of Commerce College in the city, expressed their worries over the price hike problem and said it would have a major impact on the outcome of the upcoming assembly polls. ""Most of us are fresh voters and we want a brave political leader with proper knowledge of economics. Only a leader with a sound idea of economics can make a blueprint to check price rise,"" they said.Political parties, on the other hand, in a bid to attract middle-class voters this time, are including price rise as a major issue in their poll manifestos. Former chief minister of Assam and AGP leader Prafulla Mahanta said, ""We have been constantly fighting against the ruling government which deliberately aided companies in increasing their product prices in return for monetary favours. Congress has cheated the common public with constant price hikes. This year's budget, too, clearly showed that the ruling government was not with the public as it didn't hesitate in increasing the prices of medicines and healthcare facilities. AGP will surely try to reverse the trend if given a chance.""CPM, too, has decided to wage its election war with price hike as one of its prime planks and party leader Uddhav Barman sang the same tune as Mahanta. ""We have been opposing the hike in prices of essential commodities for a long time. Prices of food items and petroleum products touched the sky and the ruling government did not do anything to contain them, causing great suffering to common people. CPM will surely take it up as a major issue this time,"" said Barman.The Left party also accused the Congress government of giving petroleum giants a free hand to increase their prices during its tenure. However, the members of All Guwahati Baboshay Samiti alleged all political parties of the state are out to cheat the public with false promises to curb inflation. ""All political parties are going to make price rise their main issue to lure voters. However, they are here for their own benefit. Once they come to power, they are all the same. We hope voters will choose their candidates on the basis of merit this time around,"" said Pranotosh Roy, president of the Samiti.It may be mentioned that Assam witnessed several bandhs during the last five years, most of them called by leading opposition parties AGP, CPM and BJP, while students groups blocked highways against the price hike."

They were given four chapatis and potato curry. They had no qualms about the food or the cramped lock up, the officer said.It also caused trouble in the medical examination and recording of their statement. We were here till late night, recording statements. We will interrogate them in batches as it will simplify the process, said Quaiser Khalid, deputy commissioner of police (Port Zone). The police confirmed that out of the 13 hostages, 12 belong to Mozambique and one to Indonesia.Representatives from both embassies have already taken them and they intend to house them in a hotel close by. We have instructed them not to leave the registered premises until the investigation is finished, said Khalid. While the Navy rescued 13 hostages, the police said 11 other hostages are still missing. According to one of the hostages, two Spanish hostages were left in Somalia, while two Indonesian hostages were killed. We are trying to determine where the remaining seven are, said Khalid.The Ballard Pier court on Thursday remanded six pirates to police custody till March 21. Police sources said that instead of asking for police custody of all the 61 pirates they sought the same (police custody) only for six of them.Due to logistical problems, we decided to ask for their custody in batches. Once we have investigated the first six, we will ask for the custody of the next batch, said Khalid.The Navy undertook a rescue operation on March 12, after they received communication from MV Vancouver Bridge that two skiffs were moving towards them.These skiffs were traced back to the pirate mother ship, Vega-5 a Mozambique fishing trawler, which had been hijacked in December 2010. The Navy apprehended 61 pirates and 13 hostages in the operation, who were handed over to Yellow Gate police station for further investigation."

In fact, stability in oil prices is currently the major concern in terms of economic and fiscal management.According to the WPI (wholesale price index) data, while the marginal moderation in food inflation was owing to a 9 per cent decline in potato prices and 3.05 per cent in pulses on a yearly basis, other items which continued to rule dearer were cereals by 3.88 per cent, rice by 2.75 per cent and wheat by 0.69 per cent, fruits prices by 19.39 per cent, milk by 7.16 per cent and eggs, meat and fish by 13.10 per cent.Alongside, prices of non-food articles went up by 23.03 per cent year-on-year.

This at a time, when the divisive forces are hell bent to destroy the secular fabric of the country.As the services of Indian Railways attracted people from almost every nook and corner of the country, the railway colonies have taken the shape of mini-India with people belonging to different states of the country and from varied backgrounds, culture and language residing in these colonies.Holi is the time, when people assemble together and celebrate the festival symbolising the symbiotic culture of the country.Logs of wood and branches of trees have been piled up at different points in the different railway colonies, which would be burned on the eve of Holi. These logs of woods can be found in the Loco Colony, Traffic Colony, GRP Colony, Lalitnagar Colony, Rajapur Colony, Subedarganj Colony and other railway colonies of the city.

But their joy has been short-lived as favourable weather conditions has led to a bumper yield in the other potato growing regions across India.According to the farmers,the increased supply has led to a fall in potato prices. A month ago,their crops fetched Rs 5-6 per kg which has now come down to Rs 4-5. The cold storages in Gujarat are full to capacity and there is no space to accommodate even a single bag.Banaskantha Potato Utpadak Sangh representative Babubhai Mali said the production in Deesa,among the biggest potato growing regions in the country,was 1.80 crore bags (each bag weighs 50kg) this season. But only 1.15 crore bags could be accommodated in 90 cold storages in Deesa and the nearby areas; the remaining 65 lakh bags are still lying in the fields,he said.The situation has compelled the farmers to go for distress sale. If they dont sell and keep the produce in the open fields,there is every likelihood of the produce getting spoiled. The temperature has already touched 40 degree Celsius. There has been a sharp decline in potato prices in Deesa, said Mali.Potato is grown over 30,000 hectares in Deesa. It produces some of the best quality potatoes,with an average per piece weight of 150 to 250 gms,which are mostly used by wafer manufacturers like Balaji,McKinsey and McDonalds.Regarding the state intervention to help the potato growers from this crisis,Banaskantha District Collector R J Patel said: We personally checked all the cold storages in the region,but they are all packed to capacity. We are assisting the farmers to transport the material to cold storages in Kheda and Nadiad districts.Gujarat Cold Storage Association president P C Chib said that even the cold storages in Kheda and Nadiad have no space to store any more potatoes.There is acute shortage of cold storages in the state. The crisis is going to deepen further with the growth in yield of other crops, he said.Chib said the state government needs to take some concrete measures to increase the storage capacity by building more cold storages in the private and public sectors. Most of the cold storages are in private sector,Chib added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Banaskantha is followed by Sabarkantha and Junagadh districts, says the statistical report of Gujarat Green Revolution Company Ltd (GGRC), a government of Gujarat undertaking, which was issued on the eve of World Water Day.Banaskantha collector R J Patel has congratulated the illiterate farmers of the district for their success in water harvesting. ""It is due to drip irrigation that Deesa has achieved a record production of 33 tonnes of potato per hectare as against last year's 28 tonnes. Efforts are on to popularise drip irrigation system in Vav, Danta and other backward areas in the district,"" Patel said.The total production by farmers has seen a noticeable rise after they began using the drip irrigation system.A potato grower of Rampura Vadali village in Amirgadh taluka of Banaskantha Ismail Rahimbhai Sheru claimed that ever since he adopted the system in 2005, his production has seen a two-fold increase. His potato output is now 50 tonnes from the earlier 30 tonnes per hectare.A farmer of Ghadiyal village in Vadagam taluka Bhikhabhai Chaudhari said drip irrigation besides helping in reducing the cost of labour and other inputs by Rs 20,000 per hectare, also helps in improving the fertility of the land. If you are using the new irrigation system, you can control flow of water and also moisture to some extent. This method also helps a farmer to maintain a check on fertiliser use."

In a move that will affect over four crore cable- and dish-TV subscribers in Mumbai and Maharashtra, the state government has proposed a 5% tax on the sale of copyrights of all entertainment and sports events to telecasting and distribution agencies.Industry experts predict that telecasters will have two options: increase on-air advertisement rates or pass on the burden to consumers.Sanjay Ghagare of Hathway Communications said: ""Surely such a tax will increase the overall costing in our business. With this 5% tax, the burden will fall on cable distributors, which will have to be passed on to consumers to recover the cost in order to make the business an affordable proposition."" Ravi Singh, one of the directors of Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), however, said advertising rates are likely to be impacted by the new tax, but that the cable and DTH industry will only be indirectly affected. ""The permission of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) will be required in order to change existing cable or DTH rates,"" he said.In many ways, the industry will be wading through uncharted territory as this is first time the government has decided to tax copyrights for major programmes and events. In the current model, channels and telecasting agencies purchase copyrights to serials, live events, etc and earn revenue from advertisements and viewers via cable or DTH providers.Finance minister Ajit Pawar in his budget speech said the turnover of sale of telecasting rights of various events is a significant area from the revenue perspective. ""The telecasting rights of various entertainment and sports events are intangible goods. I propose to include this in the list of goods of intangible nature,"" he said even as the Opposition vociferously denounced the move.The Rajasthan government withdrew this tax in 2011 just one year after introducing it. ""If the Congress government in other states is withdrawing it, the Maharashtra government should rethink its stand,"" said Ghagare."

However, wheat prices remained unchanged year-on-year.Meanwhile, non-food inflation was up by 26.18 per cent year-on-year.Mineral prices were up by 12.35 per cent during the week under review, while petrol became dearer by 23.14 per cent.Headline inflation in the country has remained above 8 per cent since February, 2010.

Alongside, while prices of fruits surged 24.67 per cent, eggs, meat and fish were 15.34 per cent costlier on a yearly basis.Base effect helpsEvidently, apart from the statistical anomaly of base effect which tends to provide relief from high prices only on paper and not to pockets, the government will have to undertake some more administrative measures to contain rising food prices as mere tinkering with key policy rates by the Reserve Bank of India is unlikely to yield the desired results.Since March 2010, the RBI has raised its policy rates eight times to contain headline inflation, but it is common knowledge that food inflation is on account of mismatches in supply and demand.According to the WPI food inflation data, milk turned dearer by 5.79 per cent on a yearly basis and barring wheat, which remained unchanged, other items also ruled higher with cereals costlier by 3.96 per cent and rice by 2.94 per cent."
113,Farmers find leasing out land to ginger growers profitable,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/Farmers-find-leasing-out-land-to-ginger-growers-profitable/article14666312.ece,2011-04-01,The Hindu,"For Narasamma, a farmer from Dasanakoplu near here, leasing out her land to ginger growers is more profitable than venturing into farming. She has leased out two acres of land to ginger growers from Kerala at the rate of Rs. 45,000 an acre per year.Similarly, hundreds of potato farmers in the district have leased out their land to outsiders after their crop was hit by late blight in the past few years.Ms. Narasamma said her family members preferred to hand over the land on lease as they were sure of getting an assured sum at the end of the year. Also, there was no need to look after the crop every day. I get Rs. 45,000 an acre per year. And, the lessee pays another Rs. 50,000 for using the borewell water, she said.Potato is a traditional crop here. Hundreds of farmers had suffered losses after their crop was infected by late blight. The estimated loss since 2008 is Rs. 230 crore, according to the Agriculture Department.Best alternativeContinuing loss of crop prompted farmers to look for alternative crops. Many found ginger as the best alternative. However, we can't say that cultivation of potato has come down drastically before conducting a detailed ground survey, Nagaraj, Deputy Director of Horticulture, said. According to Mr. Nagaraj, till mid-March, ginger had been sown in about 45,000 hectares in the district. By April-end, it will be extended to another 15,000 hectares. Last year, ginger was cultivated in 45,000 hectares.Bobby, an agricultural worker from Kalpetta in Kerala, is among the three who are working on 7 acres of land taken on lease at Dasanakoplu. He is working for a Kerala-based farmer . If the yield is good, the returns will be a minimum of Rs. 1.5 lakh per acre in a year, he said.However, these growers keep moving from one place to another as ginger is not meant to be cultivated on a particular land every year. The yield is good in the first year. It sucks nutrients from the soil to the maximum level. Farmers will have to grow ragi or jowar for the next couple of years for the soil to regain fertility, Mr. Bobby said."

Individuals across the city and around it are taking it onto themselves to develop wastelands into cultivated patches with exotic flowers , fruits , vegetables , and even , medicinal shrubs . With no grant or sanction from the authorities , these green workers often run into trouble , but what keeps them going is the satisfaction of sprucing up their neighbourhood . So , the next time you see cauliflowers , tomatoes , potatoes , guavas , and even , strawberries growing on the roadside , remember it's the personal effort of these housewives that has come to fruition .Take the case of 75-year-old Sudershan Khanna . The open land behind her house in Vasant Vihar's Poorvi Apartments was once infected with termites and wild bushes were seen in profusion . The wasteland on another side was a blot on the landscape with heaps of garbage being added to it every day . ""I got hold of a few labourers , hired trucks , and got the land cleared of garbage , and even , carcasses of animals , as the place would stink . Finally , the dhalao was dismantled and I got the area treated with pesticides . Levelling the backyard was also a challenge ,"" said Khanna .""It was peak summer and people would think I'm mad . But the satisfaction I derived from doing this was unmatched ,"" she said . That was almost a decade ago . Today , she has more than 500 potted plants , cauliflowers , tomatoes , brinjals , pomegranates and exotic flowers growing in her backyard . There are four shelves full of trophies garnered by her for putting the wasteland to good use. But she also faces many hurdles . ""The other day someone had put acid on my China Orange plant . Earlier in the week, I found my water hose cut into small pieces ,"" said Khanna.Khanna and the others like her say it's their love for nature that makes them take on laidback authorities . Cynics term it one of the exploits of the rich but for these individuals it's a way of giving back to the community , while pursuing gardening as a hobby . ""We have a temple in the colony which had a large wasteland around it till two years ago . The residents wanted to transform it but nothing worked out. I then took up the challenge and worked on it for eight months . I ended up spending at least Rs 2 lakh as I had to remove the garbage , level the surface , plant trees , shrubs and creepers, and buy manure ,"" said 58-year-old Krishna Gupta from Madhuban near Preet Vihar .She has now planted flowers, palm , banana , amla , auspicious trees like kalpvriksh and bel patra and nearly 100 bougainvilleas.""People visiting the temple use them for puja . This place used to stink before and often outlaws hid here . But now residents sit here in the evenings and during winters too,"" said Krishna . Neera Kapur Wadhwa , who transformed another garbage dump near her house in Noida's sector 29 , added , ""We expect the authorities to do everything . I tried to convince my neighbours that we should work on the wasteland but nobody agreed . Then I went ahead on my own.""For 66-year-old Shakuntla Aggarwal and daughter-in-law , Nina , in Khel Gaon , the wasteland outside their house has been a platform to spread awareness about medicinal plants . They have Asthalin used by asthma patients and gilloi to treat swine flu and dengue besides brahmi , aloevera , peppermint , lemon grass , and oregano . ""Often , neighbours ask us for a branch of any of these plants as they know the significance now , "" says her husband J P Aggarwal , proudly .On a mission: Small wastelands inside colonies or on the roadside are barren or bushy spaces which mostly turn into dumping ground for residents These are often overlooked by authorities for their small size and little utility But residents, specially housewives, are taking it upon themselves to transform these wastelands From growing fruits and vegetables to seasonal and exotic flowers, these green workers ensure that no corner in their colony raises a stink The women work on the wastelands without any grant from the authorities or RWAs. The cost depends on the size of wasteland, the plants being used, and labour charges. It can go up to 2-3 lakh with a monthly maintenance cost of up to 5,000."

Four parks have not commenced commercial operation till date and the farmers continued to suffer for want of industries to process vegetables such as onion, tomato, potato and fruits during glut period.Financial aid lostThe State Government lost the possibility of Central financial aid of Rs. 8 crore for establishing two parks at Malur, as the administration in the parks had failed to identify the land for the project and find means of finance by obtaining term loan from the banks. The joint venture for the park at Belgaum had been cancelled as it had neither paid the land cost nor tied up means of finance.The Food Karnataka Limited has cancelled both the joint ventures.Strangely, the Food Karnataka, which earned interest of Rs. 2.96 crore on the government grants, paid Rs. 65.10 lakh as income tax thinking it as income. The CAG said that the amount should have been added back to the principal amount of grants and avoided the tax. He also termed it a financial irregularity. But, the company argued that the interest was revenue, as the government had not specified any conditions before releasing the funds as to its utilisation.The Union Ministry for Food Processing Industry had asked the company to return the money and also dubbed its decision to treat the interest as profit and paying income tax accordingly as financial irregularity. The money should have been returned to the Government, it opined. It struck down the company's argument that the money was utilised for meeting administrative expenditure as inadmissible."

The rate of price rise during the week ended March 26 was the lowest since the week ending November 27, 2010, when it was recorded at 8.69 per cent.Although good crop production will keep food inflation low, experts fear that spiralling prices of crude oil in the international market could cast a shadow on the overall price situation.The prices of pulses declined by 5.39 per cent during the reporting week, while other food items like rice, wheat and milk recorded modest increases.Items like fruits and vegetables, however, continued to remain dear.""With a record output projected for this year, we believe food inflation will remain moderate in the next few months,"" Crisil chief economist DK Joshi said.The government had yesterday said that India's foodgrains production is estimated at a record 235.88 million tonnes in the 2010-11 crop year, ending June, on the back of the highest-ever output of wheat and pulses.""While prices of vegetables and fruits would continue to display some volatility, reflecting their perishable nature, prices of cereals and pulses may show a mild decline in the coming weeks. Overall, a favourable base effect is expected to aid a decline in food inflation in the coming weeks,"" ICRA Economist Aditi Nayar said.Food inflation was in double digits for most of the last fiscal. However, it has shown signs of slight moderation since the last week of February and this is the second consecutive week when it was a single-digit figure.The government had earlier said that rising food prices were one of the major reasons for overall inflation remaining high. Headline inflation was 8.31 per cent in February.The Reserve Bank had last month revised its inflation projection for March-end upward to 8 per cent from the earlier 7 per cent.Experts, however, said that higher prices of other commodities, primarily crude oil, may continue to cast a shadow on the overall inflation situation.""It is a cause of concern that the overall inflation situation remains largely sluggish. Besides food inflation, which continues to gradually soften and hold below 10 per cent, inflation on primary articles and fuel and power have not moderated,"" Deloitte, Haskin & Sells director Anis Chakravarty said.Concurring with the view, Joshi said that current high crude prices may spoil the expectation of lower food prices curbing inflationary pressure.""Overall inflation is likely to remain higher than the comfort level of policy-makers. The global crude prices have to be carefully watched,"" Joshi said.Ongoing political turmoil in Libya, close on the heels of similar unrest in Egypt, Tunisia and Bahrain, has pushed international crude prices to over $100 per barrel.While pulses reported a decline during the week under review, the trend was the opposite for other items.Fruits became dearer by 25.40 per cent year-on-year, while eggs, meat and fish became 12.80 per cent more expensive during the week under review. Milk was also up by 3.87 per cent.On an annual basis, cereals became dearer by 3.62 per cent, while rice and wheat were up by 2.08 per cent and 0.29 per cent, respectively.Vegetables were up by 11.41 per cent. Potatoes became 5.30 per cent costlier and onion prices went up by 8.48 per cent.During the week under review, inflation in non-food articles was 27.56 per cent. Fibres became dearer by 86.90 per cent, while fuel and power was up by 13.13 per cent.Petrol became dearer by 23.14 per cent on an annual basis.ICRA's Nayar said the decline in prices of pulses was offset by an increase in the prices of vegetables, fruits, and protein-based items."

118,Deeply Unfair,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110411/jsp/opinion/story_13812499.jsp,2011-04-11,Telegraph,"Why is Indias future brighter than Chinas, especially in a warming world? Because India has more good agricultural land per person. That will get more and more important as the temperature goes up. I first encountered the concept of Real Population Density (note the Real) when I was interviewing people in the Netherlands last year about how the country would fare as the temperature rose. My initial focus was on sea-level rise, because 20 per cent of the country is already below sea level. But the Dutch are confident that they have the sea-level problem under control. The Dutch sea-level experts were also confident that the Netherlands would not face any problem with food when the temperature rises. The country is, after all, the second or third biggest agricultural exporter in the world. But it still feels like a very crowded country, so I looked up a few agricultural experts, and they explained the concept of Real Population Density to me. It would take a country three or four times the size of the Netherlands to support our present diet, said Dr Huib Silvis of the Agricultural Economics Research Institute at Wageningen University. We import huge amounts of soybean and other animal feed, which we could not produce ourselves. If we had to be self-sufficient, we would not be eating meat. The Real Population Density of the Netherlands how many people there are per square kilometre of farmland  is 2,205. Thats higher than Bangladesh, and it means that the Netherlands, to be self-sufficient in food, would have to feed 22 people from each hectare of land. So how can the country be the second- or third-biggest agricultural exporter in the world? Because thats the cash value of its exports, which are mostly high value-added products. You get a lot more for a tonne of cut flowers than you do for a tonne of potatoes  but you cant eat cut flowers, and the Dutch could barely feed themselves from their own resources. New lottery Global warming makes matters much worse, because it hits food production very hard. The rule of thumb is that the world loses about ten per cent of its food production for every rise of one degree Celsius in average global temperature. So the amount of food that is for sale on the international market drops drastically, because some of the big food-exporting countries are not producing enough food to export it any more. As the food gets scarce, the price goes up. Countries that cannot feed themselves either pay huge amounts to buy the limited amount of food that is still available on the international market, or else go hungry. Which brings us back to India and China. Almost half the total land area of India is good arable land, whereas only 15 per cent of China is. So although China looks bigger on the map, India has a significantly lower Real Population Density: 753 people per sq km of farmland compared to 943 for China. Add in the fact that China is currently losing about 1 per cent of its arable land per year to buildings, roads and parking lots, and the numbers for China start looking seriously bad. At the other end of the spectrum, look at the big industrialized states in Europe. Italy and Germany are in the 700s, but Spain, France, Sweden and Poland are all in the 300s. The lucky ones still have room to grow; the others dont. And the uncontested winners in this new lottery? The United States of America has only 179 people per sq km of good agricultural land. Russia has 117. Canada is 78, and Australia is 43. Australia, in other words, has more than half a hectare of good land per person. This is deeply unfair, given which countries are actually responsible for the global warming. To them that hath, shall it be given. But then, you already knew that the universe isnt fair."

Photo: K.V.Srinivasan: Vegetable prices, which made a big dent in household budgets until a few weeks ago, have dropped drastically, much to the delight of the residents.Customers who were spending frugally on vegetables owing to their cost now shop generously for their favourite items. Karthika Selvakumar, a resident of Chitlapakkam, said Until early March, I used to spend Rs.150-Rs.200 on vegetables for four days. Now, I am able to purchase the same quantity within Rs.100. I have once again started including lady's fingers and drumsticks in my daily menu.According to wholesale traders in Koyambedu market, most vegetables are usually priced less during summer owing to more arrivals.

121,Hill-plain divide in snack sales ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110419/jsp/nation/story_13872725.jsp,2011-04-19,Telegraph,"Anand Gupta sells alur dum in his shop in Darjeeling on Monday. (Suman Tamang) Dharmendra Choudhury grins as he stirs the tamarind water in the large earthen pot on his cart. Elections help sell my phuchkas, the 14-year-old Siliguri boy says, gazing happily at the long queues before the booths at Margaret School. Poll heat or the rising mercury, nothing can keep business away from phuchkawallas, he adds with an air of wisdom. We leave even the dabwallas (sellers of green-coconut water) behind on a hot day. Up in the hills, Anand Gupta casts a mournful look at his tub of alur dum (potato curry). Business has been bad today. For every Rs 5 that I earn on a normal day, I guess I will make less than Rs 2 today, says the 28-year-old eatery owner. Yet his shop in Darjeelings S.M. Das Road is located near two polling stations, the Nepali Girls Higher Secondary School and the Municipal Girls High School. Call it the hills-plains divide in election-day business. The explanation seems to be that the voters at the Darjeeling booths are all from the neighbourhood. Arriving from distances less than a kilometre, none seems hungry or interested in eating out. Its not clear how far the voters are coming from in Siliguri, but Dharmendras brisk sales may have to do with the plains hotter climate and the enduring popularity of the phuchka, a light snack one can taste even if one is not hungry. The boy parks his cart near the school on most days anyway, but today his father left him specific orders to man the booth while he himself scouted for business nearby. On an average school day I sell around 100-150 pieces; today I have come with 400 pieces. Each costs one rupee, Dharmendra says. An unexpected customer turns up: a police constable. I hadnt expected him, you see, the boy whispers. I thought only voters would come. But now I feel Ill make better sales than I thought. Its only 11am; I think more policemen will come. Some 5,000 voters are expected at this booth. Dharmendra has never heard of the candidates, Asok Bhattacharya and Rudranath Bhattacharya, but he has heard of the CPM and the Trinamul Congress. One has a red flag and the other a flower and grass, he says shyly. He has an afterthought: I have heard that the results will be declared from Siliguri College sometime next month. On that day, Ill go there with my cart. In Darjeeling, the crowds are passing by Guptas shop without a glance and heading towards the booth. I make a profit of about Rs 1,000 on a normal day but there is no hope today. I shall close my shop in the afternoon. After all, I have to cast my vote too, he said. On most other days, long queues form for his hot alur dum  especially on cold, rainy afternoons  and Gupta can hardly catch his breath. The dish consists of three or four pieces of potato in thick gravy, served with crunchy potato chips, fried noodles and roasted maize. Price: Rs 5 a plate. Gupta isnt the only one to lose business today. Less than one in 20 shops has opened in Darjeeling Market, and the whole of Judge Bazaar and Chowk Bazaar are shut along with the flea markets dotting Nehru Road.

122,State seeks 24.65 lakh tonnes of nutrients for kharif season,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/State-seeks-24.65-lakh-tonnes-of-nutrients-for-kharif-season/article14698418.ece,2011-04-27,The Hindu,"To avert a crisis in the supply of fertilizers to farmers, the State Government has asked the Union Government to ensure supply of 24.65 lakh tonnes of nutrients during the kharif season.With pre-monsoon showers lashing the State, farmers have commenced sowing of pulses, oilseeds, maize, cotton and potato in Chamarajanagar, Mysore, Hassan, Chikmagalur, Dharwad, Bijapur, Belgaum and Haveri districts.Following the increased demand for fertilizers, Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa has urged Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers M.K. Alagiri to ensure adequate supply of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) to the State during the kharif 2011.The Union Government has allocated 6.15 lakh tonnes of DAP, 2.90 lakh tonnes of muriate of potash (MOP), 6.30 lakh tonnes of NPK and eight lakh tonnes of urea to the State for kharif 2011.Officials in the Agriculture Department said that a detailed plan on the requirement of different varieties of fertilizers during the kharif season had been submitted to the Union Ministry for Agriculture and Union Ministry for Chemicals and Fertilizers.The officials said that the State required 2.10 lakh tonnes of nutrients, 2.65 lakh tonnes, 4.36 lakh tonnes, 5.14 lakh tonnes, 5.16 lakh tonnes and 5.21 lakh tonnes of nutrients in April, May, June, July, August and September, respectively. Though the Union Government has allocated fertilizers to the State every month based on the requirement, there has been short supply, particularly DAP. The supply of DAP was 1,57,895 tonnes against the allocation of 2,48,910 tonnes during the last four months. The actual requirement of the State was 1.80 lakh tonnes.For instance, in December last the Union Government supplied 33,507 tonnes of DAP against the allocation of 43000 tonnes. The allocation in January, February and March was 85,150, 83,300 and 37,460 tonnes while the supply was 57,827 tonnes, 45,949 tonnes and 20,612 tonnes, respectively, the officials said.The requirement of DAP for pulses and other horticultural crops such as coffee, arecanut, coconut was essential during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. It has come to my notice through the Department of Agriculture that the indigenous production of DAP and also importing of DAP have not taken place due to escalation in the cost of phosphoric acid in the international market and non-finalisation of the fertilizer import policy, the Chief Minister has said in his letter to the Union Government. Due to shortfall in the supply of DAP, the farmers have not been supplied the required quantity of fertilizers in time. Continued short supply will create panic among farmers and may lead to law and order problems, Mr. Yeddyurappa has said.The Union Government was urged to give more allocation to the fertilizer manufacturers/importers capable of supplying fertilizers as per allocation.TargetThe department has set a sowing target of 74 lakh hectares during kharif 2011. It has set a target of producing 140 lakh tonnes of foodgrains during the kharif, rabi and summer crop seasons of 2011-12.The States have also been asked to keep a strict vigil on diversion of fertilizers for non-agricultural uses.There are about 78 lakh farmers in the State. About eight lakh tonnes of seeds of different crops will be required during the kharif season."

The island nation, which was a hot potato for terror insurers, has seen risk premium fall significantly since thenafter the elimination of LTTE kingpin V Prabhakaran.While the market is positive over the medium-term impact, there is some nervousness over possible retaliatory attacks.""I would say that the insurance markets would wait a few months to see whether this leads to the dismantling of the structures required for organized terror,"" said Praveen Vashista, MD of Howden India Insurance Brokers which also helps insure risks in Sri Lanka. He added that the structures included training, information, and finance networks. Vashishta said that while LTTE's rout had brought down insurance rates in the island, al-Qaida is a different organization. ""It is a faceless, borderless organization. The impact of the killing on its terror activities will be a function of the kind of succession planning in al-Qaida,"" he said. ""In international markets, we have not seen any reaction because of this risk alert. It is too early to comment on the impact,"" said Sanjay Kedia, MD, Marsh India Insurance Brokers. He pointed out that for policies where the insured amount is upto Rs 750 crore, the rates are fixed by Indian terror insurance pool managed by GIC and rates do not change in line with international markets.According to the CEO of an insurance company, there is reason to be cautious. ""The US President has warned of attacks. We are hearing of advisories being issued by countries in the West. Strategic affairs experts have warned of a ditry bomb being used by al-Qaida should its chief be killed,"" he said.Insurers say that following the Mumbai attacks there has been a lull in terror activities and the terror rates had fallen to such an extent that recent months had seen a correction.But insurers continue to be very sensitive to large risks in areas which are seen to be susceptible to terror attacks. Iconic buildings and energy installations which are high value and seen as high risks usually end up paying a higher price because of this risk perception."

Once the city of just jhal muri (puffed rice mixed with other ingredients), phuchka (golgappa), singara (samosa), kachauri and telebhaja (oil fries), street food graduated to hot kathi rolls (kebabs rolled in a paratha) and mughlai paratha (paratha with potato filling laced with egg) in the 1960s.Sometime during the 1980s, chowmein (mixed noodles) turned into a favourite street food with kiosks and carts mushrooming in nearly every locality. Around that time, Kolkata adopted paw bhaji, a favourite Maharashtrian dish that is extremely popular in Mumbai.As influx of migrant population increased, pice hotels sprung up, serving maach-bhaat (fish and rice) around various localities. The substantial meal is still sold at extremely affordable rates ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 15. Around the same time, south Indian fare comprising dosa, idli and vada became popular. These were followed by chola-bhatura and kulcha-chana.At the turn of the millennium, more exotic dishes were added to the street food platter. Momo (dumplings) and thupka (noodle soup) is now a major hit and sold on streets across the city. Biryani, that was available only in restaurants, has also become a regular fare in streets, particularly in office paras (localities) like BBD Bag and Camac Street.While one can taste these delectables dishes all over the city, the kiosks along Decker's Lane is the ultimate destination for foodies. Located smack in the middle of the central business district, one can bite into a myriad variety of disheschicken cutlet, fish fry, fish roll, mutton/chicken/vegetable stew, ghugni, chowmein, fried rice, chilly/schezwan/garlic chicken, luchi/puri sabzi, chola-bhatura, kulcha-chana, momo, biryani, a wide range of sweets, lassi, firni and lots more.Just in case, there is doubt about the quality of food, the World Health Organization has in a survey, certified the food sold on Decker's Lane in Kolkata as among the best street food available anywhere."

129,Air-tight packets to boost litchi sales,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110511/jsp/bihar/story_13963992.jsp,2011-05-11,Telegraph,"Scientist SK Purbe instructs the farmers on litchi preservation techniques in Muzaffarpur. Picture by Prakash Kumar Muzaffarpur, May 10: Famous litchis of north Bihar will be up for sale in nitrogen packets, much like packets of potato chips, in an attempt to increase its shelf life. United Nations representative for food and agriculture wing Danilo Mejio was in Muzaffarpur to boost the market demand of the succulent fruits of north Bihar. The farmers and litchi growers are being trained to adopt a scientific method of packing the fruit, to help command high prices in the market. Mejio, along with the director of National Litchi Research Institute, Vishal Nath and scientist S.K. Purbe, organised an interactive session on Monday evening with a group of litchi farmers to guide them on how to preserve the fruit in an air-tight pack that would help increase the shelf life of the fruit. Traditional growers and cultivators have been taught tips to treat the fruit after harvest. Suggestions were also given on the harvest and handling of the fruit post-harvest. Mejio said there has been an increase in the demand of the fruit from north Bihar, not only from various parts of the country, but also abroad where the demand has been soaring day by day. Qualitative production and better management of plucking it from the trees could increase the longevity of litchi. It should be plucked as advised to the farmers by keeping a long stem, lessening the potential of hydrogen and wiping out the fungus threat. This will help retain the pink colour of the skin and full tight shape of the fruit for more hours after plucking, he said. Farmers have been requested to adopt the technology of keeping a bunch of litchis in polythene packets, which are filled with oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This would certainly increase the shelf life of the perishable products for a period of at least 45 hours, Mejio said. Speaking to The Telegraph, Mejio said the marketability of litchis in the state is not fit and it requires a boost to give the maximum return to the growers. Shelf life of the fruit produced here is also very short. Since litchi is a highly perishable fruit, experts are burning the midnight oil to convince the farmers to embrace scientific poly packing. If the farmers go for a nitrogen pack, they will make huge profits. It is high time to popularise the technology of this system and the institute has launched measures to popularise the poly pack of litchi, Mejio said. He added that a team of scientists from National Litchi Research Institute, Mushahri headed by Nath and Purbe would make a whirlwind tour of the litchi-producing districts and regions to impress upon the growers hailing from far-flung districts of north Bihar, including Samastipur, Khagaria, Bhagalpur, Katihar, Vaishali, Sitamarhi, East Champaran and West Champaran, to choose and use the scientific technology of poly packing with nitrogen gas."

Cereals became dearer by 4.54 per cent, while fruits prices were up by over 35 per cent on an annual basis.Milk was also costlier by 4.3 per cent in the week ended April 30 compared to the corresponding seven-day period last year. Eggs, meat and fish were also up by 4.62 per cent.The data further showed that inflation in non-food primary articles was 28.62 per cent during the week under review.Fibre prices rose by almost 86 per cent and minerals by 11.95 per cent.Early this month, the RBI had increased borrowing rates by 50 basis points to curb demand and control inflation. The food segment contributes almost 15 per cent in the WPI.Headline or overall inflation stood at 8.98 per cent in March, which is above the government's comfort zone.In the monetary policy, the RBI said that overall inflation is likely remain in the range of 9 per cent during the first half of fiscal 2011-12, but is expected moderate to around 6 per cent by the year end."

However, there are concerns on price momentum in non-food articles.Even as prices of pulses eased by 9.05 per cent, vegetables by 3.64 per cent and potatoes by 3.58 per cent on a year-on-year basis, Mr. Mukherjee pointed to the prime cause for concern and said: Sustained high non-food primary prices are creating cost-push inflationary conditions in the manufacturing sector. Thus, even though food inflation is declining, the concern on higher core inflation remains. The Finance Minister, however, hoped that the hike in key policy rates by the RBI would help in containing the inflationary spiral, which has been shifting food to non-food items."

Besides, the marginal drop in inflation has taken place even as prices of manufactured products and fuel and power have shown upward trend.The impact of recent petrol price hike on inflation will be known only when the inflation data for May will be out. Analysts say the marginal drop in inflation level as noticed in April will be short lived if the government makes an upward revision in retail prices of three other mass consumed products likediesel, domestic cooking gas (LPG) and kerosenein the face of rise in global crude oil prices.Comparatively the overall inflation in April appears to be low when compared with the revised figure in March. The overall inflation, as measured on the basis of the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), now stands revised to 9.04 per cent for March from the original projection of 8.98 per cent.As the government explains the revision was carried out as metal products were not incorporated earlier due to a programming error. Despite marginal decline the overall inflation at less than 9 per cent continues to stand at high level compared to tolerable limit of 5 to 6 per cent prescribed by the Reserve Bank.In fact, the RBI in its monetary policy for 2011-12 has projected that inflationary pressure would continue to sustain for some more months before moderating to around 6 per cent by March, 2012. The Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee while remaining cautious on movement of inflation in coming months said the April prices had come down both on manufacturing sector and the food sector. This is a good trend and if it continues then perhaps it will be more moderate.Analysis of data shows the prices of primary articles -- food, non-food articles and minerals  went up by 12.05 per cent on an annual basis. While food items shot up by 8.71 per cent, non-food primary articles rose by over 27 per cent.As far as price movement of key vegetables is concerned onion was cheaper by 6.37 per cent on an annual basis while potatoes became less expensive by 0.54 per cent. During April fuel and power prices went up by 13.32 per cent. Keeping the pressure on overall inflation the manufactured goods group index rose by 6.18 per cent on an annual basis. Manufactured items have the highest weight of 64.9 per cent in the WPI."

The farmers didnt associate much importance to this advice by the government and continued sowing potato seeds. However, some farmers had switched over to alternate crops like ginger and maize this year.Sources in the Department of Agriculture informed that ginger and maize will fetch good price for farmers in the agricultural market and the department is encouraging farmers to grow ginger, maize in large scale instead of potato.Distribution centresThe Department had already opened potato seeds distribution centres from May 9 and about 1,17,259 quintal of potato seeds had been distributed so far.Rain lashed the district on Tuesday and brought smile on the face of farmers.Speaking to Deccan Herald, Deputy Director of Horticulture Nagaraj said that potato seeds were sown in 12,000 hectare of land in the district last year. The potato growers had decided to sow potato seeds in 11,000 hectare of lands this year. However, the exact area of sowing the seeds will be known by June 15 when sowing activity reaches a stage of completion.The farmers had also sown turmeric in some parts of the district.

135,Buying startups in the race for talent,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/164051/buying-startups-race-talent.html,2011-05-26,Deccan Herald,"Last updated: 26 May, 2011By Miguel Helft, The New York Times: 21:43 ISTSam Lessin sold his web startup to Facebook for millions last year, and Facebook promptly shut it down. All Facebook wanted was Lessin.That is what it has come to in bubbly Silicon Valley. Companies like Facebook, Google and Zynga are so hungry for the best talent that they are buying startups to get their founders and engineers  and then jettisoning their products. Some technology blogs call it being acqhired. The companies doing the buying say it is a talent acquisition, and it typically comes with a price per head.Engineers are worth half a million to 1 million, said Vaughan Smith, Facebooks director of corporate development, who has helped negotiate many of the 20 or so talent acquisitions made by Facebook in the past four years.The money  in the form of stock  is often distributed among the startups founders, employees and investors. The acqhired employees also get a rich salary and often more stock options, which makes this a good time for entrepreneurial engineers.Lessin, who is 27, happily traded his dream of becoming the next internet superstar for a prominent job with Facebook. The impact here is astronomical, said Lessin, whose startup was called Drop.io. Its awesome.But the deals may not be so good for everyone. Some Silicon Valley veterans fear that companies are overpaying for talent and that some of the acquired employees will defect as soon as they can, perhaps because they will get restless in a corporate environment. And venture capitalists, who hope for windfalls that can be measured in the tens or hundreds of millions if not more, will only grudgingly settle for less.It is not what we are aiming for as investors, said Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a venture fund. We are trying to build large, lasting businesses.Still, McClure and other investors said a talent acquisition that offers a modest payoff is better than no deal at all if a startup sputters. And while a sale for a few million will not make or break their funds, it could amount to a tidy sum for an engineer just out of college, they said.Who are we to tell a young entrepreneur that they cant have their first million? said Paul Graham, a partner at Y Combinator, a well-known incubator that has invested in hundreds of startups.The talent acquisitions are a reflection of the most competitive market for computer whiz kids in more than a decade. Big companies like Google and tiny startups complain that they cannot find enough good people. They are dangling new perks and incentives, from free iPads to lessons in entrepreneurship, to lure them.The war for talent has gotten even hotter, said Scott Dettmer, a lawyer who has advised technology companies for decades. And this is another vehicle to satisfy the insatiable quest for talent.Perhaps no one has jumped on the trend more enthusiastically than Facebook, which has bought a string of small startups with names like Parakey, Hot Potato and Octazen. Almost all their products have been killed. In 2009, Facebook bought FriendFeed, a service to help people track the online activities of their friends. Tech insiders thought it was trying to compete more effectively with Twitter. But Facebook was really after FriendFeeds dozen well-regarded product managers and engineers, including two of its founders, Bret Taylor and Paul Buchheit, who had also worked at Google.We really wanted to get Bret, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks chief executive, said in an interview last year.While the FriendFeed service remains available, it has received no upgrades or new features. Of the 12 employees who joined Facebook, eight remain, and Taylor is its chief technology officer. Buchheit, best known for creating Gmail, has left.Neither the acquired nor the acquirers like to talk numbers. But the acquisitions are generally in stock, and employees typically must wait a year or more before they can sell their shares. Facebook says the deals are worth it because the company needs creative entrepreneurs who can also help keep Facebooks startup culture alive.The measure of how well these works for us is that the CEO of every acquisition weve ever done is still employed at the company, Smith said.But the size of some deals is raising eyebrows.It was widely reported that FriendFeed was bought for about $47 million, or about $4 million for each employee, although some money went to its outside investors. When Facebook bought Drop.io for an undisclosed sum, only Lessin, a friend of Zuckerbergs since college, joined Facebook. He is now in charge of user profile pages.Facebook paid a few million dollars for Drop.io, according to people briefed on the deal who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the terms of the deal were confidential. Facebook declined to comment on the prices it paid.Some per capita values seem hard to justify, said Randy Komisar, a longtime venture investor. But there is not a lot of proven talent in areas like social networking that are battlefields for todays companies. People will look back and realise that they overpaid in some cases. But in the heat of the moment, they may not feel they have a lot of options.In the interview last year, Zuckerberg suggested that paying top dollar for people like Taylor and his colleagues at FriendFeed was justified. Someone who is exceptional in their role is not just a little better than someone who is pretty good, he said. They are 100 times better.Other companies are more circumspect about their strategies.Google declined to be interviewed on the topic. In a statement, it played down its involvement, saying that even if a service from an acquired company was shut down, its ideas often surfaced later in Google products.Zynga said it bought 12 companies in the last year, and an unspecified number of those were for talent. One was Area/Code, a gaming studio in New York with 20 employees. While it kept one of Area/Codes mobile games, Drop7, Zynga said it bought the company largely for the design expertise of its employees.At a recent networking event for startups in Silicon Valley, many entrepreneurs talked about possible deals. Alexander Moore, who is 27, said he had never heard about talent acquisitions when he started Baydin, which helps people organise their e-mail inboxes, in Boston in 2009.He has since relocated his three-person startup to Silicon Valley. Here its happening all the time, he said, and its something wed definitely consider."
136,HPL plans 3 polymer clusters in Bengal ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110531/jsp/business/story_14051690.jsp,2011-05-31,Telegraph,"Purnendu Chatterjee in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury Calcutta, May 30: Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) today proposed three polymer parks in Bengal and devised a marketing strategy to beat the vagaries of the commodity cycle. HPL vice-chairman Purnendu Chatterjee said the company had initiated talks with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation on parks in Haldia, Panagarh and Kharagpur. Spread across 100 acres, each park will be dotted with units making plastic products from polymer granules Haldia manufactures as well as value-added chemical products. Haldia sells only 20 per cent of its product in the eastern region. We want this to go up to 50 per cent, Chatterjee said. The WBIDC and the Haldia Development Authority possess the land for the parks. The company expects the move to increase profitability. It has to compete with big players such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Indian Oil Corporation and Gail (India) Ltd in their home turfs (west and north India), resulting in meagre earnings as transportation cost eats into the profit. HPL will provide the common testing facility helping entrepreneurs with the know- how for the units. It will set up warehouses to store products so that small units can buy when they need to reduce their working capital. Marketing push The company also unveiled a new marketing initiative today. Instead of only driving volume, it plans to create a new line of products used in agriculture. HPL will try out shade nets (paan baroz) to be used in betel leaf cultivation, potato sacks and rice bowl (dhaan gola). It also hopes to make products to be used in drip irrigation, safe drinking water and fish packaging. We may get some price protection and improve the netbacks (profits), Chatterjee said. These initiatives are part of the companys strategy to increase the use of HPLs products  polymer and chemicals  in Bengal. So far, 763 downstream units have come up for HPL, employing over 2 lakh people directly and indirectly. Managing director Partha S. Bhattacharyya said the new initiative would create jobs in the state. The state will benefit in two ways. There will be jobs and correspondingly economic prosperity. It will also benefit HPL and since the state is a shareholder, it will be rewarded, too."

The rate of price rise of food items was as high as 21.15 per cent in the third week of May, 2010.As per data released by government today, prices of pulses were down by 9.22 per cent year-on-year, while wheat became cheaper by 0.77 per cent.This seems to be a reflection of the record production of wheat and pulses during the 2010-11 crop year (July-June).During the week under review, prices of vegetables overall were down by 1.06 per cent on an annual basis, while potatoes became cheaper by 2.15 per cent.However, prices of other food items became more expensive. Fruits were up by 30.51 per cent and onions by 12.32 per cent year-on-year.Protein-based item also continued on their recent upward trend, with milk prices becoming dearer by 7.04 per cent and eggs, meat and fish becoming 5.50 per cent costlier.Cereals became dearer by 4.78 per cent, with prices of rice going up by 2.51 per cent.Overall, primary articles prices registered 10.87 per cent inflation during the week under review, compared to 11.60 per cent in the previous week. Meanwhile, non-food primary articles inflation went down to 21.31 per cent for the week ended May 21 from 23.22 per cent in the previous week.Fibres became dearer by 55.82 per cent and minerals by 11.78 per cent.The recent hike in retail prices of petrol was also reflected in the data. Petrol was up 32.41 per cent year-on-year. Inflation in petrol had stood consistent at 21.81 per cent during the previous few weeks.The government and Reserve Bank had said that in the months to come, inflationary pressure would be more from core (non-food) items on account of high global prices of commodities, particularly crude.A rise in prices of food items was the main reason for inflationary pressure during 2010. Food inflation was in double digits for most of last year, before showing signs of moderation from March this year.Food inflation fell to an 18-month low of 7.47 per cent in the first week of May, before rising again in the second week.Headline inflation stood at 8.66 per cent in April. The RBI, in its monetary policy for 2011-12, had projected that overall inflation would average 9 per cent during the first half of this fiscal.The latest drop in food inflation numbers comes in the wake of a slew of bad news for the economy. GDP growth of the country slowed to a five-quarter low of 7.8 per cent during the January-March quarter, while the six core industries registered meagre 5.2 per cent expansion in April.Experts had blamed inflation and the resultant rate hikes by the RBI, which resulted in slowing down of investment, for the poor economic growth numbers."

However, the price volatility in non-food items continues to be a cause for concern as the inflation in this primary article segment, though declining, still remains above 20 per cent.Even as food inflation, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), at slightly over 8 per cent during the week was way lower when compared to 21.15 per cent during the third week of May, 2010, the inflation in non-food primary articles eased only marginally to 21.31 per cent, ostensibly owing to the Rs.5 a litre hike in the retail prices of petrol following which the motor fuel was up 32.41 per cent on a year-on-year basis.Despite the uncertainty over oil prices in the global market, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee expressed cautious optimism over a likely moderation in inflation in the coming weeks. Noting that though uncertainty still prevailed on the fuel price front, he said a decline in overall primary articles' inflation was also evident.... If the declining trend in food items and non-food primary articles continues, then perhaps it will be possible to have a moderate rate of inflation  The important figure is the non-food WPI. There is practically a two percentage point decrease from 23.22 per cent to 21.31 per cent [in that segment]. My comment is that there will be a moderation in inflation, Mr. Mukherjee said.Mr. Mukherjee also felt that analysts should look at the broader picture and not the week-to-week or month-to-month inflation figures even though the fact remains that the retail prices of diesel and LPG are expected to be raised some time during this month which, in turn, would get reflected in the WPI inflation data with a fortnight's time lag.Commenting on the WPI data, financial services firm Kassa Director Siddharth Shankar said: The numbers have shown some improvement, but it is too early to say that inflation will fall in the coming months. We still have to see the impact of fuel price hike.During the week, prices of pulses eased by 9.22 per cent year-on-year, while wheat turned cheaper by 0.77 per cent. Alongside, vegetable prices were lower by 1.06 per cent on a yearly basis, while potatoes became cheaper by 2.15 per cent. However, milk turned dearer by 7.04 per cent while eggs, meat and fish were also 5.50 per cent costlier. Other food items also turned more expensive with prices of fruits up 30.51 per cent and onions by 12.32 per cent on an annual basis.Pranab Mukherjee expresses cautious optimism over likely moderation in inflation in coming weeks"

However, he said that a few distributors trying to rake in extra profits are trying to create artificial scarcity.In order to counter this, two task forces will be created in each taluk of the district to ensure that problems of the farmers are resolved.Addressing mediapersons here recently, he said that the district needs about 1.2 lakh metric tonnes of pesticide every year. This year, an additional 10,000 metric tonnes have been kept in stock, he added.Mentioning that there is no shortage of seeds this year, he said that the government has clearly stated that it would supply more pesticides and seeds, if the district demands.Pointing out that a few distributors were trying to create artificial scarcity to reap more profits, he said that action will be taken to hoarding.Deputy Commissioner Jagadish said that a meeting will be convened on Monday comprising farmers associations, pesticide distributors and agricultural officers. The meeting will aim to resolve the issues faced by ryots and also a task force will be constituted.Help LineHe said that district administration will be starting a Help Line, through which farmers can discuss their problems by calling a dedicated telephone number.He said that the members of the task force will try and resolve the problems of the farmers.Indicating that a meeting would be held on every Wednesday afternoon at the Deputy Commissioners Office, he said that complaints filed by farmers will be looked into and necessary action will be initiated.Inclusion of scientistsObserving that farmers growing potato have been facing losses during the past few years, he said that a team comprising of scientists and agricultural experts will be formed to give the ryots a helping hand. Experts from agricultural colleges, scientists from Agricultural Science Centre will be part of the team, he added.Jagadish said that the government has decided to provide 50 per cent subsidy to fertilizers. If the bill is produced by the ryots, then 50 per cent of the cost would be refunded, he added.Certified potato seedsExclaiming that farmers hadnt used certified potato seeds during the previous year, Deputy Commissioner Jagadish said that a proposal has been sent to the government seeking permission to distribute certified seeds provided by the National Seed Corporation, during the next year.Even though certified seeds tend to be a bit costlier, it wouldnt cause loss to farmers, he added. Also if subsidy is given, then farmers will definitely buy the seeds, he said.He said that until now certified seeds were being distributed through the department and had caused the private players to sell their seeds at a lower price. But, if the certified seeds are sold through private distributors, then the crop losses can be contained, he added.A discussion will be held with private distributors within a month or two, he mentioned."

One kg of potato will be between Rs. 14 and Rs. 16.The price in April ranged between Rs. 450 and Rs. 550 for a 45 kg bag in Mettupalayam.Potato from the Nilgiris is traded in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Tiruchi, Salem and Vellore, and also to other States.They fetch higher price always when compared to those grown in Karnataka and Northern States because of the better quality and longer shelf-life.Potato is priced based on quality, size, colour and shelf-life. It is also graded based on different quality parameters.In Tamil Nadu, potato is grown in the hilly regions of Dindigul, the Nilgiris, Krishnagiri and Erode districts.It is cultivated in 4,600 hectares in the State and the production this year is 97,200 tonnes as against the 80,600 tonnes last year.During the lean season, traders outsource potato from Agra, Hasanpur, Indore and Kolar to cater to the needs of the consumers of Tamil Nadu."

However, nosenior banker is willing to comment on the issue as they feel it is a political hot potato to talk about the impact of such a ban.According to data from RBI, of the Rs 7,88,299 crore currency in circulation, 76% is in the form of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. However, when it comes to numbers, these two denominations represent 17% of currency notes. Despite the presence of high denominations, RBI had spent Rs 2,754 crore in printing notes. Bankers say that if the notes of these two denominations are withdrawn, the cost of handling cash would zoom and there would be chaos.Operators of automated teller machines say that banning Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes will throw up huge challenges as ATM machines will hold less than a fifth of their current capacity. ""An ATM machine typically holds 10,000 bills if these were to comprise only notes of Rs 100 the rate of replenishment would go up. This will increase costs and inconvenience customers,"" said Mani Mamallan, chief marketing office, C-Edge Technologies, a joint venture between SBI andBesides, transaction time at machines would also rise because maximum amount that can be withdrawn at a stretch would be Rs 5,000 since machines are designed to dispense only 50 notes at a time. The cost of printing notes for RBI would also multiply. ""A high transaction ATM which runs out of cash once a day will fall short of currency several times. This is so because cash replenishment agencies will take a couple of hours to respond, customers will be affected because of the downtime ,"" said Sunil Udupa, CEO, AGS Infotech , another company that supplies machines and maintains bank ATM networks . According to Udupa, the only solution for a bank would be to raise the number of machines in a location. ""Taking such measures will hike their cost, but that is the only way that they can ensure that cash is consistently available to customers if high value notes are withdrawn,"" said Udupa. Besides the costs, banks feel black money will be shifted to gold or dollars.""Electronic payments account for only 5% of all transactions . One reason for this is the absence of financial inclusion as a result of which daily wage earners receive payment in cash,"" said a banker. ""It's only when everyone has a bank account and a payment card that electronic transactions will gain popularity"" ."

Price of peas has more than doubled to touch Rs 150 a kg, while cabbages are available for Rs 5 a kg in the retail market.Price of beans has also doubled, while that of drumstick, carrots and potatoes has reduced. Most vegetables sold in the city are transported by trucks from neighbouring states.Dealers and vendors blame the price change on the heavy downpour in Karnataka and Maharashtra. S Chandran, a wholesale dealer in beans at the Koyambedu market, said showers meant bad news for beans growers. ""Rains adversely affect beans crop, causing fungal diseases and increase of pests in the soil,"" he said.On the other hand, vegetables such as drumstick and carrots have benefited. ""Rains have ensured high yields resulting in a good harvest of drumsticks, carrots and potatoes, leading to a dip in prices,"" said V R Soundarajan, market advisor to the wholesaler's association in Koyambedu. ""Peas are short in supply since they are usually in great demand during this wedding season,"" he added.The rains also affect the transportation of goods and the perishable commodities arrive late at the market.Retail outlets such as Reliance Fresh, More and Nilgiris said the prices have not affected sales. ""Increase and decrease of prices are common during this season. That would not affect our sales in any manner,"" said R Yuvraj, manager of More supermarket on TTK Road. Small vendors, however, are concerned. Selvaraj James, a vendor on TTK Road said his regular customers did not buy peas or beans this week.Equally unhappy are some homemakers like Shanthi Daniel. ""All vegetables seem overpriced these days. The government should do something about these fluctuating prices,"" she said."

In its annual monetary policy for 2011-12 announced last month, the Reserve Bank had said that inflationary pressure will continue for the next few months on account of high international commodity prices, particularly of crude.It had said that headline inflation would be driven more by commodities like oil in the near future, rather than high food prices, as was the case during most of 2010. The RBI had projected headline inflation to average 9 per cent during the first half of the fiscal, before moderating to around 6 per cent by March, 2012.Food inflation was in double digits for most of last year, before showing signs of moderation since March this year. However, it had again breached the 9 per cent mark during the last week of May after a gap of two months.The government had to deal with a series of bad news during recent weeks on the economic front. While January-March economic growth stood at 7.8 per cent, the lowest in five quarters, industrial output also slowed down to 6.3 per cent in April."

Get ready for a five-star spend. The prices of some essential vegetables have almost doubled since the beginning of this month.Vendors aren't sure why prices have spiralled. They blame poor supply and rising demand. Besides, it's also the wedding season. Spring onion, lady's finger and beans top the unaffordability chart.""As monsoon sets in, vegetable prices usually go up. Part of it is a cyclical process. The other reason is inflationary pressure on food commodities, including vegetables. Hopcoms, a government intervention mechanism, should be proactive in marketing essential vegetables. This can bring prices down,"" RS Deshpande, director, Institute of Social and Economic Change, says.Salamath H, a Johnson Market vendor, says prices were stable in April-May, but beginning June, most started to rise. Beans went up from Rs 35 to Rs 60 per kg this month. Ditto with green peas and double beans, which doubled from Rs 40 to Rs 80 per kg.At Hopcoms, it's no better. ""This is the wedding season, so orders are big; but we don't have enough supply. The quality of potatoes is bad because of storage problems. I hope prices will start falling in a couple of months. People are buying as they have no other option,"" he says.""Can we live without vegetables? It's time the government intervenes and moderates prices,"" says Priya Singh, a customer at Johnson Market."

Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Patna, June 29: The state government should introduce a special package for a chain of cold storages to promote the food-processing industries, said former vice-president of Bihar Industries Association (BIA) S.N. Ashraf today. Ashraf, at a workshop on Role of cold storage in the development of food-processing industries  opportunities and challenges organised by BIA on its premises, added that it had become non-viable to run cold storages in the state, given the high cost of power which is not available according to requirement. He said: To give agriculture a boost, the government should encourage food-processing industries. This would be possible only when there is a cold chain infrastructure based on the latest technology that consumes less energy. At present, the cold storage industry is going through hard times despite the state governments sincere efforts to promote and set up such storages. The need of the hour is that the government should come out with a special package for the cold storage business, Ashraf said. The state government should either introduce a special subsidised electricity tariff for cold storages or should give concessions or rebates on the electricity consumed by the cold storages, Ashraf said adding that the rebate on energy consumption that cold storages got till 1980 should be revived. Besides this, the government should provide uninterrupted power supply to the cold storages through a dedicated feeder in those areas where 10 to 15 storages have been set up, like Biharsharif, Samastipur and Danapur, the former BIA vice-president said. He also stressed on the need to diversify the use of cold storages. They should not be confined to potatoes but also store other food and dairy products. The government, in its recently announced industrial policy, has incorporated the food-processing industries as a thrust area, Ashraf said."

No wonder the first priority of students is to get admission in colleges here. Established in 1922, with just three colleges  St. Stephens, Hindu College and Ramjas College  at that time, today the campus boasts of some of the most popular colleges not just in the city but the country as well.For students, North campus is a foodies paradise. There are some must haves in this area, such as the bhelpuri bhaiya right next to the Patel Chest bus stop, serving a plate of chatpata bhelpuri at Rs 20. Another hot favourite among students is the Momo point in Kamla Nagar market, offering chicken and pork momos, chilly chicken and chowmein at cheap rates. Chache chole bhature wala, selling plain as well as potato stuffed bhature, is perhaps the one shop that has made Kamla Nagar Market so popular. Mutton cutlets and mutton dosa at The Delhi School of Economics Cafeteria are great too.Dont call it Kamla Nagar, its K nags, yes thats what students love calling their one and only market in North Campus. Its famous for its small roadside shops selling junk jewellery and shops selling made in Bangkok clothes. Other places are various coffee chain shops where students love to take a break.Paying guest accommodation in not too expensive, and ranges between Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000. A PG here would serve you aloo parantha for breakfast, rice and dal for lunch and in dinner you can fill your stomach with roti, vegetables and boondi raita. The deadlines is 10 pm.Fest time is the most awaited time of the year. Some of the famous fests here, are Crossroads of Sri Ram College of Commerce, known for its rock show, where singers like Palash Sen, Kailash Kher and KK have performed in the recent past.

The fest season is incomplete without Miranda Houses Tempest, where guys from North Campus can do anything to get an entry. You know why!Nearest Metro station Vishwa Vidyalaya Metro StationVerdict North Campus is where you should be, if you want to experience real Delhi University life.As a result of DUs multi-campus system plan, south campus was established in the year 1973. But the disadvantage is that all the colleges are scattered over the whole of South Delhi such as Lady Shri Ram College in Moolchand, Sri Venkateswara College in Dhaula Kuan, Kamla Nehru College in Khel Gaon Marg and Jesus and Mary College in Chanakyapuri amongst many others scattered elsewhere.If north has Momo point than how can south lag behind. The momo joints outside Yashwant, also popularly known as Chanakya cinema complex, Brown Sugar, Dilli Haat are worth trying. The bhel puri wala outside Lady Shri Ram College is known for his delicious and hygienic bhel puri. He even has a facebook and orkut community dedicated to him by the students of this college.South Campus has better shopping options. Students here, have access to everything from fancy to streetwear, thanks to the proximity to markets such as Lajpat Nagar, GK 1 M block and South Extension amongst others. If Sarojni Nagar market is famous for export clothes at cheap rates, GK 1 M block serves the best of brands with a good variety. Dont miss out on the basement shops, popular with jeans lovers in both the campuses as you get good fits at reasonable rates. Other places to hang out are Select City Walk mall, Ansal Plaza and Acharya Niketan market.The PG rates in South have really shot up in the past couple of years. A normal PG with three times meal would cost you between Rs 7000 to Rs 11,000. You can expect macroni and garlic bread for breakfast and pasta for dinner. With the start of the South Delhi metro, almost all the colleges are well connected through metro.Lady Shri Ram Colleges Tarang, Kamla Nehru Colleges Ullas and Sri Venkateswara Colleges Nexus are the most happening fests of South campus. While at Tarang, you have the famous food festival offering a combination of street food and other eateries of Delhi, Ullas has great dance performances and well attended rock nights every year.Nearest Metro station since the colleges in South Campus are located far away from each other, there are different metro stations as well.Verdict come to South Campus if you want to be with the coolest crowd."

They staged a demonstration at the Dr. B.R. Ambedkar garden here on Monday.The farmers from Agasga, Kednur, Devgiri and Honaga participated in the agitation. They held placards that said: I am for sale. They shouted slogans against the insensitive district administration and State Government for not extending total waiver of loans under State and Central schemes meant for small farmers.The farmers led by the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene submitted at least 200 to 300 memorandums to the Government since 1994-95 pleading for proper compensation for loss of crops like sugarcane, potato and other produce due to heavy rainfall, besides losses due to adverse market conditions. Subsequently, the farmers of the region suffered huge loss due to poor prices of vegetables in the market in 2001-02. With that the farmers could not repay their loans which mounted up along with interest component.The farmers lost entire crops in rains for three to four years from 2005-06. While the Centre and State Government waived off loans and interest of many farmers, those of this region have been deprived of the benefit as they had availed themselves of loans from private financiers. Addressing farmers, Sangh's Belgaum taluk president Appa Saheb Desai said Governments have been hiking allowances of elected representatives so that they can lead more luxurious lives without realising that they are doing so at the tax-payers' expense. The same Government has failed to increase the compensation among for crop loss, which is Rs. 400 per acre from ages. Mr. Appa Saheb Desai reiterated that Rs. 400-crore outstanding loan of farmers of the region should be waived."

Most veggie prices hit the roof in city",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/Ouch-its-hot-Most-veggie-prices-hit-the-roof-in-city/articleshow/9143999.cms,2011-07-08,The Times Of India,"JAIPUR: As vegetable prices sky rocketed in the city, the common man is feeling the pinch in the pocket. Vegetable vendors are now selling most of their items at Rs 40 or Rs 50 per kg. Traders and agriculture experts claimed that price hikes in July are mainly because the vegetables are out of season and an impact of the diesel price rise, which has shot up the transport cost.""The main reason for the price rise is that most of the vegetables are not grown in this season as farmers plan for kharif crops,"" Kanhaiya Lal, a vegetable vendor here said. Among the items whose prices have increased considerably include tomato. The price of a kilogram of tomatoes is double of what it was last month. At the vegetable wholesale market in Muhana, tomatoes were sold at Rs 500 per quintal on June 7, but on July 7, it shot up to Rs 1,000 per quintal. As a result, retailers, who have been selling them in the range of Rs 10 and Rs 12 per kg last month, are now selling the commodity between Rs 20 and Rs22 per kg. Similarly, ladiesfinger have also been sold at a much higher price on Thursday.The stock of ladiesfinger in Muhana market was very less due to its less cultivation. In the first week of June, around 200 quintals of ladiesfingers arrived at the wholesale market but it was reduced to just 90 quintal now. On June 7, a kilogram of ladiesfingers was sold in the range of Rs 20 and Rs25 but it is now being sold in the range of Rs 40 and Rs 42. Also, the wholesale price of ladiesfinger was Rs 500 per quintal on June 6 but now it has come up to Rs 900 per quintal. Hans Raj Khurana, a retailer, said, ""Prices of leafy vegetables like spinach have increased as they rot very fast due to the increase in air moisture."" The prices of spinach have increased from Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg to Rs 20 to Rs 25 per kg.Also, cabbage, which is imported from other states, is being sold around Rs 40 to Rs50 per kg. But, the prices of cauliflower and bottle gourd are in the range of Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg in the market. There is no significant change in the prices of potato and onion. Other items like beans and capsicum have touched the Rs 40 per kg mark. Their prices were as low as Rs 24 and Rs 30 respectively last month. There is also a steep rise in the prices of coriander leaves. On Wednesday, the prices of coriander leaves were around Rs 50 to Rs 52 per kilo but on Thursday it is sold at Rs 60 at all retail vegetable shops. Also, the wholesale price of cucumber which was Rs 400 per quintal on June 6 has increased to Rs 800 per quintal on July 7."

That has its impact.Mr. Mukherjee went on to add that there could be some upward movement in headline inflation in June from 9.06 per cent in May and this would be mainly owing to the fuel price hike announced last month.Evidently, the apprehension is that while food prices would tend to soften in the event of a good monsoon, the hike in fuel prices could affect the overall trend. In fact, the food segment may again get impacted by way of higher transportation costs for grains and other crops.During the week, pulses turned cheaper by over 9 per cent year-on-year, while prices of vegetables and potatoes eased by 8.74 per cent and 2.13 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, other edibles continued to remain expensive such as fruits by 22.75 per cent and onions by 21.24 per cent. Alongside, protein-rich items like eggs meat and fish were up 10.12 per cent and milk by 12.10 per cent on an annual basis."

Congress leaders, including UPCC president Rita Bahuguna Joshi, described Mr. Gandhi as a farmers' leader.'The impromptu non-political forum' was formed on the Exhibition Ground to enable the farmers and their representatives to present their problems before Mr. Gandhi at the mahapanchayat.'About 40 farmers and their representatives from across the State were shortlisted to speak before Mr. Gandhi's address. While some of the speakers appeared to have been tutored on what to say, others were being prompted from the rear. Only 14 speakers presented their woes as the mahapanchayat' was already two hours behind schedule, following heavy rainfall in Aligarh and surrounding areas and Mr. Gandhi's delayed arrival from Delhi due to inclement weather.Mahendra Singh of the Tappal Andolan Samiti assailed the State government for misleading farmers on the compensation rates for the land acquired for the Yamuna Expressway project and the township.Mahabir Singh of Bhatta-Parsaul said Noida was the home district of Ms. Mayawati and the farmers elected her in 2007 in the hope of getting their due rights, but have been taken for a ride by her government.Referring to the violence in Bhatta-Parsaul, Mr. Singh sought the ouster of the present regime and a vote for the Congress in 2012. Jaiveer Singh also from Bhatta lauded Mr. Gandhi for saving Bhatta-Parsaul, hailed him as a kisanon ka neta (farmers' leader) and asked people not to forget to vote for the Congress in the 2012 polls.Dharamveer Singh, a farmer from Hathras district (Ramabai Nagar), demanded better warehousing facilities for potato farmers. He urged Mr. Gandhi to ensure that compensation for the land acquired by the Railways for the Delhi-Kolkata rail line project was given to the farmers soon."
168,Bountiful Brunch,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/bountiful-brunch/,2011-07-10,Indian Express,"With multi-cuisine menus and extended hours,brunches in the city have become a top draw on lazy Sunday afternoonsThe last day of the week is definitely reserved for taking it easy and lounging around at home can be fun on Sundays. But if you are in no mood to labour in the kitchen,try heading out for a brunch with family and friends. Surprisingly,restaurants in the city,which have been rather late in introducing the concept,are now pulling all stops to make brunches busy,and well,buzzy events. Taking the lead is Hometel Chandigarh,which has rolled out a Sunday brunch. This one is complete with live cooking stations that offer multiple cuisines. While the food is a mix of Indian,Continental and Mediterranean,we particularly liked the cheerful ambience of the place. It even has play areas offering colouring activities for children. To keep the adults engrossed,the chefs conduct cake decoration classes as well.A Sunday brunch is a new concept in Chandigarh and weve deliberately gone all out to make the concept popular, says Ashish Bali,the restaurants executive chef. Beginning 11 am onwards,every Sunday,the brunch menu tosses up new surprises,including the quintessential Punjabi family meals like choley bhature and tikki-chaat. These find place alongside dishes like steak with barbeque sauce and chicken satay. We found the main course menu very plump and the black bean sweet potato chilli soup was a pleasant surprise. The Sunday brunch at Hometel Chandigarh,is priced at Rs 475 (excluding taxes) and if you are looking for some free spirits (two pints of beer) to guzzle along with your meal,it costs Rs 775 (excluding taxes).If that is not fancy enough,then head to Zazen,the Oriental fine-diner in Panchkula. Here,the brunch priced at an all inclusive Rs 999,offers a four course meal and a choice of unlimited drinks from the bar (house brands only). But if you are in a mood to detox,opt for the all inclusive package for Rs 699 that lets you start with an Oriental soup. We settled for the former and opted for a Caprioska,which is in the line-up of choices. The brunch at Zazen is timed between 12 noon to 4 pm and the service is very efficient. The starters,which are a good mix of vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian dishes,arrived just as we settled down. The Amritsari fish was delectable. Dittto for the Hosin glazed chicken wings. But for those who prefer the Oriental specials at Zazen,the vegetable spring rolls bursting with cheddar cheese and corn kernels will tempt you for a second serving. To add variety to the brunch,Swatantra Gautam,the executive chef has introduced a meal in a bowl option,which is the second course. Standing behind the live station as he willingly tossed our choice of ingredients into the wok,Gautam remarked,We wanted to personalise the eating out experience and therefore dishing a meal in a bowl is based on the diners tastes. There are a lot of vegetarians in this town, says Gautam. Theres also a live pasta counter for those looking to twirl spaghetti instead of pad Thai noodles in their forks. Even though the two courses more than filled us up,there was the main course buffet that boasted predominantly of Pan-Asian fare. To keep the children happy,Zazen offers mini meals packing in potato smileys,mini burgers and the like. The big fat brunch ends here with a platter-full of desserts and fruits.The Sunday brunch trail would be incomplete without mentioning Kavas lineup. The brunch (Rs 900) begins with a spread of salads,cold cuts,cheese platters,mini-sandwiches,eggs of your choice,cornflakes and cold coffee. Themed around The Emperors Meal,the spread brings in starters,followed by a main course buffet,which includes two cuisines,cocktails and beer. While we were a tad satiated after nibbling on the starters,the salads were impressive. In the main course,we liked the Thai red curry and the wok-tossed super-thin noodles. The dessert spread,meanwhile,dished out regulars like mousse,chocolate,custard,tart and cakes. It is advisable to head for the meal post-noon,rather than 11 am (when the brunch starts),to make the most of the lavish spread. A prior reservation is recommended.Contacts: Hometel Chandigarh- 4299 999; Zazen- 4266666; Kava- 0172-5043666For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

It would stay like this till the end of the monsoon season."" He attributed this to three factors. ""Crop season of many vegetables end with the arrival of monsoon.

171,Midday menu’s hot potato ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110713/jsp/jharkhand/story_14233310.jsp,2011-07-13,Telegraph,"Ranchi, July 12: Manjit Bedia, a fifth grader of Government Middle School at Karmatoli Chowk, could not believe his eyes when he was served midday meal this afternoon. Aaj mujhe kaddu khane ko mila ek mahina baad (Today I got to eat gourd after a month), he beamed. Normally, the menu isnt as interesting with just rice, dal and mashed potatoes five days a week, echoed fourth grader Sangeeta Kujur. These days, we are served only potatoes and no green vegetables. Many of us do not like to eat it and it goes waste, the girl said, savouring her modest quota of kaddu-alu sabzi. The Karmatoli cradle, which has 350-odd students on its rolls, is not the only one skimping on nutrition, more than 400 state-run middle and high schools in both urban and rural pockets of Ranchi are not being able to serve up green midday platters, courtesy rise in vegetable prices. According to experts at Birsa Agriculture University, an overindulgent rain god is to blame for soaring vegetable prices. Heavy rain has damaged vegetables in bulk, leading to price hike. It will take at least three months for the rates to become reasonable, said B.N. Singh, director (research). Earlier, every child was given 50gm of protein in the form of green vegetables; but now, the quantity has been reduced to half while occasional soybean has replaced vegetables. Even two months ago, midday meal was arguably lavish with lentil, rice and green vegetables on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, vegetable biryani on Wednesdays and kichdi, mashed potatoes and pickles on Saturdays. Students were also given eggs, apples, bananas and kheer. However, last month, the state education department shrunk the fare to just rice, dal and green vegetables for five days a week. And with food prices soaring, only humble potatoes accompany rice and dal, besides the very irregular soybean supplement. S. Prasad, the principal of Government Middle School, Karamtoli, conceded that they were unable to purchase green vegetables. We are supposed to provide 100gm of rice, 20gm of lentils and 50gm of green vegetables to every student. But we are serving soybean instead, he said. Prasad added that egg too was way beyond their reach. It comes at Rs 40 a dozen. So, we are serving soybean instead. Kishore Kumar Verma, the principal of Government Middle School, Lohardaga, said they had had to replace green vegetables with jackfruit. It is cheaper (Rs 12 a kg) compared to vegetables, the prices of which start from Rs 24 a kg. We have 800 children and it is not possible for us to stick to the erstwhile menu every day, Verma maintained. Notably, the state government revised the rates of midday meal per child from Rs 3.02 to Rs 3.17, effective from June 1, but schools are crying hoarse that the subsidy isnt enough."

As a precautionary measure, heavy armed police presence continued in Kodala and its adjoining areas.Members of the Eragola community whose houses at Kodala were torched by a mob of villagers on Wednesday have been sheltered in the Kodala Kalyan Mandap.

For, the prime reason for the decline is the statistical effect of a high base as food inflation during the like period last year was at a high of 18.56 per cent.In the event, it is understandable that despite the marked moderation, it rendered no great comfort to Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee owing to persisting inflationary pressures and the absence of a firm downward trend.  there is still inflationary pressure [in the economy]  These weekly figures fluctuate mainly on the base [effect].

For more than 200 students who stay here the mess provides four meals  breakfast at 7 am,lunch from 10 am ,afternoon snack at 4 pm and dinner from 6 pm. Dilipbhai,the in-charge of the mess since 20 years now,has melted into the fabric of the eatery.On the menu on a Thursday morning is dal,rice,kidney beans and freshly made capsicum. The hot fulkas keep coming and students and guests around keep savouring it. Thursday,in fact is also the day for a change in the menu. We make all sorts of delicacies for dinner on Thursday, says Dilipbhai J Malani. The menu is set for the entire week beforehand by the students. Explaining the process,Dilipbhai says, A students committee is formed consisting of 10-15 boys and they decide the menu. On can see the weeks breakfast menu written on a plastic coated hardboard paper stuck on the wall. The food,made by a Rajasthani staff,instantly reminds one of home. The vegetables are mildly spicy and are always accompanied by either freshly cut salad or chutney. Not to forget,crispy papad for dinner. The food maintains its classic marwari flavour and is easily one of the best places to have a good Jain thali.Twenty-three- year-old MBA student Rahul Mishra,who stays quite close to the mess,is a regular visitor.  What I love the most about this place is the quality of the food. Elsewhere,even the basic food tastes bad,here the food is quite simple,but you know its made well and is tasty. The menu is quite diverse- right from veggies like gourd,bottle gourd,round gourd,spinach to potatoes and pulses everything is made. A different preparation is made for those who prefer having Jain food. Mostly catering to the students who reside in the hostel,the mess also gets occasional visitors from outside. While the students pay their entire mess fee right at the beginning of the year,the mess allows outsiders to come and eat at the cost of R 50 per meal and R 10-12 for breakfast. A cup of tea,coffee or milk costs R 6.

182,"Television, an easy escape from reality!",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/O-zone/television-an-easy-escape-from-reality/,2011-07-31,The Times Of India,"Passive television viewing has affected the culture of an entire generation, reducing families to individuals living together under one roof!What did we do with our evenings when there was no cable television? Difficult to imagine, but prior to the advent of TV, evenings were family bonding time when you got to hear about each others day, go for an evening walk, sit out late evening in the garden with a jug of lemonade, or just roll around the grass with your puppy trying to lick your face! You would drop in on neighbours or receive visitors at your home.Those were long, never-ending evenings when you talked, laughed, fought, made up or even just stood around on the terrace counting the stars and trying to spot one you could identify for the kids. You had time for a game of tennis or badminton, or even some carom board or card games with the family.But today, once home, most people make a beeline for the remote that transports each individual into a world of his own, depending on TV to engage our minds and our fickle attention span. Most homes have more than two television sets to accommodate varied interests! TV is not just our evening entertainment, but our entire evening engagement. This one activity has changed the culture of an entire generation, and today the TV schedule dictates the familys activities!TV in fact is one of the easiest addictions to slip into without even realizing what we are letting ourselves in for. And it can be a harmful affliction. Watching television is an easy escape from life; it is an effective way of forgetting your troubles rather than dealing with them head-on! Also, television encourages us to rest our minds and senses and let the sound and images just wash over us  neither a creative nor intelligent activity at all! TV addicts arent called couch potatoes for nothing! Weight gain and aggression are obvious by-products of passive TV watching over long hours. Other activities such as socializing, reading, conversing or exercising are far more productive, aiding the development of mind and body.A mother of two complains of how frustrated she feels with the lack of communication at home. When she is done watching her serials, she finds her husband glued to the News while the children are laughing out loud in their room along with pre-recorded cues in English sitcoms!An author friend, much celebrated for her first book, was struggling to finish her second. In a bid to bring some discipline to her writing schedule, one of the first things she did was ban television from her life! This is the most insidious and intrusive of media, she complained. You tend to leave the contraption on, especially if you live alone, and before you know it, you are hooked for hours. And there goes your noble plan of devoting time to work!At this rate we are fast catching up with the Americans, 49 percent of whom admit they watch too much television! The average American today, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co, watches more than four hours of TV each day (or 28 hours/week, or 2 months of nonstop TV-watching per year). In a 65-year life, that person will have spent 9 years glued to the tube! The TAM report for the last four weeks states that the urban Indian male watches television for an average 3.2 hours daily, while women watch it for an average of 3.6 hours every day.As per IRS Q1 (all-India data), 41 percent Indians do not watch TV as yet. Of the rest 59 pc that do watch, 15 percent watch TV for an average one hour a day on weekdays; 22 percent watch it for 1-2 hours daily on weekdays, while the remaining 12 percent watch it for 2-3 hours daily on weekdays. According to Nielson cross-platform Q1 report, TV viewership increased by 22 minutes per month per person over the last one year.An overdose of television may work very well for the elderly. Think about your grandma and grandpa. Not many years ago their days trudged by in weary monotony, totally dependent for their breaks and entertainment on visits by children and grandchildren and maybe a stroll in the nearby park where they met up with some old cronies. Now they have a date to keep with Gopi Bahu (Saathiya) at 7 pm, with Anandi (Balika Badhu) at 8 pm, Akshara and Naitik (Ye Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai) at 9.30 pm and then with Ram and Priya (Bade Achche Lagte Hain) at 10 pm. Not surprising then that globally adults (50-64) make up the largest segment (25 percent) of television-viewing audience.However those of us in our productive years  children and young professionals or even older people who want to do more than just wait out their old age  it is essential to refocus those staring, dazed eyes, discipline our habits and gain an upper hand over this insidious enemy within our bedrooms! It is indeed essential to define and limit TV viewing time for not just our children, but for ourselves too, so as to be able to get on with what we really want to get on with!How about imposing one No-TV Day each week at home?"

Each load has an average of 13 tonnes of vegetables.The market is yet to catch the Onam fever, said a trader at the Ernakulam market, but he did not foresee any possibility of an unprecedented rise in vegetable prices as the weather conditions in growing areas have been reported to be good.Initiatives by organisations like Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) and large-scale lease land farming by volunteers under the Kudumbashree mission; and more recently, the initiative by the State government under a 100-day intensive programme to produce more vegetables are expected to have a telling effect on vegetable availability this season.Scientists at VFPCK, who track the vegetable prices, have said that the price of most essential items have stabilised after prices peaked early this year under adverse weather conditions.Rampant pest attacks and unseasonal rains had hit vegetable production late 2010 and early 2011. VFPCK data showed that the price of major vegetable items have not shown any volatility over the last six months. Banana (nendran) was being sold at Rs.35 in the retail market here compared to the Rs.33 a kilogram in August 2010.Similarly, the price of tomato, Rs.10 a kg on Tuesday compared well with last month's price of Rs.14 a kg. Potatoes were being sold at the same price on Tuesday as in the previous month - Rs.20 a kg in the retail market.The price of shallots appears to be on an upward trajectory. It is the only vegetable item that has shown an upward trend over the last six months.Small onion was selling at Rs.40 a kg on Tuesday compared to Rs.24 a kg in the retail market last month.Prices of produces like cabbage, big onions, and tapioca were ruling quite steady. The price of carrot, however, had moved up to Rs.28 a kg in the retail market compared to the Rs.20 a kg last month."
185,Food inflation crosses 8% mark,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/181387/food-inflation-crosses-8-mark.html,2011-08-04,Deccan Herald,"Food inflation crosses 8% markLast updated: 04 August, 2011New Delhi, Aug 4, (PTI): 20:47 ISTMonsoon forecast a cause for concernDriven by increase in prices of onions, fruits and milk, food inflation for the week ended July 23 again soared to cross the 8 per cent mark after a brief period of moderation even as Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said efforts are on to bring it down to 5 per cent.The spurt in food inflation to 8.04 per cent from a 20- month low of 7.33 per cent for the week ended July 16 is mainly driven by rise in prices of onions, fruits and milk, the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) data released, on Thursday, stated. The rate of price rise of food items was 16.27 per cent in the corresponding week of July 2010.Replying to a debate on price rise in Parliament, Mukherjee said efforts were on to bring down the food inflation to a comfortable level of around 5 per cent.Food inflation should be around 5 per cent which will be comfortable, 6-7 per cent can be tolerated but surely not 8 per cent, he said.While international commodity prices and mismatch between supply and demand is pushing up inflation, experts said that below normal monsoon could further aggravate the situation.The data showed onions became dearer by 26.36 per cent year-on-year and fruits were expensive by 15.97 per cent during the week under review. Milk prices went up by 10.26 per cent, while vegetables were expensive by 10.20 per cent on an annual basis.Besides, cereal prices were up by 5.13 per cent, potatoes by 7.85 per cent, and egg, meat and fish by 6.66 per cent. The latest numbers also mark a resurgence of food inflation after a two-week long declining trend when the rate of price rise had fallen below the 8 per cent mark.Economists said that the Indian Meteorological Departments (IMD) latest monsoon forcast is a cause of concern and is likely to renew the price pressure. The IMD, on Wednesday, had forcast that rainfall for India as a whole during August-September is likely to be 90% of Long Period Average and could affect farm output in some parts.Overall, primary articles recorded inflation of 10.99 per cent for the week ended July 23, up from 10.49 per cent in the previous week. Primary articles have a share of over 20 per cent in the WPI. Inflation of non-food articles, which include fibres, oil seeds and minerals, however, fell to 15.60 per cent from 16.05 per cent in the previous week. Meanwhile, fuel and power inflation stood at 12.12 per cent.Headline inflation stood at 9.44 per cent in June, with the pressure coming mainly from manufactured items."
186,Food inflation inches up to 8.04%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/food-inflation-inches-up-to-804/article2323547.ece,2011-08-05,The Hindu,"Food inflation inched up yet again to 8.04 per cent for the week ended July 23 from a 20-month low of 7.33 per cent in the previous week mainly on account of an increase in the prices of onions, fruits and milk.Even as the government can draw some comfort from the fact that food inflation during the like week in July last year was way higher at 16.27 per cent, it is clear that current spurt in numbers is despite the wide difference as a consequence of a high base.Not surprising, therefore, that Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, in his reply to the discussion on price rise in the Lok Sabha, expressed dissatisfaction over the latest WPI (Wholesale Price Index) figures while noting that efforts were on to bring it down to 5 per cent. ... it [food inflation] should be around 5 per cent which will be comfortable ... six-to-seven per cent can be tolerated but surely not 8 per cent, he said.As per the WPI data, while onions turned dearer by 26.36 per cent on a year-on-year basis, fruits were also costlier by 15.97 per cent during the week. Prices of most other food items also ruled higher. Milk prices went up by 10.26 per cent while vegetables were costlier by 10.20 per cent on an annual basis. Alongside, prices of cereals were also up by 5.13 per cent, potatoes by 7.85 per cent while eggs, meat and fish were 6.66 per cent dearer.According to economic analysts, while much of the inflationary pressure is owing to high global commodity prices coupled with a domestic demand-supply mismatch, it is the uncertainty over monsoon rainfall that may fuel the price rise further.Clearly, the Indian Meteorological Department's (IMD) latest monsoon forecast is a cause of concern. Any slippage in the monsoon could affect food inflation numbers, especially in the case of vegetables, fruits and such other items, Crisil's Chief Economist D. K. Joshi said.The 7.33 per cent food inflation in the previous week was very low and some increase was expected, Deloitte, Haskin and Sells Director Anis Chakravarty said."
187,"US ratings, hot potatoes & India story",http://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/us-ratings-hot-potatoes-india-story/story-2ECIFYbsUc1VQToXBIA3nJ.html,2011-08-08,Hindustan Times,"Market sentiment is one thing, real problems quite another. So, when leaders of the world  the very rich G7, the upcoming G20 or any other nation  think about what to do when the world's most powerful economy loses its Triple-A rating (extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments), they need to grapple with three hot potatoes.India, in particular.The first is finance. When the US falls a notch to AA+ (very strong capacity to meet financial commitments, with the '+' indicating a relatively better score than other AA), it will ideally have to pay a higher interest rate on its sovereign paper.As a result, other countries too will have to pay a higher return on their sovereign debt as well. This has an impact on corporate borrowing, and companies too will have to bear a higher cost when selling bonds. The US downgrade is not going to hurt India very much  the Reserve Bank of India has already raised policy rates to levels that are far higher its global rating. And the reason is domestic: inflation.Which brings us to the second hot potato  economics. While most of the developed world is fighting a contraction or recession and a strange phenomenon where close-to-zero interest rates are not enough for companies to borrow, the case in India is the reverse.Excessive economic growth  the second-highest after China  has unleashed a dynamism and cash in the system without the accompanying increase in supply of goods and services. The result: a high inflation rate.This is a very nice ""problem"" to have. Because of high economic growth, a country attracts capital from across the world. This capital, when invested in businesses or even real estate, creates jobs and ensures the accompanying prosperity through secondary and tertiary employment. But sudden growth spurts need equally strong and immediate solutions for managing shortages in food, transport, goods and services. This is particularly important for countries like India that is running on domestic consumption boom  driven by the growth  and not merely exports like China.But to do that, we come to the third hot potato  politics. While the Obama administration is under pressure of being ""less stable, less effective and less predictable than what we previously believed"", according to S&P, and as a result is now in the same bracket as China and Japan (both AA-) and Spain, Kuwait and Slovenia (AA), bad politics is affecting India in a different way.India needs to take advantage of the uncertainty that has infected the globe since October 2008 and attract as much capital into the country as possible by opening up banking, retail, insurance, pensions, mining and so on. Instead, the government has been frozen into politicalsubmission by one scam after another, leading to a perception that we're going nowhere. This is clearly an exaggeration.Instead of wondering about the Sensex and pandering to markets, the Indian leadership needs to pull its political act together and get moving on reforms. The world is crumbling around us, and we will be hurt, of course. But if we focus on job creation, build real economies and serve real people, markets will come around."
188,Food prices could be 50% higher down the road,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Food-prices-could-be-50-higher-down-the-road/articleshow/9536355.cms,2011-08-09,The Times Of India,"MUMBAI: Of late , food prices have been displaying a whimsical trend across the city , and are being pegged to the preferences of a particular locality. Meat , for instance , is more expensive in Gujarati-dominated areas such as Kandivli and Borivli. On the contrary , foodgrains , vegetables as well as non-vegetarian items are relatively affordable in Nana Chowk Market , a pivotal bazaar of south Mumbai. Tur and moong dal are , in fact , cheaper here than in most suburbs at Rs 70 and Rs 82 a kg , respectively.Then again , Bandra's Pali Market sells vegetables at a premium than , say , its Bazar Road. Andheri municipal market offers cheaper produce than Lokhandwala Complex. Borivli's Shantivan offers better quality vegetables at cheaper rates than the anaemic yet exorbitant fare at upmarket Raheja Complex a kilometre away. In Mulund , prices drop by an unbelievable 50% just one street away.Moong dal , which sells at approximately Rs 100 per kg in Mumbai and Rs 110-120 in certain areas , is available for half the price in Vashi's retail market. Subhash Lakhotia , proprietor of Apna Bazar in Nerul , said , ""Retailers who pick up food items from the APMC wholesale market tend to adjust retail rates according to the transportation charges. So , prices are often higher in Mumbai than in Navi Mumbai.""Over the past few months , as inflation burns a hole in middle-class pockets , families have been seeking an escape route a little distance away. Working women as well as senior citizens have been opting to pick up vegetables and groceries at weekly bazars or municipal markets. They complain that vendors in upmarket areas not only cheat them by weight , but also behave rudely with bargainers given that upmarket clients pay whatever is quoted.Retired executive B V Bhandary , who lives in Yogi Nagar , Borivli West , makes a weekly shopping trip to the eastern side of the suburb. ""Most times , the vegetables we get in our locality are not even fresh and are yet overpriced. So , every Monday , we prefer to visit the wholesale market in Borivli East , which is close to the railway station. Vegetables there are fresh and are mostly priced up to 50% less. We don't even need to buy in bulk to avail of the lower rates.""A similar situation unfolds in Mulund West , at the junction of two parallel roads  RRT Road and J Nehru Road.All you have to do is decide which way to turn. R R T Road sells vegetables and fruits to the highrise residents of L B S Marg for a higher price with vendors claiming quality stuff. ""Since there are people who pay higher rates , why not sell for higher ?"" said one vendor with a shrug. ""Moreover , we consistently offer quality produce.""Yet, Nehru Road too has reasonably fresh produce  for 30-50 % less. One hawker was selling potatoes for as little as Rs 5 when his counterpart on the other side was calling out Rs 16. Siliguri resident S K Roy , who was visiting his daughter in Raheja Complex , Borivli , was shocked by the food prices in the locality. ""He took a rickshaw and asked the driver to take him to a big vegetable market ,"" said his daughter. ""He came back with bagfuls of fresh vegetables at lower prices from Shantivan , a place even I did not know existed."" Bandra businessman Zaki Khambati , who does not fancy lugging heavy shopping bags from another locality , has devised a way to buck the trend.Every weekend at Pali Market , he stands by and watches as the vendor takes down bulk orders over his phone. ""Not one buyer seems to be asking the prices. The vendor only notes the quantity of vegetables by kilos. Never once does he utter the price. Rich women and foreigners who live in the area stop by in cars and simply call out their orders , which are delivered to the vehicle. I wait for the elite and the expatriates to finish their shopping , then bargain over the price ,"" he said.(With inputs from Team TOI)"
189,"If CAG reports were believed, all Chief Ministers would have to be sacked…..",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-real-truth/if-cag-reports-were-believed-all-chief-ministers-would-have-to-be-sacked/,2011-08-09,The Times Of India,"The BJP has been demanding the resignation of the Delhi CM on the grounds that a recent CAG report on CWG has indicted her. I have for long been uncomfortable with CAG reports being used with such end-objectives. I have never considered CAG observations to be indictments at all. They are serious observations that need to be investigated further by other bodies. In the case of the Delhi CAG report, the BJP is also happy to violate all protocol and wants the report discussed in Parliament even before the PAC has seen it. The CAG itself has broken protocol by holding a press conference. This must be a new high for the CAG!But a closer analysis of the CAG reveals that if their reports were followed uniformly across all states, then there would hardly be any CM left to rule in the country. Of course, there would be no one left at the Centre either! Maybe the Supreme Court could run the country. They are probably the only ones on whom the CAG has no reports. Thankfully, the judiciary is constitutionally kept out of the purview of politics!Let me prove my point that there would be no CMs left. Since the BJP wants to use the CAG report as grounds for demanding Sheila Dixits resignation, let me only mention states ruled either by the BJP or its allies.Gujarat: The showpiece of the BJP. Narendra Modi is the tallest leader of the BJP nationally (just check out the CNN-IBN poll yesterday. It says that people would prefer Modi over Advani and Sushma Swaraj to be the next PM  of course, the top three choices for PM still remain with UPA  Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi). Well, the CAG has been very critical of the Gujarat government alleging mis-governance and worse in its recent report. As per its report, the GSPC (Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation) suffered a loss of Rs 106 crores by short recovery from Essar Oil Limited. Another agency GSEC passed undue benefits of Rs 37 crors to contractors because of improper fixation of monthly average coal per wagon. Then the massive loss caused by the Sujalam Sufalam scheme..allegedly amounting to Rs 500 crores. Narendra Modi hasnt resigned till date. Of course, as everyone knows, there is no Lok Ayukta in Gujarat  a state ruled by the BJP continuously for the last 12-13 years.Uttarakhand: There are similar indictments against the Uttarakhand government having caused a loss of Rs 44 crores in organizing the Kumbh Mela. But the BJP has ruled out the resignation of its CM, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank.Orissa: The Biju Janata Dal was an alliance partner of the NDA during its rule at the center as well as in the state until 2009 (wonder why allies break away from the BJP during elections!). As per the CAG reports on Orissa, most irrigation projects have been inordinately delayed in implementation, leading to cost overruns of Rs 3537 crores. This is as per the report submitted in July last year. Further, a minister in the Naveen Patnaik government is charged with having prevailed upon the management of a PSU, Orissa State Road Transport Corporation, to favor a lessee resulting in a loss of Rs 31 lacs. Small change, one would say! But has Naveen Patnaik resigned? Not to the best of my knowledge.Bihar: Another strong ally of the BJP, who preferred not to be seen alongside the BJP during the recent elections. As per the CAG report submitted in June last year, financial irregularities of Rs 11,412 crores were found in development schemes in Bihar (Nitish Kumar has been ruling since 2005). This was dubbed by the opposition as the treasury scam. Apparently, something called detailed contingency (DC) bills worth this amount had not been submitted for several years. A huge chunk of them are still to be submitted by the state government. Further, in the report submitted in July this year, the CAG report charges the Bihar government with a gamut of financial irregularities in the implementation of the government funded schemes adding up to Rs 1784 crores. Yet (fortunately for Bihars sake), Nitish Kumar continues as CM and is hailed as one of the best CMs in India. The CAG report was duly presented in the Assembly where it was discussed as per protocol.Madhya Pradesh: The CAG indicted the MP government stating that the return on investment made by the state government was as low as 0.6% last year (year ended March 2010) as against the rate of 7.3% that the government pays on its borrowings. So this is either a case of severe misgovernance or worse, corruption. Has Shivraj Singh Chouhan resigned? No!Chhatisgarh: Government was able to provide average employment of only 35 days per household under the NREGA scheme in 2007-8 as per the CAG report for that year. Yet, interestingly, in a display of nonpartisan leadership, the UPA government at the center awarded the Chhatisgarh government for excellence in implementation of this scheme. So the CAG indicated a fault.yet the government was acknowledged and awarded. Of course, the CAG also indicted the state governments police department for being totally inadequate in its response to the Naxal problem. Further, it was alleged by the CAG that an improper tendering process executed by the PSU Chhatisgarh Beej Evam Krishi Vikas Nigam Limited, resulted in an additional funding burden of Rs 94 lacs on purchase of ginger and potato seeds in 2005-6. Of course, Raman Singh has not resigned!I have taken examples of BJP ruled states only because it is the BJP that is demanding Sheila Dixits resignation in Delhi. There are similar CAG reports for all Congress ruled states as well. As is seen, the BJP in all its states has chosen to ignore the CAG reports. But when it comes to the CAG report on Delhi, it wants the scalp of Sheila Dixit.Of course, none of the media outlets in the country have deemed it necessary to bring out this part. This is plain double-speak by the BJP and yet the media is happy not to bring it out. Of course, its not as if the Congress can claim very high standards either. In each of the examples mentioned above states, the Congress has demanded the exact same as the BJP is demanding in Delhi  the resignation of the Chief Minister! So lets be candid here  its not as if one party is better than the other. Both are abusing CAG reports when convenient to them.There is so much politics in our country that every single institution is infected with it. The media is considered the fourth estate and has an extremely important role to play in a democracy. Ideally, the media should not take sides between two political parties. Yet, in India, media is totally aligned with one or the other. Take this small example. The leading newspaper in Mumbai has been raising a big storm recently about the condition of roads here. There are allegations of huge corruption in the allotment of road contracts. Contractors have been raising prices after winning the contracts. In one particular case, there has apparently been a cost escalation of 627%. Of course, the newspaper also gets its maths wrong. If an 11 crore rupee project finally becomes Rs 91 crores, then the escalation should be 727%, not 627%! But leave the maths aside. The newspaper has been reporting that the potholes are causing back problems to many people; many others are dying by falling off motor-cycles etc. The newspaper has raised the subject to the top of everyones mind. Finally, some action is likely to happen. What am I complaining about? All this is good right? It isnt. Because this paper has forgotten  or maybe it finds it inconvenient  to mention that the BMC which is responsible for the mess has been under the Shivsena-BJP coalition for nearly 20 years now. For a newspaper so acutely smart on political stories, how did it forgot to mention the name of Shivsena? Is this not a case of favoring one party over the other?Its time we cut the politics in this country. Lets focus on the economy instead. There are serious global problems which can cause grievous hurt to the Indian economy. If ever there was any reminder needed of this, there was a strong one provided yesterday. Stock markets around the world were pushed down by the weight of the US sovereign downgrade. Its implications on India  at least in the immediate context  look gloomy. If the stock markets underperform, capital raising gets affected. This affects long term growth. But heres the opportunity: In the long run, India could actually stand to gain from the problems that the rest of the world is facing  provided it can get its act together and move ahead forcefully. Thats what we should be focused on. How do we take advantage of the global scenario? We should be pushing the government for more reforms. Demanding why it is not moving ahead rapidly. But does anyone bother about the economy???The real truth unfortunately is we all love politics. We love the tamasha that accompanies politics. There is so much intrigue in politics. In comparison, most people dont understand economics. Thats why it never gets discussed. But we need to realize the dangers of all this. If we miss the opportunities available, all of us will suffer. Its a wake up call. Lets heed it."
190,Strike against  SSB ‘torture’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110810/jsp/siliguri/story_14360424.jsp,2011-08-10,Telegraph,"Manebhanjan, Aug. 9: Residents of Manebhanjan, a town along the Nepal border, started an indefinite strike in the area from today to protest alleged harassment by the Sashastra Seema Bal. The strike was total with traffic coming to a standstill and shops being closed. Roadblocks were set up across Manebhanjan, 27km from Darjeeling. Local traders said the SSB had imposed restriction on the running of vehicles at night. The businessmen said as the vehicles were seized at the checkpost, the agricultural produce could not be taken to the Siliguri Regulated Market and resultantly, they were incurring heavy losses. The SSB started harassing our people for no rhyme or reason a few months ago. They tell us that we cannot ply pick-up vans at night and are seizing vehicles running between 6pm and 6am. If we dont start the journey to Siliguri by 2am, our produce will command very low prices at the market, said Chandan Pradhan. Five pick-up vans stopped by the SSB jawans at the check-post yesterday are still there as the owners have refused to drive away the vehicles. The local people alleged that the SSB jawans were harassing them in other ways also. Even our cattle are stopped by the jawans. We have to register at their check-post every time we move out of Manebhanjan, even if it is five times a day. The jawans even search school students bags, said Raju Pradhan. If we arrive at Manebhanjan after 8-9pm, they force us to leave our vehicles at the checkpost and make us walk to the town at night. They want challan for everything we have bought. But it is not possible to get challans for small items, said Raju. The checkpost is situated a little less than a kilometre from town. Chandan alleged that the SSB personnel were harassing the people for bribes. On every possible occasion, they seek money from the local people and the traders, said Chandan. Manebhanjan is a major centre from where vegetables grown in the Rimbick-Manebhanjan area is collected and sold. Vegetables like cabbages, cauliflower, potato and squash are grown in about 20 villages near Manebhanjan. L.K. Gohian, DIG, SSB, however, had a different take on the issue. Our jawans are not allowing the vehicles to move at night as most of the vegetables are brought from Nepal by the traders. That is why the villagers were insisting on loading at night so that it is not detected by our personnel. The SSB official said people from Nepal could trade only through Pashupatinagar and Panitanki. The customs offices are situated in these two places and if people from Nepal want to trade, they can do so from these two points, but not from Manebhanjan. Gohian admitted that even cattle were being stopped by his personnel. That is because most of the cattle are brought in from the other side of the border. The bribe allegation is totally false, he said. The India-Nepal border is porous and one can step into Nepal from any place undetected. Many believe there is some truth in the villagers allegations. For a very long time, Manebhanjan is known to be supplying vegetables. The villages near Manebhanjan feed Darjeeling to some extent. It is time that the SSB, district administration and the residents work out a solution to ensure that the local peoples produces do not go to waste, said a local official. Gohian said a special village committee had been formed to look into such grievances in the area and the panel would soon sit with the residents to work out a solution."

Now, the specials' are available in the market for all to try.Some of them are exclusive to the Malabar region. The hot, sweet and gooey drink locally called Tharikkanhi,' made of milk, sugar and rava with other ingredients and the hot and spicy drink called Jeerakkanhi,' a mix of rice gruel with different spices, figure on top of the list.While Tharikkanhi' is preferred at the time of breaking the fast, Jeerakkanhi' is eaten around 8 to 9 p.m.Tharikkanhi' is available in most hotels and bakeries in Malabar as is quite popular among people of other religions too.It comes in neatly covered paper glasses and is priced between Rs.10 to Rs.20, depending on the size of the cup.Zains Restaurant, a busy centre for Ramzan specials' in the city, offers snacks such as Unnakkaya,' Pazham Nirachathu,' Chattippathiri,' Meen masala,' Pav chicken' and Kilikkood.'

192,Inflation skyrockets,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/182976/inflation-skyrockets.html,2011-08-11,Deccan Herald,"Last updated: 11 August, 2011New Delhi/MUMBAI, Aug 11, DHNS: 0:52 ISTFood prices at 4-month highFood inflation climbed to a four-and-half month high of 9.90 per cent in the last week of July, increasing the burden on households on the back of costlier onions, fruits and protein-based items.Experts said food inflation is expected to remain volatile, but added that trend in global commodity prices would determine the overall domestic price situation. Food inflation, measured by Wholesale Price Index (WPI), went up to 9.90 per cent for the week ended July 30 from 8.04 per cent.At the same time, according to a survey by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), urban households may expect inflationary pressures to sustain through this fiscal and the first quarter of 2012-13 and may feel there may not be any softening of food prices.While June 2012 household inflation is expected to be 12.9 per cent, up from the 12.7 per cent perceived for March 2012, daily-wage workers and housewives expected higher inflation rates to continue. As per the Inflation Expectations Survey of Households: June, 2011 (Round 24) conducted by the apex bank, the rise will be mainly on account of movement in food prices. It also found that 25 per cent of the respondents surveyed believed that the RBI is taking necessary action to control inflation.Referring to the concerns on inflation, Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said, If it is 9 per cent it is not acceptable...It would have been ideal at 3.5 to 4 per cent ...even if we can keep it at 5-6 per cent (it will not be bad), he said, adding the government has taken steps to check inflation.On the fiscal deficit target of 4.6 per cent of GDP for the fiscal, Mukherjee said (managing) fiscal deficit really challenging job, difficult job...but we have to do it. Prices of onions rose by 36.62 per cent year-on-year, fruits (up 16.49 per cent), vegetables (14.61 per cent) and eggs, meat and fish (13.44 per cent). In addition, cereal prices went up by 6.22 per cent, potatoes by 10.85 per cent and milk by 10.38 per cent on an annual basis.Food inflation is likely to continue to display volatility, on account of perishable items, namely fruits and vegetables, and protein items, led by changing nutritional preferences in the face of an inadequate augmentation of supply, ICRA economist Aditi Nayar said.This is the highest rate of price rise in food items since the week ended March 12, when food inflation stood at 10.05 per cent. In mid-July, food inflation slipped to a 20-month low of 7.33 per cent. While food inflation fluctuates, the real focus would be on headline inflation numbers.The global environment is uncertain and we have seen sharp fall in international commodity prices and if this continues the overall rate of price rise may moderate in the economy, CRISIL chief economist D K Joshi said.Headline inflation stood at 9.44 per cent in June, mainly on account of rise in prices of manufactured items, which have over 65 per cent share in the WPI basket. Prices of commodities, including crude, have fallen sharply in the international markets during the past week ever since Standard & Poors downgraded the United States sovereign debt ratings, which led to meltdown in markets worldwide.As per data released today by the government, primary articles recorded inflation of 12.22 per cent for the week ended July 30, up from 10.99 per cent in the previous week. However, inflation in non-food articles, which include fibres, oil seeds and minerals, fell to 15.05 per cent from 15.60 per cent in the previous week.

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110813/jsp/northeast/story_14372104.jsp,2011-08-13,Telegraph,"Students stage a sit-in at Keishamthong to protest against the indefinite blockade in Imphal on Friday. Picture by UB Photos Imphal, Aug. 12: The Sadar Hills district agitation may snowball into a major law and order problem for the Manipur government with people in both the hills and valley coming out strongly against the dislocation of supplies. The blockade, imposed by the Sadar Hills District Demand Committee, entered its 12th day today, with prices skyrocketing and commodities becoming scarce. Residents of Keishamthong Assembly constituency, a part of which falls in Imphal city, today staged sit-ins at two places to voice their resentment. The sit-ins were sponsored by Keishamthong Humanitarian Development Committee, a new organisation formed by residents of the constituency after the blockade. The sit-ins came a day after Ngamkhohao Haokip, president of the demand committee, announced that the agitation would not be lifted. Prices of essential commodities rose by Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kg and there were reports that some commodities like potato and onion had become scarce. Medicine stocks were also running low. About 250 loaded trucks bound for Imphal are stranded between Mao and Senapati districts since the blockade began. The Senapati District Womens Association also demanded immediate suspension of the blockade, stating it created a humanitarian crisis in the state. This culture of imposing the blockade along the states supply lines by any organisation while making demands should should stop. We are holding the sit-in to support the demand for lifting the blockade, R.K. Shivachandra Singh, chief patron of the humanitarian committee, said. Saying the people of Keishamthong supported the district demand, Shivachandra said the demand committee should adopt other means instead of blocking supplies. School students also took part in the sit-in. I could not pay attention to my studies after seeing my poor parents suffer because of the price rise, said Aribam Binit Sharma, a Class IX student of John English School. Government spokesperson and irrigation and flood control minister N. Biren Singh said the government was planning to re-open the two supply lines of Imphal-Dimapur and Imphal-Jiribam highways after the Independence Day celebrations. The government has decided to deploy security personnel to re-open both the supply lines after the Independence Day celebrations, Biren Singh said. Loaded trucks could not pass through the blockade-hit Sadar Hills areas fearing attacks. Strike supporters kept vigil along the Sadar Hills stretch of Imphal-Dimapur and Imphal-Jiribam highways since July 31 midnight, torching any vehicle violating the blockade. Shivachandra Singh said if the government failed to restore supplies immediately, the humanitarian committee would take an initiative to constitute a forum of civil society bodies to form a human chain from Chandel districts Pallel to Moreh, the border town, to turn to Myanmar and beyond."

At that time, police came to the conclusion that he and his supporters would commit a cognizable offence and there could be likely breach of peace and they decided to take action under Sections 107 and 151 of CrPC,"" home minister P Chidambaram said.But it was not a case of whether Anna was going to break a law. It was about the moral offensive he was launching, running down the government as an entity incapable of delivering a genuinely effective anti-corruption Lokpal. This is the issue at hand that the government's spokespersons have only partially addressed.After deliberations, including a meeting of the cabinet committee on political affairs, and faced with a united Opposition, HRD minister Kapil Sibal and I&B minister Ambika Soni said they shared Anna's concern on corruption. ""We are on Anna's side and Anna is on our side (as far as fight against corruption is concerned),"" Sibal said, adding that the disagreement was over Team Anna's insistence on accepting their bill and no other bill.Chidambaram admitted that there was ""great deal of angst and anger"" among people on corruption and termed the Lokpal as ""not a panacea but one of the answers"" to deal with the menace. The government line was shared by the Congress, which felt that tackling Anna's movement carried the inherent risk of painting the government as favouring the corrupt because the aam aadmi, suffering daily hardships, was unlikely to be drawn into legal niceties.The tricky issue manifested itself in the form of Anna's judicial custody, with party leaders saying it was bound to be seen as another government act of persecuting the veteran leader. The ruling party was hoping that Anna would be set free after arrest. But the court decision to send him to jail gave another issue to civil society to agitate against. Anna's late night release appeared targeted at blunting this criticism that the government had to face both in Parliament and outside.With corruption having a strong resonance with the aam aadmi, there is a realization that it will be tough to deal with Anna while not being seen to be soft on corruption. Many felt the need to act fast on anti-corruption measures, with delays proving costly. The Lokpal bill itself is set to stay beyond the monsoon session of Parliament, providing a reason for the government's opponents to rally around.The anti-graft momentum had allies like the Samajwadi Party and the RLD and the Left too joined the BJP-led Opposition ranks to protest Anna's arrest. It showed that painting the Anna agitation with RSS was not cutting ice in the short run, with an SP leader saying it was the party's compulsion to be seen with the popular opinion. While BSP stayed away, the SP was not scared into thinking that it could cost support among minorities in the coming polls.In a marked difference from earlier Congress attacks on Anna, Soni said the activist was a ""reputed person"" and the government trusted his word on the protest being peaceful. She, however, said that no one could guarantee that there would not be any problem when such large numbers of people gathered at one place as people seated on a dais do not have control on each and every person participating in an agitation.While echoing similar views, Chidambaram said the only way a law could be made was by legislating it in Parliament. ""But if laws are not to be made by Parliament but by some social activists in a maidan, however well-meaning they are, outside Parliament, then it is beyond my comprehension,"" the home minister said.Chidambaram termed as ""careless"" lawyer Shanti Bhushan's allegation that the Delhi Police was a puppet in the hands of the Centre. ""There would be different conditions for different venues, whether the restrictions are reasonable or not can be decided in a court of law,"" he said, adding exhorting government employees to take mass leave was a ""wrong call."""

Located on the second floor of Fun Republic in Andheri (W), finding this eating joint isnt hard. The beige seating and walls devoid of textures might seem a little drab and lacking in character. Also, theres somewhat of a clash between the themes of country-western and Afro-American jazz heritage in the dcor. So you have a lasso and saddle n guns hung on the wall sharing space with trumpets, a saxophone and models of jazz players. The restaurant is trying to achieve a TGIF pan-American feel in its interiors.The foodThe best part about the place is that the food prices displayed on the menu are inclusive of VAT and service tax something that will bring a smile to your face. Among the starters and finger food options, we ordered Charcoal Grilled Cilantro Chicken (Rs 199). The chicken was excellently marinated and barbequed to a juicy finish  definitely a must-have at this joint. But the Indian Spiced BBQ Mushroom Cottage Cheese in Tortilla (R 149) gets a thumbs down from us for its lack of flavour and taste. For the main course (the restaurant boasts of plated main course options), the Grilled Jamaican Jerk Chicken (R 299) served with paprika herb cream sauce was enjoyable for the delicately flavourful rice it is served with.Since not many restaurants feature shepherds pie on their menu, we were glad to find it here and hoped for a culinary delight. But even though the Old Fashioned Shepherds Pie (R 399) did not really disappoint (the lamb mince was near perfect), the thick layer of cheese topping it (where did all the yummy mashed potato disappear?) was a turn-off. So we had to scrape the mashed potato from the other side of the cheese layer to satisfy our taste- buds. Out of the two dessert options available on that day, the Italian Cassata (R 79), with its triple layers of strawberry, nuts and mousse was just average.Since we went on a Wednesday, when the establishment hosts its weekly Karaoke night, we had plenty of space to occupy ourselves. There is also a mini-stage at a prime spot in the restaurant, and the manager informed us that there are plans for live acts such as stand-up comedy and music performances.

While onions were priced at Rs.22 a kg in retail markets as against Rs.18 kg on Wednesday, potatoes came for Rs.20 a kg. Retailers also reported that many households purchased more than the usual quantity apprehending further increase in the prices if the transporters' strike begins as announced from Thursday night.Traders at the Koyambedu wholesale market said vegetables supplies from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have dwindled in the past few days as many of the lorry drivers wanted to return to their home town before the strike in southern States. It takes three days to transport the produce from northern States, they added.S.Chandran, a wholesale trader, said the increase in the prices could be significantly higher if the strike prolongs for more than a day. Usually, the market receives vehicles from across the State and other parts of the country between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. Some lorry owners have promised to transport loads an hour or two beyond Thursday midnight, he said.Another trader V.R.Soundararajan said the wholesale prices of vegetables have gone up by at least Re.1 as some lorries from other States stopped coming a few days ago. The prices of a few vegetables, including cabbage and beetroot, remain stable. The State government must sanction permission to bring produce to the market using other modes of transport if the lorry strike happens, he said.Retailers in areas such as Kilpauk and Triplicane said they have little option than to charge the customers more as the wholesale prices have gone up by Rs.2 a kg. S.Thirupathi, a retail vendor in Mogappair, said I sold tomatoes for Rs.13 a kg today. Many vegetables were priced at least Rs.4 more a kg than yesterday. If the Koyambedu market does not get its daily quota of vegetables for more than a day, retailers like me would have to charge double.Meanwhile, the Confederation of Surface Transport of Tamil Nadu president R.Sugumar said: We are not participating in the strike and have hence decided to operate lorries in Chennai and the neighbouring districts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. But, we have represented to the All India Motor Congress to call for a nationwide strike to seek a reduction in diesel price and toll charges.If the Southern India Motor Transport Association goes ahead with the strike plan, goods traffic from other parts of the State would be affected, he said.The members of the confederation, Mr. Sugumar added, met Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Thursday, who assured them that terminuses to park lorries would be opened in all districts and the educational eligibility norms to obtain lorry driving licence would be relaxed."

However, the strike has not affected the price of foodgrains and pulses since the stock in Bangalore is expected to last for at least a week.Prices of fast-moving essential commodities such as sugar, potato and onion rose a bit since the supply chain has been affected, said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association.Allaying fears over the strike affecting the prices of foodgrains and pulses immediately, he said that the stock could last for at least a week. According to Mr. Lahoti, APMC in Bangalore, in this season, gets about 200 lorry loads of potato, 80 to 100 loads of onion and about 20 loads of sugar, all of which have been affected.In contrast, the lorry strike could benefit vegetable consumers here, as supply to Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Pondicherry and far off places like Mumbai and Kolkota have been affected. If the strike continues, prices of a number of vegetables grown around Bangalore could come down, said R.V. Gopi of Bangalore Wholesale Fruits and Vegetable Merchants Association. Vegetable supply will not be affected as farmers around Bangalore normally use tempos and small autos to transport their produce to the markets here.Meanwhile, the Transport Department has constituted to a State-level task force committee in the office of Transport Commissioner and district-level task force committee and control room at the district level for ensuring uninterrupted movement of essential commodities during the strike period. A release said that these committees will function round-the-clock. Public and lorry owners may contact the control room at the Transport Commissioner's office on 080-22352434, for any assistance."

In pursuit of its decades-old demand to upgrade Sadar Hills in Senapati to a full-fledged revenue district, the self-explanatory Sadar Hills District Demand Committee has been imposing economic blockade on NH 39 and 53 since August 1. The committee is also currently calling an indefinite general strike in Sadar Hills, predominantly inhabited by the Kukis. On the other hand, the United Naga Council (UNC) has imposed an indefinite bandh on all highways, including NH-150, in the Naga-dominated areas from the early hours of Sunday.A conglomerate of several Naga civil bodies of Manipur, the UNC said the total bandh was called against the state government's alleged attempt to bifurcate the ""Naga areas"" to create new districts. ""We will not accept bifurcation of Naga areas without the Nagas' consent,"" the UNC said. Owing to the strikes, traffic along the three key supply routes was paralyzed. Ahuge number of passenger buses, private vehicles and trucks loaded with essential commodities were stranded beyond Manipur's boundaries in Assam and Nagaland. Though the state government has begun arranging traffic under heavy security cover along the deplorable NH-53 (Imphal-Silchar route), many passengers opted air passage to avoid attacks along the route by the agitators. On Saturday, over 800 empty trucks left for Silchar along the route to bring essential commodities to the state. Some of the trucks were damaged as strikers threw stones at them despite security cover.The intensified agitation has triggered an acute commodity crisis in the state, forcing the common people to rush for foodstuff and essential items to meet their daily demands. In the grey market, the rate of a litre of petrol has shot up to Rs 130, while one has to shell out Rs 1,100 for a filled LPG cylinder. Prices of other essential commodities, including potato and onion, have also doubled up in the market."

She said that seeds of French beans of poles varieties would be supplied to the households in addition to the seeds of carrot, potato and tomatoes. Organic manure would also be supplied to the farmers.Agriculture officer Prince Joseph said that the Kerala State Seed Development Authority would supply hybrid seeds to the farmers.One of the reasons for farmers shifting away from vegetable cultivation was the lack of availability of quality seeds and it would be ensured that enough seeds are supplied on time for mass harvest during this December-January season, he said. Cool season vegetables are most suited to the topography and climatic conditions of the grama panchayat.The project will begin in September. It will not only generate additional income to the farmers, housewives also will be involved in the project,'' she said. The project titled Complete vegetable development scheme' would help meet household needs, in addition to inculcating the habit of vegetable farming in the younger generation.The panchayat, with the support of the forest department, had earlier launched a scheme among the tribals to involve them in vegetable cultivation. Vegetables produced by them are already being supplied in the open market. Though the vegetables produced were organic and of high quality, it could not be marketed effectively due to the small shape and poor colour.Now with everyone involved in the projects and the grama panchayat itself taking the responsibility of procurement and supply through the panchayat open market, it is expected that quality vegetables could be supplied at a lower market rate, Ms. Chacko said."

It was over 14 per cent in the corresponding week of 2010.As per the data released by the government today, onion price soared by 44.42 per cent year-on-year, while potato became 16.39 per cent more expensive during the week.Fruits became dearer by 27.01 per cent and eggs, meat and fish by 13.37 per cent on an annual basis.""The bad news is that inflation has increased... On the inflationary front, it is disturbing... I am more concerned about food inflation, which is perilously near double digits,"" Mukherjee told reporters here.During the week ended August 13, price of milk was up 9.51 per cent, while vegetables and cereals became dearer by 6.52 per cent and 5.22 per cent, respectively.Mukherjee, however, said assessment should be made only after looking at long-term trend and that not much should be read in weekly inflation numbers.""As I have always maintained, weekly inflation figures are variant. We should make an assessment on the basis of a relatively longer period,"" Mukherjee said.Meanwhile, experts said another rate hike by the Reserve Bank is likely as pressure remains both on food and non-food item prices.""Inflation remains at an elevated level. We expect the RBI to continue with its monetary tightening and hike key policy rates by another 25 basis points at its September 16 mid-quarterly review,"" Crisil Chief Economist D K Joshi said.Headline inflation, which also factors in manufactured items, fuels and non-food primary items besides food, stood at 9.22 per cent in June.The RBI has already hiked interest rates 11 times since March 2010, to tame demand and curb inflation.Joshi said while pressure on certain food items like pulses will ease further, pressure will remain on some others like milk.As per latest data, while most food items became expensive, pulses became cheaper by 5.56 per cent and the price of wheat was down by 2.80 per cent year-on-year.Overall, primary articles recorded 12.40 per cent inflation for the week ended August 13, up from 11.64 per cent in the previous week.

Adherence to them will open up a huge market of high value, joint advisor of the council, Dr Hari Prakash told The Times of India on the sidelines of the workshop. Similar workshops will follow in Jaipur and Nasik, he said.The council has already prepared a draft of GAP and is waiting for a go ahead from Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The standardisation has been necessitated with the Food Safety Act (FSA) coming into force early this year. It is also believed to be a pre-requirement for retail chains to directly source farm produce from the farmer.The training programme started ahead of government proposing 51% foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail in its approach paper on July 25. A section in the government feels that retail FDI will bring down prices of commodities due to elimination of middlemen in the economy.The council officer said a farmer will have to approach a certification agency and may have to spend between Rs 200 and Rs 500 per acre for certification and inspection.A potato exporter from Jalandhar, Jang Bahadur Singh Sangha, told TOI that Europe was not allowing his produce to be sold in their market."
207,Dhaka awaits Singh sops ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110826/jsp/business/story_14426464.jsp,2011-08-26,Telegraph,"Singh: Trade talksNew Delhi, Aug. 25: India is likely to allow the import of most of the 61 items from Bangladesh that are barred from entering the country. An announcement could be made during Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Bangladesh next month.Bangladesh has long complained that trade with India was grossly unequal with India selling about $3 billion in goods to Bangladesh against the latters half a billion dollar business in jute, ammonia and garments.A year back, Bangladesh had demanded that the 61 products, mostly readymade garments and jute produce, be taken off the negative list of goods.Top officials said India would allow most items on the list after Bangladesh reworked it earlier this month to meet New Delhis demand that only products made in Bangladesh (and not mere assemblies of Chinese or Southeast Asian goods) should enjoy a duty-free or low-duty status.We have changed the list of items slightly so that it reflects value-added Bangladeshi produce, Bangladesh commerce minister Farouk Khan told The Telegraph.Officials said mild steel rods, bar angles, lubricant oils and potatoes had been added to the list, which includes readymade garments such as trousers, skirts, cotton nightshirts, pajamas, swimwear, tracksuits, besides natural rubber, toilet or facial tissue, paper or paperboard labels and silk fabrics.We are looking forward to the Indian Prime Ministers visit and the signing of agreements. There has been a lot of progress on trade issues between the two countries... many non-tariff barriers which we were concerned about have been resolved, said Khan.Bangladeshs industry chambers claim they face high Indian non-tariff barriers, including compulsory testing of all exports, delays and poor infrastructure at border crossings, limited transport routes and hassles in obtaining Indian business visas, which increase business costs for them.Finance ministry officials said Singh who is expected to announce swapping of border enclaves, sign the sharing of Teesta river waters while at Dhaka, could also announce the trade sops as a unilateral gesture of goodwill.Earlier attempts to accede to the Bangla request had been stalled by tough lobbying by Indian textile mills, most of them located in the Tirupur-Coimbatore-Salem-Erode belt."

Fruits were also more expensive by 27.01 per cent while the prices of protein-based edibles such as eggs, meat and fish also went up by 13.37 per cent. Alongside, price of milk was higher by 9.51 per cent and cereals also turned 5.22 per cent dearer.Disturbing, says PranabCommenting on the food price spiral, Mr. Mukherjee said: The bad news is that inflation has increased ... On the inflationary front, it is disturbing ... I am more concerned about food inflation, which is perilously near double digits. However, he noted that weekly numbers do not show a long-term trend. As I have always maintained, weekly inflation figures are variant. We should make an assessment on the basis of a relatively longer period, he said.Irrespective of a definite trend, there is clear evidence of price pressure on both food and non-food items and in such a scenario, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to go in for another hike in key policy rates next moth to douse inflationary expectations. Inflation remains at an elevated level. We expect the RBI to continue with its monetary tightening and hike key policy rates by another 25 basis points at its September 16 mid-quarterly review, Crisil's Chief Economist D. K. Joshi said.However, even as the apex bank has already upped its key rates 11 times since March last year to contain the price spiral, headline inflation still stands pegged at a high of 9.22 per cent for the month of June this year.The WPI data shows that the only food commodities which turned cheaper were pulses and wheat the prices of which declined by 5.56 per cent and 2.80 per cent, respectively on a yearly basis. Overall, while primary articles' inflation was pegged at 12.40 per cent during the week, up from 11.64 per cent in the previous week, inflation in non-food articles, including fibres, oil seeds and minerals, stood at 17.80 per cent as against 16.07 per cent in the previous week."

Along with other vegetables, the increasing prices of potato and onion have added to the woes of customers. According to market insiders, short supply of vegetables from other states and erratic rains have contributed to the price rise.""Orissa largely depends on neighbouring states for vegetables. In the last few days supply of vegetables from other states has gone down. Besides, due to rain a huge quantity of vegetables have perished, leading to the price rise,"" said Gayadhar Swain, secretary of Rajdhani Haat Byabasayee Sangha. ""The local production is not adequate to meet the demand of big customer bases like Bhubaneswar and Cuttack,"" he added.The prices of all vegetables, including snake gourd (potala), spine gourd (kankada), brinjal, bitter gourd (kalara), ladyfinger, drumstick, beans, papaya, pumpkin and tomatoes, have almost doubled in the past one week.""Vegetarian people are facing more problems as we cannot do away with vegetables nor can we afford them at the present rate. So we are forced to cut down on the quantity of vegetables we consume. For example, earlier I was buying at least one to two kgs of parval but today I bought only half a kg. Now with the increasing onion prices, one cannot even manage with onions only,"" said Sanghamitra Dash, a resident of Ashok Nagar area.Duryodhan Sahu, a retailer in Unit-I market here, said, ""The customers are blaming us as of making profits at their expense. The wholesalers have increased the price and since we are buying vegetables at a higher rate we are forced to sell at increased prices. Compared to nearly 80 to 100 trucks of vegetables coming to the city daily, only 30 to 40 trucks have been coming, but the demand remains the same. The prices are bound to go up."""
210,Hurricane Irene leaves U.S. battered,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hurricane-irene-leaves-us-battered/article2407255.ece,2011-08-29,The Hindu,"Having cut a path of destruction that stretched from the Outer Banks of North Carolina to the eastern tip of Long Island in a 24-hour period that killed at least nine people in five states and caused an unprecedented shutdown of the transit systems in Washington, Philadelphia and New York, a weakened but still ferocious Hurricane Irene, now downgraded to a tropical storm, set its sights on a battened-down New England late Sunday morning.To the south, millions of residents were trying to pick up the pieces left in the storm's wake.In North Carolina the state that took the first, hard hit from Irene residents woke up to a sun-drenched morning and ventured out to assess just how much damage she brought. The hurricane, which hit the coast Saturday morning with sustained winds of 136 kmph, was well on its way north by late evening, leaving a state soggy but grateful the damage wasn't worse.The flooding picture was better on Sunday than feared the day before, but state and federal officials said they still do not know the extent of Irene's damage.I think the cost is going to be significant, said Gov. Beverly Perdue. On Sunday morning, more than 225 roads and 21 bridges remained closed, blocked by trees and flood waters or to keep travellers from dangerous conditions, said an official . More than half a million people remained without power. Workers at 56 shelters housed more than 4,600 people overnight.Water rescues dominated the weekend. All told, swift water rescue teams pulled 76 people from the water. Nine people were rescued from flooded homes in Northampton County, which is inland and near the Virginia border.Though the storm weakened throughout the day on Saturday, it continued to funnel storm surge and flood water to the Jersey shore overnight, where the National Hurricane Center said the centre of the storm crossed over land near Little Egg Inlet, north of Atlantic City, at about 5:35 a.m. Even before Irene was downgraded to a tropical storm, federal, state and local officials along the East Coast strongly recommended that people not be fooled into complacency by the gradual decrease in the hurricane's maximum wind speed. They said a central concern was the storm surge of such a sprawling hurricane the deluge to be dumped from the sky or thrown onto shore by violent waves moving like snapped blankets.With the anxiety of the storm gone, days of response and cleanup begin.Downed and denuded trees. Impassable roadways. Damaged municipal buildings. Widespread flooding. The partial loss of a modest civic center's roof, forcing the relocation of dozens of people who had found shelter there.Damage assessments will begin in earnest. About 3 million people were reported to be without power, including more than one million in the Washington area.The hurricane contributed to at least nine deaths on Saturday. In Maryland, a person in Queen Anne's County died after a tree fell on a house, The Associated Press reported. Five people died in North Carolina, including a man installing plywood on the windows of his home in Onslow County who suffered a heart attack. Three died in car accidents died. One man in Nash County was killed when a tree limb fell Saturday. Three more people died in Virginia: in Newport News, a fallen tree crashed through the roof of an apartment building and killed an 11-year-old boy; in Brunswick County, a tree fell on a car and killed a man; and the most recent death was caused by toppled trees.Flooding was reported all along the Eastern Seaboard. In the sounds and bays of eastern North Carolina late Saturday as the storm surge that had swept water inland began to wash back into coastal communities. Parts of the Outer Banks were impassable because of sound-side flooding, and the water was said to be chest-high in Manteo, an island town just across a bridge from Nags Head.Evacuees were told that they were not allowed to re-enter Dare County, where Nags Head is located, until damage assessments were completed.In Virginia, authorities began re-opening roads and lifting curfews, though arterial roads like the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel were expected to remain closed well into the day on Sunday. Several bridges were closed to traffic during the storm.Early Sunday, according to the Associated Press, more than 2.3 million customers were without power from North Carolina through parts of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. In North Carolina, the communities of Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach struggled with flooding, while Atlantic Beach dealt with a pier's partial collapse. And just outside the port city of Wilmington, the dangerous weather conditions forced the police to suspend the search for a teenage boy who had jumped off a boat ramp and into the churning waters.Power was out for about half of Wilmington's 106,000 residents. At the New Hanover Regional Medical Center, several dozen children had spent the night in sleeping bags and inflatable beds, arriving with staff members who had to work and parents from the area who wanted a safe place to wait the storm out.After a night of fierce winds that gusted to nearly 128 kmph, people emerged from their homes to downed trees, darkened traffic lights and a collective sense of having been spared the worst of the storm's wrath.Up to this point, most people had experienced Hurricane Irene only through the multicolored radar maps that appeared on television. Or maybe they had seen the breathtaking, even humbling, images arriving from some 320 kmph, via the International Space Station: the photographs taken by astronauts that showed what looked like a massive swirl of mashed potatoes straddling the edge of the green plate of the United States.

The diseases that devastated potato and ginger crops in Hassan district have affected tomato as well. Besides, shortage of labour makes the cultivation more challenging. It would cost around Rs 10,000 per crop for the farmers."

215,Food inflation on a double-digit diet,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110902/jsp/business/story_14454570.jsp,2011-09-02,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Sept. 1: A spike in onion prices has pushed food inflation to the double-digit zone after a gap of over five months, fuelling fears of an RBI rate hike at its policy meet on September 16. The central bank, in its attempt to bottle the price genie, has raised its key policy rate 11 times since April 2010, with a particularly sharp prod of 50 basis points on July 26 that had shocked industry. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today took the attack against prices beyond the RBIs demand management measures to removing supply irritants. Food inflation has gone up. This is really disturbing. We shall have to ensure and remove the supply constraints on food items, Mukherjee said. Food inflation touched 10.05 per cent for the week ended August 20, riding on costlier onion, vegetables, fruits and protein-based items. The last time food inflation crossed 10 per cent was in the week ended March 12. Data showed prices of onion rising 57.01 per cent year-on-year and potato going up 13.31 per cent during the week under review. Fruits became dearer by 21.58 per cent and vegetables by 15.78 per cent on an annual basis. Prices of protein-rich items  egg, meat and fish  were up 12.62 per cent, while milk and cereals became dearer by 9.22 per cent and 4.64 per cent, respectively. However, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the PMs economic advisory panel, said: I expect food inflation to come down in the coming weeks as the monsoon has been good. We are almost towards the end of the monsoon and all indications are that the agricultural production will be good during this year. Onion menace Plagued by corruption scandals, the UPA government has another hoodoo in its hands in the form of soaring onion prices, which have led to the fall of state governments in the past. According to data available with the department of consumer affairs, the retail prices of onion in major cities in the country have risen by at least Rs 10 per kg since June. Traders said onion price would continue to move upwards on the back of rising demand during the festive season. The UPA, fearing a repeat of last years crisis, when onion prices had soared to Rs 90 a kg, has increased the minimum export price to $300 per tonne. It had removed the ban on onion export in February. Economists attributed the jump in food inflation to seasonal factors, and said the continued inflationary pressure on the economy could again force the Reserve Bank to hike interest rates during its mid-quarter monetary policy review scheduled on September 16. With headline inflation remaining well above 9 per cent, we expect the RBI to raise key policy rates by 25 basis points at its next mid-quarterly review, Crisil chief economist D.K. Joshi said. According to a report by consulting firm Deloitte, Inflation is unlikely to subside in the near term, and the Reserve Bank of India will probably continue raising interest rates until inflation stabilises around 6 per cent. Overall, primary articles recorded 12.93 per cent inflation for the week ended August 20, up from 12.40 per cent in the previous week. Primary articles have a share of over 20 per cent in WPI (wholesale price index). However, inflation in non-food articles, such as fibres, oilseeds and minerals, stood at 17.19 per cent, down from 17.80 per cent in the previous week. According to data, fuel and power inflation was at 12.55 per cent for the week ended August 20, down from 13.13 per cent in the previous week. Food inflation was in double digits for most of 2010 but started to moderate from March this year."

According to data culled from the government and commodity futures exchange, the spot price for 100 kg of potatoes is Rs 418, which traders are betting could rise to Rs 588 towards the end of March. It is quite possible that in the coming months, the gap could get narrowed down and traders would lower their price expectations. Besides, there could be a possibility of traders taking speculative positions though there is no information with the government at present.Gram is the other commodity where some price build-up is seen but December contracts do not reflect the market reality given that the new crop will enter the market after that and prices would cool down.In futures trading, traders - who could include farmers as well as wholesalers - try to hedge there risks by betting on the future price of commodities. At present, the shortest contract is the one maturing on September 20, which, in most cases, suggests a marginal decrease in prices.Rice seems to be the only exception but that seems to be due to the harvest season. Typically, prices rise as the harvest season nears as stocks come down. However, given the abundant stocks in warehouses, there is no scarcity of grains in the country.In the past, futures trading was often blamed for rise in prices in the spot market. Critics, led by politicians, said futures trading was causing speculative trading. But recent actions by the regulator have checked malpractices although the government is guilty of stopping trade in several farm products."

The humble beans, including the guvar and choli, consumed by the Gujarati households, hover at Rs 80 per kg. Brinjals, considered a no good vegetable, too is available at Rs 60 per kg. Onions and potatoes remained the two vegetables in the affordable range selling at Rs 20 and Rs 15 respectively.Vegetable market sources said that the rains have contributed in two ways to the short-supply of vegetables in the market, leading to price rise. The past week of moderate to heavy rainfall has adversely affected the vegetable harvest in the state. At the same time, heavy rains in the neighbouring states like Maharashtra also affected the influx of the vegetables in the local markets.""It will take a couple of dry days for the vegetable supply to be back to normal,"" secretary of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) N I Chasatia said.Wholesale vegetable dealer Hirabhai Patel said that while prices of greens generally fluctuate in monsoon due to impact of rains on harvest and supply. This monsoon, housewives are feeling the pinch more so because the base prices were already high.Patel's opinion finds credence in the fact that even the wholesale prices of greens have risen by 100-200 per cent in the past one year, a survey of vegetable prices on September 1, 2010 and September 1, 2011 revealed.""No green is sold at less than Rs 40 per kg in the retail market. With prices rising further, buying greens has become a problem for the middle class,"" said Patel."

Food inflation had last hit double digits five months ago.Food prices have remained volatile in recent weeks after displaying easing signs for a few weeks.Onion prices are again proving to be a problem. The latest data shows onion prices shot up 57.01% year-on-year, fruits 21.58%; egg, meat and fish 12.62%; vegetables 15.78% and potatoes 13.31%.Experts say heavy rains in the onion growing areas in Maharashtra might have hurt supplies, while the spurt in vegetable prices was attributed to seasonal factors.""Food inflation has gone up. This is really disturbing,"" Mukherjee told reporters. ""Inflation is always a matter of concern and we shall have to ensure that supply of food items improve,"" he said.The government had announced some measures when food inflation hit double-digits last December, but the impact of these steps are yet to be felt. Experts say there is an urgent need to step up productivity as demand is far outstripping supply. Changing food habits and increasing disposable demands have pushed demand for protein-based items such as milk, eggs, meat, fish and poultry.""Major structural reforms are needed. Fruits and vegetables should be taken out of the APMC Act and then you can reduce the margins and pass on the benefits to the consumers. Commission has to be reduced,"" said Ashok Gulati, chairman for the commission on agricultural costs and prices. He said there was a need to bifurcate the mandi system.Earlier this year, a top government panel had said that there is a need to revise the agriculture produce market committee (APMC) Act to encourage competition among traders and also promote efficiency in retailing as some of the steps needed to calm inflation. But there has been limited movement on this front.The finance minister has also said the government will take up the issue of revising the APMC Act with state governments. Mukherjee, in his budget speech, had highlighted the need for state governments to review and enforce a reformed APMC Act urgently to prevent spike in prices of vegetables and fruits.Gulati said immediate steps should be taken to shore up the supply chain by involving domestic and foreign players to reduce wastage of fruits and vegetables.The sharp rise in food prices in the past few weeks presents a fresh challenge to the UPA-II already battling a slew of corruption charges and facing a slowing economy. Global economic uncertainties have also added to its woes.The index for food articles group rose by 1.2% to 195.0 from 192.7 for the previous week due to higher prices of poultry chicken (5%), fruits and vegetables and river fish (3% each), ragi, jowar, egg and gram (2% each) and fish-marine, moong, pork and bajra (1% each). However, prices of barley (1%) declined.Economists say the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is again likely to raise interest rates when it reviews monetary policy later this month as overall inflation still remains far above the central bank's comfort zone. Now, overall inflation hovers around 9%, and is expected to remain high for the next few months before easing to about 7%-8% by the end of the financial year next March.The RBI has raised interest rates 11 times since March, 2010, to calm stubbornly high inflation and has identified taming inflation as its top policy priority. It has said it is ready to sacrifice some growth in the short-term to tackle price pressures."

Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party chairman Bhim Singh has said the Assembly cannot interfere with the process of law.Let the House resolve that Afzal Guru be granted amnesty, on humanitarian grounds, against the death sentence granted to him by the Supreme Court of India for his alleged involvement in the October 13, 2001 attack on Indian Parliament, reads the resolution moved by S.A. Rasheed, Independent MLA from north Kashmir's Langate constituency.Inspiration from T.N.Mr. Rashid told journalists here that he expected all parties to support his resolution. Stating that he was inspired by the Tamil Nadu Assembly passing a resolution seeking commutation of death sentence of three persons convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, the Independent MLA said: The Assembly should in reality reflect the aspirations of the people and those are that people who want he [Guru] should not be executed. The Assembly should not be confined to fix the rates of potatoes and onions.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti told The Hindu : We have already appealed to the President to grant clemency to him [Guru] when the Home Ministry had forwarded the case to her. Her spokesman Naeem Akhtar wanted Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, who is the leader of the House, to move the resolution so that it was passed. Mr. Akhtar referred to Mr. Abdullah's tweet about Guru and said, he started this and he should take it to logical end.The NC and the Congress, however, are tight-lipped and no leader was ready to comment on the issue.But, Mr. Abdullah stood his ground on his tweet that had the J&K Assembly passed a resolution against the death sentence given to Guru as was done by the Tamil Nadu Assembly for the killers of Rajiv Gandhi, the reaction would not have been as muted as it was now.This had drawn a sharp response from the BJP, which dubbed Mr. Abdullah's comments unfortunate.Double standardsSpeaking to a news channel, Mr. Abdullah said he stood by his comments on Guru and the response to his tweet was just a reflection of the double standards on Kashmir.Hitting back at the BJP, the Chief Minister asked why the party was not burning effigies of Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal for seeking clemency in the Devinder Singh Bhullar case. The President had rejected the amnesty of Bhullar, who is on death row.Bhim Singh's pleaMeanwhile, Dr. Bhim Singh had asked the Speaker not to admit the resolution. The resolution as it reads is not admissible for the reason that it starts: Let the House resolve'. The word let is not in the appropriate form.He said: Secondly, the resolution further adds that, His alleged involvement in the attack on Parliament', which is tantamount to defiance of the final verdict of the Supreme Court of India. The word alleged cannot be accepted as part of valid resolution.In his letter to Speaker, Dr. Singh said: Finally this matter does not pertain to the State of J&K. Acts done outside the State of J&K do not fall within the competence of the Legislative Assembly of J&K. Besides, the matter is pending before the honourable President of India and therefore the Legislative Assembly cannot interfere with the process of law."

The rate of price rise of food items was 14.76 per cent in the corresponding week of 2010.As per data released by the government today, prices of pulses fell by 1.56 per cent year-on-year, while wheat became cheaper by 1.04 per cent during the week ended August 27.However, other food items became more expensive during the week under review.Onions grew dearer by 42.03 per cent on an annual basis, while potato prices were up by 13.38 per cent during the week under review.Fruits became 16.57 per cent more expensive and overall, prices of vegetables shot up by 22.42 per cent on an annual basis in the week ended August 27.The prices of eggs, meat and fish were up 7.26 per cent, while milk and cereals became dearer by 9.12 per cent and 5.45 per cent, respectively.The fall in food inflation could be attributed to a moderation in the rate of price rise of some of the items on a week-on-week basis, even though they continued to go up.In the previous week ended July 30, the rate of price rise of items like onions, vegetables, milk and cereals was more on an annual basis in comparison to the week under review.The decline could also be attributed to the high inflation rate of over 14 per cent in the corresponding year-ago period, a phenomenon dubbed the 'high base effect' in economic parlance."

Prices of onions surged by 42.03 per cent and potatoes by 13.38 per cent on an annual while vegetables, as a whole, were 22.42 per cent dearer.Alongside, fruits were 16.57 per cent costlier, as were milk and cereals by 9.12 per cent and 5.45 per cent, respectively.With little respite from the price spiral, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee hoped that food prices would moderate after the festive season while expressing his concern over the rising prices non-food and fuel items. During the festive season, there will be some fluctuation [in food prices]. But after that, moderating influence will continue, he said.Significantly, inflation in non-food articles, including fibres, oilseeds and minerals, was pegged at 19.88 per cent for the week, up from 17.19 per cent in the previous week while the inflation index in the fuel and power segment stood unchanged at 12.55 per cent.Accounting for a 20 per cent share in the WPI basket, inflation in primary articles was also higher at 13.34 per cent for the week ended August 27, up from 12.93 per cent in the previous week.Noting that the price trend in non-food and fuel segments was not encouraging as yet, Mr. Mukherjee said: Though food inflation has come down ... [inflation of] other items have increased substantially, particularly the non-food primary articles, which is not at all encouraging  Fuel prices are still a cause of concern, and oil is hovering around $115 a barrel. I do hope it will be possible for us to have some moderation with the international economy's trend. But it is difficult to predict that right at this juncture.A plausible reason for the dip in food inflation, according to experts, could be the moderation in the rate of price rise of some items such as milk and vegetables on a weekly basis even as the overall trend is to move northward. Coupled with the weekly price variation could be the high base effect on an annual basis as food inflation was at a high of 14 per cent during the corresponding week a year ago."
225,"Ban on onion export, off wheat",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110909/jsp/nation/story_14484657.jsp,2011-09-09,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Centre tonight banned onion exports to check rising retail prices, re-imposing the curbs only six months after it lifted them following a dip. At the same time, it lifted four-year restrictions on overseas sale of wheat and non-basmati rice to ease storage problems following record production last season. Onion exports have been banned with immediate effect. The ban will be reviewed on a fortnightly basis, food minister K.V. Thomas said after a meeting of a ministerial panel headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. Governments have been voted out over high onion prices. The Congress-led UPA, wary of a repeat of last years crisis when prices of the politically sensitive kitchen staple topped Rs 90 a kg and prompted the last ban, does not want to take chances before next years Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand polls. Onion prices have increased to Rs 25 per kg in retail markets in recent weeks from Rs 15 per kg a month ago because of erratic supplies. Food inflation numbers for the week ended August 27 showed onion prices rising 42.03 per cent year-on-year and potato by 13.38 per cent, though the overall figure for all items dipped to 9.55 per cent from over 10 per cent the week before. Pulses and wheat became less expensive. The ban was clamped by the ministerial committee a day after the directorate-general of foreign trade, a government agency under the commerce ministry, raised the minimum export price (MEP) for onions to $475 from $300 per tonne in an attempt to discourage exports. The hike in the minimum export price, the fourth since June 18, followed fears of sharper increases in retail rates because of a delay in sowing of the crop in Maharashtra, which is the countrys largest onion-growing state, and reports of hoarding by farmers, trade analysts said. Food minister Thomas had said after reviewing onion prices earlier this week that the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (Nafed) and National Co-operative Consumer Federation of India (NCCF) would sell the vegetable at Rs 20 per kg through their retail outlets in Delhi. State governments have also been asked to undertake such market-intervention measures through their agencies, an official statement had said. On wheat and non-basmati rice, the ministers committee decided to allow exports of two million tonnes of each item. Their prices have remained relatively stable and the government is grappling with storage problems on the back of record grain production. A government official hinted at another reason. The international prices of wheat are going up. So there should be some exports, he said. In early July, the panel had given in-principle approval for wheat exports but did not decide the quantity as global prices were low then. India is estimated to have harvested a record 85.93 million tonnes (mt) of wheat and 95.32 mt of rice in the 2010-11 crop season (July-June). Wheat export was banned in early 2007 to augment buffer stock when the output had fallen. Now, government godowns are overflowing."

The bank's next mid-quarterly policy review is scheduled for September 16.India Inc has said the string of rate hikes, which have raised the cost of borrowing, have acted as a dampener to fresh investment and hindered growth.Industrial production plunged to a 21-month low of 3.3 per cent in July. Meanwhile, economic growth during the April-June period stood at 7.7 per cent, the slowest expansion rate in the past six quarters.Both the government and the RBI have projected headline inflation to remain elevated till the third half of the current fiscal, mainly on account of pressure from international commodity prices."

But due to diversification of agriculture, growers are unable to meet their basic requirements by sowing just these two varieties.Lahaul produced 1.50 lakh and 1 lakh potato bags (each weighing 50kg) in 2009 and 2010 respectively. As per an estimate, 5-10% production drop is expected this year. Traders from across the country have been offering Rs 550 for a bag of potatoes.A potato cultivator in Patan valley of Lahaul, Som Dev, said, ""Our crop is generally purchased for seeds but this time, many small traders are buying the potatoes for table use. Harvesting is in its initial stage and we hope for stable rates throughout the season, as only a few growers have sown potatoes this season,"" he said.Another farmer Ram Lal said that a Canadian company had introduced a new variety of potato seed in 2010 but the entire crop rotted due to heavy rains. Most farmers shifted to cauliflower and broccoli cultivation instead.Managing director of Lahaul potato growers' cooperative marketing-cum-processing society (LPS) Amar Dogra said, ""Around 10% farmers are not growing seed potato this year. Prices of table potatoes are touching the sky and traders have been purchasing seed potatoes to sell those in the vegetable markets. Farmers are working hard to send their produce to Kullu for grading, before snow blocks all highways to Lahaul."""

However, he admitted that it will take some time before prices of essential kitchen items like onion and potato decline.""We may have seen the peak as far as monthly inflation rates are concerned with the release of figures for August 2011 yesterday. Here onwards we should see a gradual moderation in monthly headline inflation,"" Mukherjee said on the social networking site Facebook.Headline inflation had touched 13-month high of 9.78 per cent in August.""Inflation in certain commodities like onion and potato are still a concern. The steps that we have taken will have some moderating influence but it is taking time and it will continue for some time,"" Mukherjee said while talking to reporters.Onions were dearer by 43 per cent on an annual basis, while potato prices were up 21 per cent, as per latest data.The government, last week, put a ban on exports of onion, which is available between Rs 10.75 per kg and Rs 12.80 per kg in the wholesale markets here. Retail prices of onion in the NCR region are at Rs 20-25 per kg.During the week under review, prices of pulses fell by 2.45 per cent year-on-year, while wheat became cheaper by 2.03 per cent.

Primary articles have a share of over 20 per cent in the WPI.Inflation of non-food articles, which include fibres, oilseeds and minerals, stood at 18.49 per cent during the week under review compared to 19.88 per cent in the previous week.Meanwhile, fuel and power inflation went up to 13.01 per cent from 12.55 per cent in the previous week.""The inflation is on higher side and the worrying part is the increase in index numbers of the non-food articles. The WPI numbers released yesterday also point towards higher inflation in terms of the absolute numbers,"" financial service firm KASSA director Siddharth Shankar said.Experts, however, are of the view that despite the latest fall, pressure on the price front continues and is expected to keep the government and the Reserve Bank on their toes.The Reserve Bank has already hiked policy rates 11 times since March 2010, to tame demand and curb inflation."

It (inflation) is perilously close to double digit...RBI is also watching the situation like the government and collectively it would be possible for us to tackle the problem, Mr. Mukherjee told reporters here.His comments came as headline inflation soared to 9.78 per cent in August, from 9.22 per cent in the previous month, because of rising prices of food and manufactured items. Of course, in the overall environment, all over the world it was expected that inflationary pressure would rise in all groups including manufacturing (segment), he said. This is time of stress not only in India but all over the world and we shall have to maintain our nerves and we shall have to see how we can overcome the problem, he added. The RBI is scheduled to announce its mid-quarterly monetary policy review on September 16.  PTISujay Mehdudia reports:Dampening growthChief Economic Advisor in the Finance Ministry Kaushik Basu said there was no black and white answer and the RBI would have to balance between controlling inflation and dampening growth. Inflation for June has been revised upwards to 9.51 per cent from the provisional estimate of 9.44 per cent, according to official data released on Wednesday. In August, food items on annual basis became expensive by 9.62 per cent, driven mainly by rising prices of onion, fruits and potato.

231,'No fall in food prices till Nov',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/No-fall-in-food-prices-till-Nov/articleshow/9987251.cms,2011-09-15,The Times Of India,"GURGAON: If the fact that overall inflation is nearing double digits is 'uncomfortable' for the government, here is some bad news for the common man. The sky-rocketing food prices may not fall before November or December.A forecast by the department of Agricultural Economics of CCS Agricultural University, Hisar, shows that the wholesale prices of items like potato, green peas and black gram will see some reduction in wholesale prices by the year-end. Based on the opinion survey of the traders and the analysis of the last 10 years' prices, a department spokesperson said that the price of potatoes is expected to range between Rs 600 and Rs 620 per quintal this month and the trend is likely to continue till November this year. Only in December, the price may come down to Rs 575 to Rs 590 per quintal and that would happen due to the arrival of fresh potatoes in the market.This is a clear indication of household expense will continue to go up for the next two months with the prices of vegetables also increasing substantially. He added that considering this trend, the farmers might take a decision accordingly to sell their stored stock and also how much area they want to bring under potato cultivation in the coming season.The analysis also predicts that the prices of green peas are also expected to range between Rs 2,250 and Rs 2,300 per quintal during October. However, in November and December, its price might decline to Rs 1,700 and Rs 1,250 per quintal respectively. The sharp fall in prices in December would be on account of more arrival of green peas from Haryana and the adjoining states as well.Similarly, the prices of rapeseed and mustard may range from Rs 2,500 to Rs 2,560 per quintal during October and in November and December, the prices might hover around Rs 2,550 and Rs 2,580 per quintal. It's not very different in the case of black gram. Next month the wholesale price of black gram (channa) may range between Rs 2,350 to Rs 2,400 per quintal and there will not be much difference in its prices between Rs 2,360 and Rs 2,425 per quintal. Though the wholesale prices of food items don't seem that pinching for consumers, when these items are sold in the retail market, their prices are much more.The government may calculate the inflation in a fraction of the percentage, but even a small increase has huge ramifications on the large population."
232,Soaring Food Prices Spark War In Kitchen Cabinet,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thelostmaven/war-in-the-kitchen-cabinet/,2011-09-15,The Times Of India,"Sept 15, 2011: Inflation touches one-year high. Food prices galloping. This blog was written before petrol prices were hiked on Thursday evening. It only makes the agony worse.The Kitchen Cabinet was in a state of ferment. No one was sure on whom the axe would fall next. The steep price rise was giving Indians plenty of food for thought. It was forcing many to skip any thought of food. No fruit or vegetable, neither fish nor fowl wanted to be banned from the dining table for something beyond their control. Things had become so bad that even traditional pot-mates were calling each other names. The knives were out.The Kitchen Cabinet decided to call a meeting to cool the simmering tension and debate who could stay on and who was priced out of the kitchen. All seemed to have an inflated opinion of themselves. Each wanted to curry the Home Ministers favour, no matter what the cost.As things came to a boil, the Egghead asked the Pressure Cooker to blow its whistle. Order! Order! Every memberfair and lovely or dark and stringywill be given a minute to plead their case, no more. Do I make myself clear? There were cries of dissent, but eventually the meeting got underway.First to speak was the formerly humble Aloo who now considered himself a Hot Potato. No Indian household can survive without me. Jab tak rahega parliament mein Lalu, tab tak rahega kitchen mein Aloo. I rest my case.You are just a gasbag, an ulloo said the Brinjal who was bruised black and blue by the soaring inflation. At Rs 50 a kilo, I put the bang in the bhartha. Okay, so the children dont like me, but adults just adore me, she said.The Bhindi rose on her dainty feet. Did you know the ladyfinger is the PMs favourite vegetable? How can anyone even think of barring me from the common kitchen?The emaciated Beans were followed by the pale-looking Beetroot. The Carrot and the Drumstick spoke as one. Then came the Gawars and Gourds who blew their own trumpets bitterly. The Leafies wilted visibly, the Onion wept copiously.This meeting is such a waste of time, sniffed Cool Cucumber. Yeah, plebs will be plebs, said the Zucchini, turning up his nose. Lets have our own kitty party, sang the Asparagus and the Iceberg Lettuce. Aye, muttered the Shelled Peas enthusiastically as they made a dash for the Freezer.Wise Old Cabbage then spoke up: Its no use fighting among ourselves. Let us take out a protest march in Delhi. Let us see if the powers-that-be can do something.Soon, the streets of the national capital were awash in a sea of green, red, brown, white and what have you. The protesters came from far and wide, they came in all shapes and sizes. There were Ripe Old Bananas from Kerala and Tender Young Spring Onions from Punjab. There were Corpulent Bhoplas from Bhopal, Thin Tendlis from Nashik. Also stirring the pot were the Elite Lentils from the North and the Janata Dals from the East. The animal kingdom was represented by Bombay Duck, Hyderabad Goatee and Chicken Chettinad.The protesters carried a variety of banners: Kill High Prices That Are Killing Us; Down With The Government; War on Pawar; Where There Is Food There Is Life; Eliminate The Middleman, Protect The Consumer; Strike Down The Transporters!In a corner of the morcha, a clutch of innocent baby potatoes held up a placard: Forgive Our Sins, Save Our Skins.The army of fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat, spices and oils marched to 7 Race Course Road, where they were halted by a bigger army of security guards. The ministers are in a meeting, no one can enter, they said. Even the hand-picked delegation led by Wise Old Cabbage was denied permission to meet the Union Kitchen Cabinet.Finally, the government spokesperson came out and addressed the consumables: Price rise is a global phenomenon. We are helpless. So the government has decided to emulate Anna Hazare and Narendra Modi and go on a sadbhavana fast with all starving Indians. Go back, we have no use for you now.Trusting the government, the poor souls went back to the common mans kitchen. Things can only get better, said Wise Old Cabbage who was well versed with the supply-demand theory. If every Indian fasts for at least one day a month, there will be more of us. The more our supply, the lower will be the demand for us. Lower the demand, lower will be our prices. Lower the prices, more people can afford us. Understood?Meri maa ki roti! What if things dont improve, asked the strapping Sarson-da-Soil. What do we do then?Wait for 2014. And show the ruling party that during general elections, even cabbages can be kings, said Wise Old Cabbage with a smile."

The hike will cost the exchequer Rs 7,229 crore for a full financial year.But since the latest revision has been made effective from July, the burden for the current financial year will be Rs 4,819 crore.Dearness allowance is revised twice a year, on January 1 and July 1.The relief came a day after inflation hit a 13-month high of 9.78 per cent in August, much above the 5-6 per cent range the RBI terms comfortable.Food inflation fell marginally to 9.47 per cent for the week ended September 3 from 9.55 per cent in the previous week, but the level is still considered too high. Prices of most items have continued to rise, with onions dearer by 43 per cent on an annual basis and potato by 21 per cent.A key employee union suggested the DA hike was long overdue. The inflation index, which is the basis of calculating the DA, had not been actually reflecting the true cost of living and erosion in employees remuneration due to the price rise, K.K.N. Kutty, secretary-general of the Confederation of Central Government Employees and Workers, said.Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has sought to calm price fears by saying the government had taken steps whose results would be felt after some time.Inflation in commodities like onion and potato is still a concern.

The counter-blockade came after blockade supporters torched six Imphal-bound trucks, including two carrying medicines, at Nungkao village in the hill district of Tamenlong yesterday. The six were part of a convoy of about 1,000 trucks, which were being escorted by Manipur Rifles and IRB personnel from Jiribam to Imphal. Blockade supporters hurled petrol bombs on the trucks, damaging six vehicles completely. The securitymen fired in the air but no injuries were reported. Eyewitnesses said this morning around 100 women turned up at Khumbong along the Imphal-Jiribam highway in Imphal West district and stopped the loaded trucks that were passing by. They emptied 20 trucks when they discovered that the goods were being transported to Tamenglong. On getting information about the counter-blockade, police arrived on the scene and fired smoke bombs and tear gas shells to disperse the protesters. The goods were taken to Patsoi police station in Imphal West. A protester said, Trucks coming to Imphal are being stopped and set on fire. The whole state is suffering because of the blockade. Prices of commodities are skyrocketing and goods have become scarce. So, why should we allow goods to reach those who are imposing the blockade? Currently, 1kg of potato costs Rs 40 and 1kg of onions Rs 60 here. Prices of other daily essentials have also spiaralled after the blockade. People have to stand in long queues in front of fuel pumps, sometimes for a whole day, to buy a few litres of petrol. The Sadar Hills District Demand Committee first enforced the blockade from July 31 midnight on Imphal-Dimapur and Imphal-Jiribam highways to press for creation of Sadar Hills district out of Senapati district. The UNC then imposed a blockade along these supply routes from August 21, demanding non-inclusion of Naga villages in the proposed district."

A rise of Rs 3.14 in petrol price from Thursday has given an excuse to vendors to increase vegetable prices, though there seems hardly a logical link between the two.The domino effect of petrol price hike have ensured high inflation in the coming days. Onions in the wholesale market on Thursday cost Rs 12 per kg but have now reached Rs 15 despite good supply at the Muhana Mandi from Nashik. Similarly, potato prices in the wholesale market were lingering between Rs 6 to 6.50 per kg for the past few days, but have moved to Rs 8 on Friday.The retail market for vegetables, which is mostly in the unorganised sector, saw price rise on the very first day after petrol prices were hiked even though retail vegetable movement do not depend much on petrol.The price of cauliflower has seen sharp increase - touching Rs 50 from Rs 47 a day earlier. Ladiesfinger is now being sold at Rs 40 -- an increase of Rs 2. Shoaib, a vegetable vendor in C-Scheme, says, ""Prices of vegetables will increase with petrol prices as nothing is isolated. We have a family and need to sustain ourselves.""Interestingly, the major players in the organised retail sector haven't increased their prices. An official at a retail shop in the organized sector said, ""We don't pass on prices to our customers until we get them at higher rates from the mandi. The fact is that most vegetables are transported in trucks which run on diesel. So there is no need for a sudden hike.""Rambabu Agarwal, fruit and vegetable trader at Muhana Mandi, also feels the same way. He says, ""Prices of vegetables and fruits actually depend on supply and demand. If on any day, more trucks come in then the prices fall and when supply is low, they go up. Petrol prices play a minimum role in deciding vegetable and fruit rates"".But not every vegetable vendor shares the view. Narayan Das says, ""If at all there is any effect on vegetable prices, it can be seen only after three to four days and not immediately. But I don't think vendors will consider petrol price as a reason to increase their rates."""

Members of Conflict Widows Forum, Manipur, highlighted their woes before the media as the economic blockade sponsored by the Sadar Hills District Demand Committee entered the 40th day today. Another blockade imposed by the United Naga Council since August 21 against any move to divide Nagas land while creating Sadar Hills, has crippled the supply of commodities. The worst sufferers of the blockade are widows struggling with their children without support either from their relatives or in-laws. The worst sufferer is Kongkham Gangarani Devi, 36, of Imphal East. Completely blind, she returned to her parents after her husband was killed. She has a separate kitchen for her and her two minor boys. Gangarani Devi survives with a meagre monthly grant of Rs1,500 given by Women Action for Development, an Imphal-based NGO, working for the welfare of women and children. My husband, who was a van driver, was killed by police commandos along with some militants travelling in his van in Thoubal district in 2008. I can no longer afford two meals a day after the blockade and send my sons to school as prices of commodities and school van fares have gone up, Gangarani said, wiping tears. She said she had to skip meals so that her sons could eat. I can no longer buy onion as one kg costs Rs 80. I also cannot buy potato which is sold at Rs 40 per kg. I am living in hell, she said. School vans normally charge Rs 600 per month. Now parents have to pay an additional amount of Rs 20 per day as fuel has become scarce. Most days I cannot send my three children to school as I do not have the additional Rs 60, another widow said. The widows said their sufferings would ease if below poverty line cards were given to them. But they were not getting any as the cards were either given to the heads of in-laws family or heads of the parental home. T. Ambrabati Devi, another member of the forum, said every village having a population of 1,000 people has 30 per cent widow population and these single parents were making do with only one meal per day these days. The number of widows is rising because of the conflict and spread of HIV. Even vegetables grown in Manipur have become costlier. Medicines are not available. In this situation, how can the widows survive? Laishram Ranjita Devi, another member, asked. The widows urged the government to get the blockade lifted in the next few days or face their anger on the streets."

If the general strike is not successful in drawing a response from the Centre, it will be followed by prolonged strikes by various sectors including banking and retail, he added.We support the anti-corruption movement being led by Anna Hazare. But we request that he should also raise the issue of the atrocities being committed against workers and peasants in this country, he added.Mr. Dasgupta, who is also a senior leader and MP of the Communist Party of India, was also critical of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for not doing anything to curb rising prices.Mamata Banerjee is playing to the galleries, he said referring to her visit to a vegetable market to inquire about various prices. He added that prices of various essential commodities have gone up, like that of potatoes by 21.16 per cent and of tomatoes by 42.98 per cent over the last 15 days when there is no scarcity in the market."

The only solace that the WPI provided to the common man was that food inflation during the like week in 2010 was way higher at 16.30 per cent. In other words, it is again the statistical anomaly of a high base effect that has come into play to show a decline.As per the WPI data, barring wheat prices which slipped by 2.72 per cent, all other edibles were more expensive on a year-on-year basis. Prices of onions, for instance, were higher by 29 per cent while potatoes were 13.78 per cent dearer and vegetables, as a whole, were 12.13 per cent costlier.To add to the consumers' misery, milk prices were up again by 10.38 per cent."

The term was coined by Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault and Nissan, to describe the automotive engineering that went into Tata Motors Nano, a small car that retails for just over Rs 1 lakh in India.Tata itself sometimes refers to its low-cost innovations as Gandhian engineering in honour of Indias Independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, a renowned proponent of self-sufficiency. Over the past few years, India has gained a reputation for creating a wide range of products sturdy enough to handle its demanding environment, easy enough for a wide range of people to useand most importantly, affordablefrom solar-powered ATM bank machines to a detergent requiring little water. But getting these mean, lean products to consumers is not as easy as distributing them in the developed world.One of the earliest and most simple business process innovations was started by a south Indian health and beauty company, Velvette, in the 1980s. Keen to reach Indians who aspired to use shampoo but could not afford to buy a bottle of it, Velvette began putting small quantities, enough for one or two washes, into plastic sachets.The idea spread. Multinationals such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble, which distributes Colgate products, adopted it. Now in small shops throughout India you can find streams of sachets dangling from crowded shelves and filled with anything from detergent and cough syrup to potato chips and mobile phone minutes.The aspiration for these products was there, but consumer money in the pocket to afford a large cash outlay was not there. So success at the lower cash-out lay in these sachets, said Geetu Verma, executive director of Innovation with Pepsico India, which sells small packets of its sports drink powder.In a project called Shakti Amma (empowered woman) that started in 2002, HUL tapped an existing network of womens micro-financing groups, in which women get loans to buy something that can help them earn an income. In this case, the usual cow or weaving loom was replaced with Rs 20,000 worth of HUL shampoos, detergents. Shakti entrepreneurs go from home to home talking about relevant brand benefitslike hygiene and healthcareof our products, Adarsh said.They sell products not only to households but also small village shops and kiosksoften the front room of a family homebecoming a marketing and distribution tool in one go. Today 45,000 shakti ammas push HUL products in India.For many multinationals, doing business in India means being the first to set up new distribution networks that developed countries take for granted. General Electric has 4,000 employees at its research and design facility in Bangalore, many of their products originally designed in the west and being re-engineered for new uses in the India market.One of them is a lightweight ECG machine that can fit in the backpack of a travelling doctor. It can take 500 readings on a single battery charge and costs only a tenth that of a standard ECG machine. When GE Healthcare wanted to sell PET-CT cancer diagnosis machines, it met an unexpected roadblock. Cancer treatment was a relatively undeveloped area of healthcare. India had no national network to make the isotopes necessary for the procedure, never mind transporting them across poorly connected states.Harish Hande took that mindset and the sachet marketing model and applied it to sunshine. Upon returning to India after getting an engineering doctorate from the University of Massachusetts, he set up a company in the mid-1990s that sells small solar panels to India's vast rural poor, most of whom had little hope of getting on the congested power grid.It took four and a half years to get a system in place. But it paid off. His company Selco now reaches half a million people and provides electricity to 120,000 households. Selco was created to destroy three myths: the poor cannot afford technology, the poor cannot maintain technology and you cant run a commercial venture while trying to meet social objectives, Hande said in his solar-lit Bangalore office.Hande has also found a way to sell even smaller quantities of green power. He is encouraging customers to use the solar panels to charge dozens of large batteries a day, load them on a cart and push their way through town, renting them out to street hawkers who use them to light up their stalls at night."

It is finger food and still it is mobile food. Yet it is spicy food. You named it? Yes, it is Vada Pav (A potato mixture sandwiched in between slices of pav). Chennaites very soon will have an opportunity to taste it, according to Venkatesh Iyer, Founder and CEO, Goli Vada Pav.He said young Indian population in the age group of 10 to 21 with their changing lifestyle prefer fast food that too finger food. Many do not have patience to wait at the restaurant as the time taken for processing and serving food takes time. Many multinational companies (MNCs), have opened their outlets to cater to the demand for these types of eaters. Road-side vendors too participated in this rally and made quick money in selling fast food items. Goli Vada Pav, a Mumbai-based ethnic food chain, was set up in 2004, the founders being Venkatesh Iyer and Shivadas Menon.Mr. Iyer said Goli Vada Pav made an entry in Mumbai in 2004. Our major challenges are wastages, pilferages, standardisation, price fluctuations of raw materials and the like to establish the brand. Then the company entered into a contract with Vista Processed Foods, which manufactures burgers for MacDonald's in India. Vista is a subsidiary of the U.S.-based OSI.He said Goli Vada Pav was being manufactured at a fully automated plant in Taloja near Mumbai and conformed to the same standards of any multinational fast food chain product in countries such as Europe and the U.S. There are seven varieties now available in four states, 30 cities and in 125 stores with a price range of Rs.20-35, he said.The CEO said the company received Rs.21-crore funding from VenturEast, a southern venture capital firm, last month and the funds would be utilised towards expansion, improving managerial capabilities, getting methods in place, manpower and a little bit of marketing. He said the company was looking at expanding and spreading its wings. The immediate target was to have a presence in Chennai (a trial store is already operational at Express Avenue) and Coimbatore. In the next 3-4 years, the company was planning to have 150 stores in the south as part of its consolidation effort. It would open another 100 stores in Maharashtra besides expanding in the north."

He is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Imphal.""Until the government provides full proof security to the vehicles along the route, in Thamnapokpi area in particular, and bears all expenses being incurred by the injured driver and compensates for the damaged vehicles, we will not ply along the route,"" said a key leader of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of Imphal-Moreh transporters. The JAC has decided to stop operating the service with immediate effect after an emergency meeting, he said.The leader added that a memorandum highlighting the JAC's demands would be submitted to chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh very soon.Around 200 vehicles, including buses, vans and jeeps, are operating under the JAC.UNC's stir came after the Sadar Hills District Demand Committee (SHDDC) intensified its decades old demand for crating Sadar Hills district. On September 5, suspected UNC-sponsored stir supporters had damaged five jeeps at Thamnapokpi.Meanwhile, the economic blockade on the highway has triggered a sudden fuel crisis at the state capital as all fuel outlets remained closed.People are buying petrol at a steep rate of Rs 100 a litre from the grey market even as a delegation of Kuki leaders, including legislators, are currently camping in New Delhi to press for their demand to upgrade Sadar Hills in Senapati to a full-fledged district.The ongoing economic blockade on the two key supply routes from August 31, coupled with an indefinite general strike in Kuki-dominated Sadar Hills, has already triggered a mild inflation in the state. The price of an LPG cylinder in the grey market is Rs 800 and the prices of onions, potatoes and some other vegetables have also doubled."

That assertion, made by chief minister Narendra Modi, summarizes the tone of his speech at 'Annaya Hatavo-Gujarat Bachao' rally held in Vastral on Sunday. Modi said that Singh had been corrupted by the company of other ""experienced"" Congress leaders.""When Singh became the Prime Minister, he was a person with a clean image,"" Modi said. ""But if people like him get spoiled by the rot in the Congress, then we need to remove that rot.""Modi called the Congress the proverbial rotten potato and said that the party had now become a burden for the country. ""I was asked to chair one of the eight committees formed to tackle inflation,"" Modi said. ""The committee submitted the report eight months ago and the PM had acknowledged my efforts. But even after eight months, he has not even opened the cover of my report.""Modi also referred to disputes within the Congress by highlighting how Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and Union home minister P Chidambaram were at loggerheads while the PM was playing the role of a mute spectatorModi attacked the Congress on the issue of corruption and challenged the central government to compete with Gujarat in development. ""Let the Centre and Gujarat government construct a road and then see the quality and speed of construction,"" Modi said. ""I am sure the Centre cannot compete with this state when it comes to quality and speed of development.""Modi accused the central government of treating Gujarat as an enemy. He said the population of Gujarat had increased by 20 per cent but the Centre has decreased the quota of fertilizers and kerosene instead of hiking it to match the increased demand. This, according to Modi, was only to harass the people of Gujarat and drive them to suicide. ""This harassment to Gujaratis has the sole intention of attacking the state government,"" he said.Modi said the Centre was giving CNG gas used in autorickshaws at a higher price to Gujarat. ""The Centre has one price for CNG in Delhi, Mumbai and Jaipur, while the same is given to Gujarat at a higher price of Rs 14 per litre,"" he said. He further said that Centre had constructed 4,000 km of coastal roads, but when it came to Gujarat, not a single kilometre had been sanctioned, not even to connect ports."
246,Vegetable prices rise as supply dips,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Vegetable-prices-rise-as-supply-dips/articleshow/10133628.cms,2011-09-27,The Times Of India,"PUNE: Owing to a fall in supply over the last two days, vegetable prices in the retail market saw a sharp rise. According to commission agents at the wholesale market, supply has gone down in the last few days leading retail prices to shoot up drastically. The supply has been affected as the fresh harvest of vegetables is still a few days away, said the commission agents.Compared to the prices of vegetables supplied locally, such as fenugreek, cabbage, cauliflower and cluster beans, the price of potato, which is supplied from north India, was found to be moderate. Cabbage and cauliflower were sold at Rs 40 per kg and cluster beans at Rs 60 per kg at the market in Narayan Peth. Potato was sold at Rs 15 per kg.Shivalal Bhosale, chairman, the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Commission Agents' Association, at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee, said, ""There is a cycle in prices of vegetables, mainly based on the availability of vegetables from the farmers. If supply goes down for two days, retail prices remain high for 4 to 5 days, as vendors buy vegetables in bulk.""There is no control over supply of vegetables from farmers, as maturation period of vegetables may vary due to climatic conditions, quality of seeds and soil and water availability. The current price escalation is also part of this cycle. The prices will come down in 4 to 5 days, as supply would go up after harvesting, Bhosale said.Compared to vegetables, the shelf life of potatoes is higher; hence its price comparatively remains static, he added. Kunal Rahiwalekar, an IT professional, said, ""The prices are ridiculously high. My monthly budget has completely collapsed. Rise of a rupee or two per kg can be reasonable but now, hardly any vegetable is available for less than Rs 20 a kg."" Ramesh Pawar, a vegetable vendor, said, ""Fuel prices and labour charges for carrying vegetables from wholesale market to our shop have gone up. Diesel is now around Rs 44 per litre. Electricity charges and storage of vegetables add to my costs. I have to sell the vegetables at higher prices; otherwise, I will be running losses.""Sunita Bhave, a housewife, said, ""The rise in prices of vegetables is seriously affecting my family's budget. I even went to the Gultekdi, the city's wholesale market, with my friends to buy vegetables in bulk. This did not help either as we ended up spending money on petrol."""
247,Relief for people after two months,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110927/jsp/northeast/story_14556306.jsp,2011-09-27,Telegraph,"Block-aid Imphal, Sept. 26: The Okram Ibobi Singh government has fixed the prices of commodities, mostly of edible items brought from outside the state, giving the blockade-scarred people of Manipur a much needed respite. As a result, prices of essential commodities have come down. Prices of the commodities were fixed during a meeting chaired by consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister N. Biren Singh and attended by government officials and representatives from the business community of Imphal city on Saturday. Biren Singh took up the steps following severe criticism from the Opposition parties and the public over the failure of the government in checking unprecedented price rise in the state because of the nearly two-month long economic blockade along the supply routes of the state. The prices of edible oil, onion, garlic, potato, mung dal, arhar dal, rice and others were fixed during the price meet. The minister asked the trading community to enforce the new price lists with immediate effect. Following the price fixation, prices of foodgrain have come down from Rs 20 to Rs 10. Yesterday being Sunday, no wholesale shops were open. Wholesalers and retail sellers today said the prices have come down, but differed in retail shops depending on transportation charges. For instance, 1kg of potato which was sold before the price was fixed at Rs 25, is now being sold for Rs 20 to Rs 22. The wholesale rate fixed by the government is Rs 19. Similarly, onion, which was sold at Rs 45 per kg earlier, is now being sold for Rs 40, while arhar dals price came down from Rs 100 per kg to Rs 80 per kg. The fixing of price though late, has given us some relief. But we still have to suffer, as the new prices are still high. The blockade should be lifted and prices should come down to normal, said L. Chandralekha Devi, who came to buy half a kg of onion at an Imphal West retail shop. Prices of commodities soared after the Sadar Hills District Demand Committee-sponsored economic blockade began on July 31 midnight. The supply was severely crippled after the United Naga Council (UNC) enforced another blockade from August 21 to oppose the inclusion of Naga areas in the creation of Sadar Hills district out of Senapati district. At one stage, the price of 1kg of onion was Rs 60 and 1kg of potato was Rs 40. Prices went down after the frequency of arrival of supply trucks with security escorts along Imphal-Jiribam Road increased. The prices were fixed after the BJP and Manipur Peoples Party (MPP) increased their clamour for the dismissal of the Ibobi Singh government, for its failure to end the economic blockade and also protests by students. During the meeting, the business community said it had to increase prices, as transportation charges of the goods had increased by more than double. At normal times, transporters used the Imphal-Dimapur highway but now were being forced to use the Imphal-Jiribam highway with security escorts."
248,What's the buzz.,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/194600/whats-buzz.html,2011-09-29,Deccan Herald,"What's the buzz.Last updated: 29 September, 2011Why potatoes are the king of all vegetablesResearchers have found that white potatoes are the largest and most affordable source of potassium of any vegetable or fruit. The high cost of meeting federal dietary guidelines for potassium, 4,700 mg per person per day, presents a challenge for consumers and health professionals, alike.However, the cost of potassium-rich white potatoes was half that of most other vegetables.Potatoes deserve credit for contributing to higher diet quality and increasing vegetable consumption, said lead researcher Adam Drewnowski, from the University of Washington.Potatoes also play an important role in providing affordable nutrition to Americans. You can afford to meet key dietary guidelines if you include potatoes in your diet, he stated.For the finding, Dr. Drewnowski and colleagues merged nutrient composition data from the USDA Food and Nutrition Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS 2.0) with the USDA Centre for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) national food prices database.Individuals who consumed potatoes (baked, boiled and roasted) had higher intakes of potassium and vitamin C and consumed more total vegetables in a day compared to those who did not consume potatoes.Even slight increase in blood pressure ups stroke riskEven slightly raised blood pressure which is within the normal range increases a persons chances of experiencing a future stroke by 55 percent, according to a new research.Prehypertension is clinical category created by experts in 2003 to describe patients whose blood pressure was elevated, but still considered within normal range. The experts reasoned that, generally speaking, the higher the blood pressure, the greater the risk of death and disease, possibly starting from within the normal blood range, said Bruce Ovbiagele, MD, professor of neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine and senior author of the study.Scientists analysed data on 518,520 adults from 12 studies looking at blood pressure and stroke risk. The results showed that people who had prehypertension were at a 55 percent higher risk of experiencing a future stroke than people without prehypertension.The health risk was measurably greater for those whose blood pressure levels were at the high end of the normal spectrum.Psychosocial stress ups womans breast cancer riskA study has suggested that psychosocial stress could play a role in the etiology of breast cancer aggressiveness, particularly among minority populations.We found that after diagnosis, black and Hispanic breast cancer patients reported higher levels of stress than whites, and that stress was associated with tumour aggressiveness, said Garth H. Rauscher, PhD, associate professor of epidemiology in the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at the School of Public Health, University of Illinois at Chicago.Rauscher and colleagues studied patient-reported perceptions of fear, anxiety and isolation, together referred to as psychosocial stress, and associations with breast cancer aggressiveness.Patients stress levels were examined two to three months post-diagnosis.Results showed that psychosocial stress scores were higher for both black and Hispanic patients compared to white patients. Those who reported higher levels of stress tended to have more aggressive tumours, Rauscher said.Its not clear whats driving this association. It may be that the level of stress in these patients lives influenced tumour aggressiveness.Urban cycling may save the environment, not your lungsIf youre an urban cyclist, a new study reveals a dangerous side effect of this green mode of transport: you may be inhaling high levels of black soot.The new University of London study found that urbanites who cycled to work had 2.3 times more black carbon in their lungs than pedestrians. Black carbon is present in car exhaust fumes and is created by the combustion of fossil fuels. Pedestrians breathe in these miniscule particles of soot, but bikers inhale even more because they are closer to the fumes and take deeper breaths.This could be due to a number of factors, including the fact that cyclists breathe more deeply and at a quicker rate than pedestrians while in closer proximity to exhaust fumes, which could increase the airborne particles penetrating the lungs, said a researcher."

Picture by UB Photos Imphal, Sept. 29: Residents of Imphal city today thronged mobile shops opened by the Okram Ibobi Singh government to procure four food items at cheaper rates. The state consumer affairs, food and public distribution department opened the shops at 10 different places in and around the city for the first time during the two-month economic blockade. The shops are selling potatoes for Rs 15, arhar dal for Rs 56, mattar at Rs 35 and masur dal at Rs 51 per kg and allowed each person to buy 5kg to 10kg of each item. Department minister N. Biren Singh said they had procured items worth Rs 93 lakh from Silchar for distribution among people at subsidised rates in view of their sufferings because of the blockade. He said such mobile shops would be opened at regular intervals at other places as well until the situation improved. Prices of the items sold today were lower than the wholesale prices fixed by the government on Saturday. The wholesale price of potato fixed by the government is Rs 19, mattar Rs 37, masur dal Rs 52 and arhar dal Rs 58 per kg. Despite the government fixing the wholesale prices, people are paying more when they buy the items from retail outlets, who fix their own prices by adding transportation charges from the city to their own shops. I bought 5kg arhar dal and 5kg potatoes. Though the quality of potatoes is not that good, we are happy that the government opened the shops with lower prices, said Thokchom Shyam Singh of Imphal East, who came to one such mobile shop at Lamlong Bazar of the district. The shops, however, witnessed serpentine queues. I had to spend the whole day standing in the long queue. Yes, we appreciate the step taken by the government, but we would be happier if they could end the blockade and restore price normality in the market, Khumanthem Gunarani Devi said, standing in a queue at another mobile shop in the Palace Gate area of Imphal city. People started gathering at the shops since 7.30am, announced by the government through local newspapers. Prices of commodities are high in the state following the economic blockade imposed by the Sadar Hills District Demand Committee since July 31 midnight and the United Naga Council (UNC) since August 21. Though supply trucks are coming with security escorts through the Imphal-Jiribam highway once a week, no adequate supply could be made available in the market to bring down the prices."

Policymakers have been way off the mark while predicting the trend of food prices which have remained volatile for the past several months. ""We shall have to see how to bring it down to a moderate level. I am constantly in touch with the RBI,"" FM said.The data showed pulses prices, which displayed signs of softening in the previous weeks, rose 7.54% in the week to September 24, while vegetable prices were up 14.88%. Potato prices rose 9.34%. The government expects food prices to moderate as supplies improve on the back of a robust monsoon.Inflation has remained stubbornly high and way above the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) comfort level. Overall inflation is near double-digits and the August reading came in at 9.78%. The RBI has raised interest rates 12 times since March 2010 and has said it is ready to sacrifice some growth in the short-term to calm price pressures. Some economists expect it to pause in its rate tightening cycle against the backdrop of the global economic slowdown.The index for food articles group rose by 0.2% to 197.7 from 197.3 for the previous week due to higher prices of fish-inland (13%), gram (4%), ragi, egg, urad and condiments & spices (2% each) and masur, moong, arhar, fruits and vegetables, rice, pork and barley (1% each). But the prices of sea fish (14%) and jowar, maize, tea, bajra and poultry chicken (1% each) declined. The index for the fuel and power group remained unchanged at its previous week's level of 169.4 and the annual rate of inflation, calculated on point to point basis, also remained unchanged at its previous week's level of 14.69%."

Even staples such as cereals and pulses, which had witnessed a decline in prices in recent times, also turned dearer by 4.57 per cent and 7.54 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis during the week.Commenting on the relentless rise in food prices with no signs of its cooling down, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said: Inflation is definitely a matter of concern. We shall have to see how to bring it down to [a] moderate levelI am constantly in touch with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).An additional worry is that headline inflation, which includes manufactured items, fuel and non-food primary articles in addition to food commodities, also stands stubbornly high at 9.78 per cent in August. The apex bank, on its part, has already raised its key policies rates a dozen times since March, 2010, in its effort to shrink demand by making funds costlier and thereby rein in inflation. However, the net result has not been in keeping with expectations.With a reasonable good monsoon this year, the authorities, as also economic analysts, were expecting a cool-down in food prices and a consequent slide in headline inflation. A decline in both counts has been elusive and the only consolation is that food inflation during the like week in September, 2010, was at a high of 16.88 per cent.Given the good monsoon, we were expecting some moderation in the rate of price rise. But it seems not to be happening and there is particular pressure on vegetables and fruits, Crisil's chief economist D. K. Joshi said. He felt that the government needed to improve the storage and cold chain facilities to help ease supply constraints.According to the WPI data, overall inflation in primary articles stood at 10.84 per cent during the week ended September 24 as compared to 11.43 per cent in the previous week. Inflation in non-food articles, including fibres, oil seeds and minerals, stood lower at 10.77 per cent for the week as compared to 12.89 per cent while inflation in fuel and power inflation remained unchanged at 14.69 per cent."

Picture by UB Photos Agartala, Oct. 11: High prices of all essential commodities, including clay idols of the goddess of wealth, and a scarcity of priests have cast a shadow over the Lakshmi Puja festivity across the state today. The impact of countrywide food inflation is being felt more acutely in Tripura than in other places because of problems relating to transport and communication. But over the past year, commodities, including vegetables, fruits, flowers, and other items related to puja rituals as well as clay idols have started selling at exorbitantly high prices. This trend had first come to light during the Durga Puja last year but has gained momentum since then. This time prices are high but what can one do, this is the rule of the market; during occasions like Durga or Lakshmi Puja demand soars but supply remains more or less static and hence prices go up, said Suresh Das, secretary of the Vegetable Merchants Association. But Dass evaluation provides little comfort to harried people who find it difficult to purchase vegetables at double or triple the prices that prevailed a month ago. I have purchased potato for Rs 24 per kg, brinjal for Rs 55 per kg, cauliflower for Rs 65 per kg and tomato for Rs 30 per kg, said Nikhil Banik, an upper division clerk in state secretariat. I have been forced to cut down on a lot of things to manage with the little money that I can spare for the Puja, said Banik. Even the smallest idols are being sold for Rs 100 per piece and goes upto Rs 2,500 for the big and decorated ones. I have bought this small idol of goddess Lakshmi, said Pushpa De, 39, a housewife and a resident of Jaynagar of Agartala. Besides, there is also an acute shortage of priests. I started at 9.30am and I will have to do the puja in 53 households and this will go on till 10pm, said Sajal Chakraborty, a priest. He conceded that he was cutting mantras and rituals short to finish the pujas on time. Chakraborty said with the passage of time many traditional Brahmins have moved away from the profession of priesthood to other occupations. Most of the young men and women do not even know how to conduct rituals and they never care to learn the mantras, that is why you see the crisis. In Bengal, there are schools to train priests but here in Tripura, there is no such institution, he said."

The rate of price rise in food items stood at 17.14 per cent in the corresponding week of 2010.The fall in food inflation could be attributed to a moderation in the rate of price rise for some of the items on a week-on-week basis, even though they remained higher on an annual basis.The fall could also be attributed to the high inflation rate of 17 per cent in the corresponding year-ago period, a phenomenon dubbed the 'high base effect' in economic parlance.As per data released by the government today, vegetable prices shot up by 13.01 per cent, with prices of potatoes rising by 3.79 per cent on an annual basis, during the week under review.In addition, milk became 10.35 per cent costlier and fruit prices rose by 12.19 per cent.

Due to this, Asia's two best varieties of potato seeds - Kufri Jyoti and Kufri Chandramukhi - produced in cold deserts of Lahaul-Spiti have lost its magic in the valley.Now, farmers are concentrating on broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and other cash crops, which apparently have hit the potato production. According to preliminary estimates, potato production in Lahaul-Spiti this year would suffer a loss of 10 to 20 per cent. Farmers are looking for alternate sources of income which in turn will hit the production even worse in future. The high quality potato seed prepared in valley is under threat.A potato grower in Yangrang village of Lahaul, Padam Singh said a 50kg bag of potato is being sold only for Rs 400 which is very cheap. ""In the beginning of potato season, some growers got up to Rs 550 for a bag but prices plunged within a week. We can get only one crop in year due to heavy snowfall in rest of six months. The current price is not doing justice with us. We shall have to find other means of income,"" he said.Situated at height above 10,000 feet, the dry and cold land of Lahaul-Spiti is suitable for potato seed, which is resistant to germs and fungus. Potato farming has strengthened the economy of thousands of tribals. But now they are not happy with prices.Meanwhile, broccoli and cabbage grown in valley are doing miracle with their unique taste and anti -rotting qualities. Not only in local markets of state, but tribal vegetables are doing brisk business in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana.Prem Singh Bhatt, a farmer from Shansha village, who used to cultivate potato said, ""I'm earning comparatively good with cabbage and broccoli. One kg of broccoli fetched up to Rs 300 in Delhi markets. Most of our crops have fell victim of poor connectivity. We cannot survive only with potato. Diversification and experiments are must for farmers.""Farmers in Lahaul change crops every year to maintain the quality of land and cultivate potato and peas one by one. Their livelihood is totally dependent on these crops. After having good results of experiments with cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli, more farmers are expected to adopt vegetable farming next year which will largely hit the potato production.Lahaul potato growers' cooperative, marketing-cum-processing society (LPS) managing director Amar Dogra said, both varieties of potato seeds cultivated in valley is not able to meet the basic requirements of Indian farmers, due to diversification in agriculture. ""Lahaul had produced 1.5 lakh bags in 2009 which was reduced to 1 lakh in 2010. As more than 10 per cent farmers are not growing potato this year, the production may fall substantially,"" he added."

To contain black marketing of fertilisers,we have made 2700 raids at various dealers places and have cancelled the licences of 1700 of them. FIRs have been lodged against 10 dealers and the Vigilance Commission has been told to keep an eye on all dealers of fertilisers, Bhattacharya told The Indian Express.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday spoke to Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee demanding a hike in the support price for jute after her demand for a hike of Rs 400 was rejected by Union Minister of Agriculture Sharad Pawar.Bhattacharya said construction of more cold storages can address the issue of support price for potato. In West Bengal,we need about 60,000 tonnes of potato for our consumption but the produce is about 1 lakh tonne.

No wonder then that there was a rush for the product at Helping Hands Mela, 2011 at a bank here, as Binu Das from Barpeta and Kabita Rabha from Goalpara looked on proudly. The two women, associated with the Foundation for Social Transformation, had put on display 24 varieties of khar. While more common varieties like amitar (papaya), kol (banana), which form a part of the meal for the khar khua Assamiya (khar-eating Assamese), were sold out almost as soon as they were brought, there were other lesser-known varieties that attracted many too. People are unaware that khar can be prepared from many sources. Hence, they demanded more of the common kol khar and amitar khar, said Rabha. The not-so-common khars included those made from potato skin, elephant apple, water hyacinth, coconut fibre and hay. Binu Das also brought out a booklet on the 24 varieties of khar  its sources, method of preparation and benefits. Available within a price range of Rs 10 to Rs 40, a bank official said khar, apart from handloom and artefact products, had been a big hit in the mela since its opening yesterday. The fair was inaugurated by actor Indra Baniya. Aiming to give an opportunity to non-government organisations and communities for selling their products, the mela will continue till October 22. This time, eight NGOs are taking part in the fair. Branch manager of the bank, Sabry Ali said, It is a charitable cause where we dont charge anything from these NGOs. Instead, we invite more NGOs and communities to come forward and take part in this mela. We get in touch with registered NGOs that are involved in handicraft and artefacts made by the underprivileged. Despite being in the business for two years, both Das and Rabha said bottling khar was a hurdle. We have to get bottles from liquor shops and sterilise it. We cannot use plastic containers, but at the same time, getting glass bottles is difficult and costlier. Khar should always be stored in glass containers as it lasts longer, said Rabha. Das recommended that kol khar should be used for washing all cotton and silk apparel. Instead of sending an eri and muga chador for dry cleaning, Das said, All you need to have is kol khar. Washing eri and muga in it not only helps in enhancing the colour but also makes the fabric soft. Apart from the foundation, representatives from Sishu Sarothi, Nedan Foundation, Northeast Network, Dwar Jingkyrmen and others also participated in the mela."

Tomato, bitter gourd, big onions and cow pea (achinga) and mangoes have seen more significant increase in prices.Sources in Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp) said here on Tuesday that vegetable prices were moving rapidly up this week though banana (nendran) was selling low thanks to heavy arrivals from neighbouring Tamil Nadu.Convener of the Vegetables Auction Committee at the Maradu wholesale market in the city, V. P. Kuriakose alleged that traders might be jacking up prices though he said that farmers were getting remunerative prices at the auctions.Scientists at the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, who track vegetable prices, said that there was no apparent reason for the current bout of price rise though slow arrivals could be one.Figures from VFPCK showed that banana (nendran) price had slipped to Rs. 24 kg in the retail market here from the level of Rs. 35-36 during the Onam season, when usually the price of the favourite banana variety spikes in the Kerala market. This is a also a much lower level for Nendran than in September 2010 when price ruled at Rs. 37 a kg in the retail market.Ash gourd was selling at Rs. 16 a kg in the retail market on Wednesday. Bitter gourd was selling at Rs. 46 a kg in the retail market, up from Rs. 16 a kg a month ago.

Retailers claim that a further rise in prices of basic vegetables like tomatoes, onions and potatoes can be expected in the next 10 days.Yet again, the wholesale market claims that prices in the mandi have actually been coming down in the past two weeks. ""There has been some variation in prices but that is a normal process based on demand and supply. Now that winter is coming, we are expecting better quality vegetables and in greater quantity. Prices in general have been falling and we are expecting them to come down further,"" said a senior official of the Azadpur Produce Marketing Committee.The reality, however, is far removed from this at the local markets. In the first week of October, during Dussehra, prices of vegetables like potatoes and tomatoes had gone up by Rs 4-5 per kg. While the wholesale rates have remained the same since then, the retailers have taken advantage of the approaching Diwali season to hike rates. ""Till September, I was paying Rs 35-40 for a kg of tomatoes. On Thursday my maid picked up a kilogram for Rs 50 though the vendor was actually asking for Rs 55. They blatantly accept there is no shortage but then say that everything becomes expensive during festival time and hence the increase in the prices,"" said Sumita Singh, a government official.Asha Mathur, a resident of IP Extension, says that a Rs 100 note can be used to purchase vegetables enough for only a day. ""As it is, expenditure goes up during festival time and to also have to spend more on fruits and vegetables when their prices in the mandi are coming down make you feel angry. My brother-in-law works at the Azadpur mandi and I know that there is no shortage. However, my vendor uses short supply as a constant excuse for increasing rates. Milk, dairy products and fuel are all expensive now,"" she said.Retailers agree that the current cost escalation in only because of Diwali. ""Everything is so expensive and we too need to earn enough to be able to afford a decent festival for our families. A slight increase in per kg costs doesn't mean much to the consumer but we are able to earn a decent amount. In the coming week, potatoes, onions and tomatoes, among some other vegetables, will become more expensive across the city,"" said Pappu, a vendor in east Delhi."

But we have to make immediate payments to labourers and also need cash for purchasing diesel and to pay EMIs for our tractor loans. However, traders are exploiting us, said Bherulal Patidar, a farmer. He had brought dollar chana to the mandi.Farmers Afzal Patel and Jaiprakash Choudhary also made similar allegations.Traders, however, refuted the allegations. A trader Dinesh said they were compelled to make payment in cheques as withdrawal limit for the registered traders is increased to just Rs 50,000.With that meager amount we cannot buy chana in cash, he said.Krishi upaj mandi secretary G K Choudhary said that he would inquire into the complaints and take action if needed.Businesses at some of the major wholesale markets in MP including Choithram mandi in Indore and red chilli mandi in Khargone is limping along due to severe cash crunch following scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.To tide over the situation, the farmers say, transactions are increasingly being done partly in demonetised currencies and partly in new notes, besides credit.In most cases, payments are being made half in new currency notes and half in old currency notes. Lots of commodities are also being supplied on credit, Mukesh Patidar, a farmer, said.Traders at Choithram mandi say business there is down by about 50 percent since the Union governments demonetisation announcement and that is without counting severely hit potato-onion trade.To keep the vegetable supply chain running, the commission agents, who act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders, are dealing in both scrapped notes and credit.While affluent farmers always supply goods on credit, the small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Today, there is shortage of new currency notes and not all farmers accept cheques, a commission agent, who did not wish to be named, told HT.The potato and onion market in Choithram mandi has been closed for the past one week and is expected to reopen on Monday.Farmers in Bedia in Khargone district, the red chili hub of Madhya Pradesh, are also facing similar problems. The commission agents are offering about Rs 1,000 per quintal more if farmers accept old currency notes, said Krishanpal Singh, a farmer.However, Khargone mandi secretary V K Choudhary said that payments are now being made by cheques and any complaint of exploitation of farmers will be dealt with strictly."

Prices have shot up three to four times, according to officials.""The chief minister and Governor Gurbachan Jagat have repeatedly urged the agitators to withdraw the blockade,"" a government official told reporters here Saturday.The Sadar Hills District Demand Committee (SHDDC) began the indefinite road blockade on NH 53 and NH 39 that links the northeastern state with the rest of the country. They are demanding that the Sadar Hills sub-division in the Naga-dominated Senapati district in northern Manipur be upgraded as a full-fledged district.Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Home Minister P. Chidambaram in New Delhi last week and discussed the blockade impasse with them.""But the SHDDC refused to call off the blockade reiterating their demand that the district should be created first,"" the official added.Government spokesman and Minister N. Biren Singh admitted that the blockade has created a severe shortage of essential commodities, including diesel and petrol.People have to wait in long queues in front of petrol pumps, sometimes for an entire day, to buy a few litres of fuel, he said.Currently, a kg of potato costs Rs.40 to Rs.50 while a kg of onions is Rs.60 to Rs.70.Biren Singh told reporters that the government was trying to move essentials and fuel through trucks with security escorts.""Several hundred trucks loaded with essentials and oil tankers are on way to Imphal,"" the minister added.The United Naga Council, the apex body of Nagas in Manipur, has also been organising a counter road blockade in all Naga-inhabited areas in northern Manipur, demanding that these areas should not be carved out without their consent.The main opposition parties including Manipur People's Party (MPP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been demanding president's rule in the state to normalize the situation.The parties have been organising sit-ins here.""Party leaders met Governor Gurbachan Jagat several times seeking his intervention to get the blockade lifted in view of the suffering of people.

The Karnataka Pradesh Krishik Samaj had organised the rally.The protesters staged a demonstration in front of the Deputy Commissioner's office urging the Centre to purchase potatoes and onions directly from farmers through the State Government. In the past fortnight, prices of potato and onion have dropped drastically in the domestic and international market. While the price of onion has crashed from Rs. 1,300 to Rs. 400 a quintal, the prices of the onion have fallen from Rs. 1,200 to Rs. 600 a quintal. The sudden dip in prices has landed farmers in trouble and has led to distress selling of the produce, according to the protesters.In the entire Dharwad districts, farmers of Hubli and Dharwad taluks were affected more than the others because they had opted to grow onion and potato as the region had received good rainfall during the kharif season.The farmers have taken farm loans and invested huge amounts to grow the crops. On an average, each farmer has invested a minimum of Rs. 10,000 per acre. Now, the fall in prices of onion and potato has shattered the dreams of the farmers that they would get good returns for the produce. Besides the fall in prices, inadequate storage facilities in the region has led to distress selling, the protesters added.The protesters urged the State and the Union Governments to come to the rescue of the farmers."

Farmers in the district have lost over 90 per cent of the potatoes that they had kept at the Morya Dhawaj Cold Store. According to sources, around 12,000 sacks have been kept at the cold store since March. Each bag contained about 50-60kg of potatoes. Around 2,500 bags have been found containing rotten potatoes. Hanuman Chaudhary, a farmer from Makrampur village, said: I had kept 2,500kg of potatoes at Morya Dhawaj Cold Store since March 25. Yesterday, I went to the store to take out stock for sowing. But I found that more than 95 per cent of them were rotten. Chaudhary added: One of the employees asked me to pay Rs 4,050 as rent for storing the potatoes. The owner of the cold store, Manoj Singh Yadav, said: Around 2,500 bags of potatoes have been found rotten because of leakage of ammonia at the plant after the September 18 earthquake. We took a week to repair the pipe. He added: We will pay the tillers Rs 300 per quintal after deducting rent and labour costs. Most of the rotten potatoes belong to farmers.

High prices of milk, egg, meat and pulses also kept pressure on food inflation, which rose to the highest level in over six months, the government data showed Thursday.Food inflation figure for the week ending October 8 was 10.60 per cent.The price pressure on perishable items, particularly fruits, meat, milk, eggs and fish continued due to supply mismatch with the rising demand of such items. The imbalance has worsened by rising rural wages and consequent demand pressure from rural India and the absence of growth in agricultural productivity.Fuel prices have indeed contributed to food price hike. Although crude prices have declined in recent times on the international market, the benefit has been offset by the fall in the value of the Indian rupee. The rupee breached Rs 50 a dollar last week, making imports especially crude oil costlier, fanning fears of higher inflation and widening of the subsidy bill of the cash-strapped government.Besides, there are structural factors contributing to high food inflation in India, such as, the creaking food distribution and storage system. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has taken steps in the past and raised key policy rates as many as 13 times in the past 12 months to tame inflation, but they have had little impact on arresting food inflation.On the contrary, costlier loan has hampered the economic growth rate in the first quarter of current fiscal.According to RBI Governor D Subbarao, lower production of pulses and inadequate supply of protein-based food may put further pressure on food prices in the near term.Pulses became dearer by 9.06 per cent and cereal prices were up 4.62 per cent year-on-year for the week under review. But the effect of good monsoon and the governments efforts to manage the demand and supply mismatch appeared to be yielding results in some areas with wheat prices for the week under review coming down 0.95 per cent. Onion also became cheaper -- close to 19 per cent and a downward movement was also seen in potato prices. The primary articles price index was up 11.75 per cent, compared with an annual rise of 11.18 per cent a week earlier despite RBIs continued efforts to raise key policy rates to tame inflation.The Central bank raised rates for the 13th time on Tuesday to fight inflation that topped 9 per cent for nearly a year. The government and policy makers are of the view that headline inflation will start moderating from December and come close to 7 per cent by March 2012. The WPI inflation, which stayed above 9 per cent this year, climbed 9.72 per cent in September.Searing the pocket* Food inflation for week ending Oct 8 was 10.60 pc* Prices of vegetables have surged 25 per cent* Fruits costlier by about 12 per cent* Pulses have become dearer by over 9 pc and cereal prices by nearly 5 pc* Prices of milk, egg, meat and pulses have also gone up* Low production of pulses and inadequate supply of protein-based food may putfurther pressure on food prices"
277,Food cost tastes foul ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1111028/jsp/business/story_14676276.jsp,2011-10-28,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Oct. 27: A spike in the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk has pushed food inflation to a six-month high of 11.43 per cent for the week ended October 15, putting pressure on policy makers to think of alternative measures to contain it as monetary tightening had not yielded the desired results. While vegetables became 25 per cent costlier on an annual basis, fruits grew dearer by 11.96 per cent, milk by 10.85 per cent and eggs, meat and fish by 12.82 per cent, food inflation data released today showed. Food inflation, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), was at 10.60 per cent in the previous week. The double-digit inflation comes on top of a very high level of price rise recorded in October last year, when it stood at 14.20 per cent  already a high-base comparison. The last time that food inflation stood around this level was on April 9 when it was 11.53 per cent. The rising food inflation is a serious matter. Rate hikes did not seem to have the desired effect as seen in the high headline inflation. Issues of supply constraint have to be addressed, Crisil chief economist D.K. Joshi said. Pulses and cereals, which had remained subdued in recent months, have started catching up and became expensive by 9.06 per cent and 4.62 per cent, respectively, on an annual basis. However, onions became 18.93 per cent cheaper and prices of wheat and potatoes were also down 0.95 per cent and 0.45 per cent, respectively, year-on-year during the week under review. With vegetable prices unlikely to ease until after the festive season, food inflation may remain elevated in the remaining weeks of October, Icra economist Aditi Nayar said. Food prices have remained high for several months, driven by growing demand for high-protein diets, which is the result of more income at the hands of the rural people partly because of the governments job guarantee programme. Adding to the woes is the inefficient distribution system, which causes frequent supply disruptions. Analysts attributed the increase in food prices to a host of factors which range from poor logistics to the festival season. A long-term approach to contain food inflation needs to be put in place with better logistics and cold storages."

Alongside, eggs, meat and fish were also costlier by 12.82 per cent.What is hurting the common man all the more is that this fresh bout of double-digit inflation is over and above the 14.20 per cent spurt witnessed during the same week in October, 2010. In effect, there is no statistical anomaly of base effect in play in the current surge in prices which is very close to the high of 11.53 per cent recorded for the week ended April 9 this year.Dearer ediblesMore disconcerting for the authorities is the fact that edibles such as pulses and cereals  prices of which had eased in recent months  have started to become more expensive and turned dearer by 9.06 per cent and 4.62 per cent, respectively, on a yearly basis.Items which tended to cost less on an annual basis, however, were onions with their prices declining by 18.93 per cent while wheat and potatoes also turned cheaper by 0.95 per cent and 0.45 per cent, respectively.In a way, the spurt in food inflation, which has a significant share in the overall price spiral, vindicates the rate hike and the policy stance taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In its annual review, the apex bank had estimated headline inflation to remain high till December this year before tapering down to about 7 per cent by the end of the fiscal year in March, 2012.Noting that real wage inflation has extended into the first quarter of the current fiscal, the RBI, in its second quarter review said: Food inflation is likely to stay elevated due to demand-supply mismatches in non-cereals and large MSP [Minimum Support Price] revisions.Significantly, headline inflation, which also accounts for the price surge in manufactured items, has hovered above 9 per cent since December, 2010 and stood pegged at 9.72 per cent in September this year."

Telegraph picture Bagaha, Oct. 28: Sugarcane growers in the district have set a November 9 deadline for the government, the day chief minister Nitish Kumar embarks on his Sewa Yatra, to complete the inquiry into the alleged misappropriation of their money by a sugar company. Over 2,000 farmers were allegedly duped of about Rs 40 crore by the West Champaran-based Tirupati Sugars Limited on the pretext of procuring smart cards for them during the 2009-10 crop season. The smart cards were supposed to be used for getting seeds and fertiliser. Instead, the company, as a guarantor of the farmers, allegedly procured Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) in connivance with the Bagaha-branch of a nationalised bank. Farmers such as Yugal Kishore Singh of Champapur Gonauli village under Valmikinagar police station, Mani Bhusan Pandey of Serwa-Barawal under Bagaha police station and Banarsi Sao of Paroraha village under Laukaria police station are among several other farmers who said how over a year ago some employees of the sugar factory management collected signatures or thumb impressions on papers bearing content in English. The companys officials also collected photographs of the sugarcane growers and photocopies of their photo identity cards on the pretext of giving them smart cards, which the farmers could use to get seeds and fertiliser on the factorys credit. The cash-strapped sugarcane growers readily accepted the companys proposal, without realising that it was a fraudulent deal, Yugal said.We realised that we were cheated only when we received orders from the bank, asking us to repay KCC loan amounts, he added. Sugarcane department and minor irrigation minister Awadhesh Prasad Kushwaha told The Telegraph: We have received complaints from several farmers on alleged irregularities in distribution of seeds and KCC loan amounts. A thorough and impartial inquiry has already been ordered. According to the sugarcane growers, huge portions of the KCC loans for farmers were allegedly withdrawn by the sugar factory management and utilised (by the factory) to purchase landed property. This amounts to cheating the sugarcane growers and the government as well, a farmer said. Chief general manager of the company, C.P. Upadhyaya, said, Some people with vested interests are conspiring against the factory. Besides, some workers, who were sacked because of their non-performance, are trying to blackmail the company by raising such baseless charges. According to the lists of beneficiaries submitted by the Tirupati Sugars Limited to the office of the assistant director (sugarcane industry), the factory claimed to have distributed seeds of moong, urad, lentil, coriander and potato free of cost among a select 1,355 sugarcane growers for the promotion of subsidiary crop. Prem Lal Singh, the assistant director of sugarcane industry whose office is on the premises of Tirupati Sugar Ltd factory, told The Telegraph: I have joined office in July, but have heard from several farmers that they did not receive seeds from the sugar factory management. Tej Pratap Singh, a member of the zonal development council (sugarcane) Ramnagar, said: The sugar factory owes about Rs 40 crore to the farmers. Instead of paying them, the officials duped the farmers and the government as well. Deputy director (sugarcane) Shailendra Kumar, who is based in Motihari, said, We have sought the certification and physical financial reports from the assistant director. There should be a thorough inquiry into the entire episode. But the farmers are not willing to wait longer for justice. The chief minister is set to embark on his Sewa Yatra from Valmikinagar on November 9. We want that the probe to get over by then. Or else the sugarcane growers will intensify their protests, said Yugal."

This coupled with natural calamities, uncertain weather conditions, increasing transportation and labour cost have ensured that vegetable prices would never be dirt cheap again as they used to be till a few years ago.Adding to the burden, the arrival of green vegetables have come down drastically. This has forced the denizens with no other option but to surrender abjectly to the price rise silently. ""I am afraid of going to the market to buy vegetables these days. Nothing is available below Rs 40 a kg. You will feel like it would be better to starve to death than buy vegetables at such a high price,"" said Krushna Chandra Mohanty, a customer.Unit-I market, which was popular for ""reasonable"" prices, is also going out of bounds for the common man. The prices are going through the roof for inexplicable reasons in the last few weeks. Being the holy month of Kartik during which most Oriya families shun non-vegetarian food, the soaring vegetable prices has brought tears in the eyes of general public.""The price of vegetables has queered the family budget. The potato, however, is a saving grace this season. I am cooking potatoes continuously for the last few days as I have no option left,"" said Sabita Swain, a housewife.Sanjay Prusty, a vegetable vendor at Unit-I market, said, ""There is no local vegetable available in the market. Whatever we are selling are either imported from other states or supplied from of far off districts such as Bargarh, Sambalpur and Mayurbhanj. As we are buying the vegetables at a higher price, how can we sale it at lower price.""According to market sources, the city used to receive green vegetables of about 4000 quintals every day, which has come down to around 2500 to 3000 quintals after the devastating floods of last month.""Of the total consumption of the city a large volume was supplied from nearby villages in and around Bhuabneswar and Cuttack. But in the last few years most of the farm lands have been occupied by builders and concrete jungles have come up in large scale drastically reducing the vegetable production. Moreover the cost of labour has increased so much as a result not many farmers are keen for agriculture,"" said Gaydhar Swain, secretary of Rajdhani Haat Byabasayee Sangha.The vendors also alleged that though it was very difficult to regulate the prices of green vegetables as it is a highly perishable item, the Regulating Marketing Committee in the city is near defunct and plays no role at all in price regulation. ""People are also not reacting to the price rise. They should impose pressure on the government agencies to regulate prices,"" said Dusmanta Panda, a resident of Ashok Nagar. Due to public pressure in small towns the regulating marketing committee could successfully impose a fixed price on some items then why not in Bhubaneswar, he added.""We can regulate the prices of dry items like onion, potato, ginger and garlic and even non-veg items to some extent but fixing price of green vegetables is not possible. It depends on a number of factors, which are beyond the control of the government,"" said S K Mishra, a senior officer in food and supply department.Not just the exotic beans and capsicum but the relatively affordable tomato, pumpkin, brinjal- basic ingredients in most Oriya dishes are no more within the reach of a majority of people.A bundle of coriander which was selling at Rs 6 to Rs 8 is now Rs 20.

	Chennaiites turn to biodegradable plastic bags after apex court ban 

	 ",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/-Chennaiites-turn-to-biodegradable-plastic-bags-after-apex-court-ban/articleshow/10539971.cms,2011-10-30,The Times Of India,"CHENNAI: In the wake of the Supreme Court ban on plastic bags less than 40 microns thick and retailers charging for plastic bags, biodegradable and compostable plastic bags may soon become an alternative to both plastic and paper bags. With increased awareness, says manufacturers and distributors, the demand for such bags is increasing.Biodegradable and compostable bags are made from renewable resin obtained from potato or soyabean and take around 90 days to degrade in the soil. ""The bags are made with pure resin and don't contain any heavy metals. The bacteria in the soil will be able to eat the plastic bags,"" said Y Goutham, consultant for Ecolife that has been distributing these eco-friendly bags to hotels, organic grain manufacturers and for packaging in the city for the last three years. ""Awareness was very low when we started and there were hardly any takers in the first year. Now with increased awareness and the ban on plastics, we are getting a good number of enquiries,"" he said.According to ISO 17088:2008 standards that specify procedures and requirements for biodegradable and compostable plastics, over 90% of the organic carbon in plastic should be converted to carbon dioxide within 180 days and the plastic should degrade completely without leaving any residuals in the compost.While normal plastic bags can stay around landfills for years and are associated with risks such as jamming of water bodies and ingestion by animals, paper bags also cause a lot of pollution and use up a lot of energy during manufacture and recycling. ""These biodegradable bags may not be completely energy-efficient but they have a significantly small carbon footprint as most of the carbon is given back to the environment by aerobic decomposition,"" says Balakrishnan.Manufacturers say compostable plastic bags are as strong and durable as a normal plastic bag. However, prices are steeper with a compostable plastic bag costing anywhere between 2 and 5 times a normal plastic bag.""All new technologies are expensive. However, large scale production of these plastics is possible using the same infrastructure as for normal plastics and prices will fall once large capacities have been built up,"" says Sunder Balakrishnan, general manager and head of Naturetech, a brand of compostable plastic products including bags, cutlery and paper cups."

They cost 29 a kg at the Koyambedu wholesale market, up from 20 per kg last month. Drumstick prices have gone up from 30 to 35 per kg. Tomatoes, priced at 15 per kg in Koyambedu cost, double that in retail stores. The prices are lower than what they were in last October, when beans sold for 50 for a kg and drumsticks were priced at 120 per kg.Wholesale vegetable dealers said prices of other vegetables have remained stable over the last three months. V R Soundarajan, market advisor to the wholesaler's association in Koyambedu said prices of potato and onion have remained stable at 15 per kg and 10 per kg since May. ""There has been a hike in the price of beans, drumstick and flat beans over the last month. Compared to last year, price of tomatoes is 5 more than what it was in last October,"" he said.While carrots were sold at 40-45 per kg last year, this year, the prices haven't gone beyond 20-23 per kg. Sounderajan said the low prices of vegetables may be due to heavy rains in the districts of Tiruvannamalai, Theni and Madurai where vegetables are grown. This is not good for bean crop which are prone to fungal diseases during the wet season. M Selva Ganapathi, who runs Sri Karthikeyan Vegetables in Koyambedu said the number of customers at the market have reduced with the rains."

Hence,selling them at Rs 3 or even Rs 5 per kg was a direct loss to the farmers here.President of the Deesa Cold Storages Association Ganpat Kachhwaha,when contacted,said about a dozen cold storage owners and leading potato growers on Tuesday called on Principal Secretary(Agriculture) R K Tripathi,seeking his intervention.Kachhwaha said potato growers requested the government to give transport subsidy so that farmers could take their produce to the states like Tamil Nadu,Karnataka and Maharashtra where there was shortage of the commodity and fetch better prices.He said there was at least 89 lakh bags,each with 50 kg of potato,stored in the cold storages across the state. If these were not released and sold out by December,there was going to be potato glut in the state with the new crop arriving in February 2012. There would be no space in cold storages for storing the new crop. Moreover,the storage charges for the old crop would further go up and it would not be profitable because of the prices crashing due to new crop reaching the markets.Though Tripathi could not be contacted,states Agriculture Minister Dilip Sanghani said the state government could not stop farmers from other states from selling their produce in Gujarat.However,he said the state government could certainly consider other measures like subsidy on transporting the produce to other states. He said he had spoken to Tripathi to look into the issue and take a decision to help the farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Same is the case of vegetables. According to sellers, the sky-touching prices of these products is the main reason why the markets wear a deserted look.Prices of most products transported from other cities and states have almost doubled. Shopkeepers complain that the demand has come down considerably due to the high prices. Locally produced vegetables and fruits continue to be sold at the old prices and even the supply is not hit.Initially due to flood, and now with the festive season, the fruits and vegetables are proving to be out of reach for 'aam aadmi'. Nothing in the market remain affordable for the commoners, said Sandeep, a shopkeeper in a local mandi.The prices of vegetables are much more in comparison to the prices in the previous few months due to weather changes and floods in the region. Even potato is out the reach of common man, as it being sold at Rs15 per kg.Coriander and brinjal, the vegetables of present season, are beyond the reach of poor. Coriander is being sold at Rs 200 per kg and brinjal at Rs 25.Similar is the case of ladyfinger, cauliflower, tomato, onion and capsicum which are being sold in between Rs 35 and Rs 50 per kg.Meanwhile, buying flowers could actually leave one's wallet thinner. Varieties like rose, mora and marigold are being sold between Rs 200 and Rs 500 per kg. Almost Rs 50 more in every variety, what it was a week ago.Prices of exotic varieties like chrysanthemums, blue daisies, carnations etc have gone up by at least Rs 70 per kg. These flowers are mainly used for decorative purposes.""We hardly have any customers. Flowers are decaying on the stands. The prices have increased since 'Navratra' but I think people are not coming due further rise in prices,"" said Sunita, owner of flower stall. The price of roses is always high during any festival and the same is true for Diwali and 'Chhath puja'. The wholesale price of Rs 100 for 100 pieces may surge to Rs 250 in the next two days. ""During the festive seasons, the labour and transport charges are high and this leads to increase in prices,"" she added.However, the fruits are the worst hit. ""The supply is less. The prices of most fruits, including common ones like mosambi and banana, have gone up. There are very few customers. We are a worried lot,"" says Shivam, owner of a fruit stall. ""It's a miserable period for us,"" he added.""We use to prepare small baskets for 'Chhath' and 'Annakoot' rituals. The charges are high as most of the vegetables and fruits are very costly. So, we hardly buyers,"" said Ankur, a seller at Phoolbagh fruit 'Mandi'."
285,Water security is now a priority for global firms,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/water-security-is-now-a-priority-for-global-firms/article2592928.ece,2011-11-03,The Hindu,"From the cotton field in rural India to the local rag bin, a typical pair of blue jeans consumes 919 gallons of water during its life cycle, Levi Strauss & Company says, or enough to fill about 15 spa-size bathtubs. That includes the water that goes into irrigating the cotton crop, stitching the jeans together and washing them scores of times at home.The company wants to reduce that number any way it can, and not just to project environmental responsibility. It fears that water shortages caused by climate change may jeopardise the company's very existence in the coming decades by making cotton too expensive or scarce.So to protect its bottom line, Levi Strauss has helped underwrite and champion a non-profit programme that teaches farmers in India, Pakistan, Brazil and West and Central Africa the latest irrigation and rainwater-capture techniques. It has introduced a brand featuring stone-washed denim smoothed with rocks but no water. It is sewing tags into all of its jeans urging customers to wash less and use only cold water.To customers seeking further advice, Levi Strauss suggests washing jeans rarely, if at all  the theory being that putting them in the freezer will kill germs that cause them to smell.Carbon disclosure projectConservation worries are not limited to the clothing giants: food and beverage conglomerates, tobacco companies and metal and mining companies are all starting to reckon with their heavy dependence on water. Pepsico, for example, has embraced a method of sanitising plastic bottles with purified air instead of water at a plant in Georgia. For its Frito-Lay brands, it has identified drought-resistant potato strains that it provides to farmers along with a soil-monitoring method so that crops are watered only when necessary.The Carbon Disclosure Project, a group that monitors corporations' greenhouse gas emissions, recently added water security to its priorities. Of the 150 companies that responded last year to a questionnaire that it sent to the world's largest corporations, nearly 40 per cent reported that water problems had already resulted in detrimental impacts to their businesses.The threat of water shortages was brought home to Levi Strauss last year when floods in Pakistan and parched fields in China destroyed cotton crops and sent prices soaring. Roughly two pounds of cotton go into every pair of jeans that the company manufactures. Although scientists are wary of linking specific extreme weather events to climate change, recent increases in floods and droughts are in line with patterns that experts have long projected would result from global warming. The general rule of thumb is that wet regions will get wetter and dry regions will become even more arid.Upmanu Lall, director of the Columbia Water Center at Columbia University's Earth Institute, said that the local implications of those changes were still being sorted out but that agriculture, which does best with a relatively consistent supply of water, will be impacted the most.That is particularly the case for cotton, the world's biggest nonfood crop. Many big cotton-producing countries like India, which has tens of thousands of small cotton farmers, lack the reservoirs to store water, heightening the risk of shortages.Companies doing business overseas are also contending with rising water costs or water that is not clean enough. Then there is the threat of bad publicity if a corporation is perceived to be squandering precious local water. The total volume of water used by a single beverage business, for example, may not be much, Dr. Lall said. But they are often the most visible users in a locality, depleting groundwater much more quickly than, say, a small farmer.It is not lost on American and European manufacturers that cotton already competes with grain for what arable land exists in some regions, a tension that will only grow as the world seeks to feed its growing population in coming decades.Making better cotton'Because cotton is mostly grown by a diffuse network of very small farmers in more than 70 countries, encouraging water-efficient practices is a formidable challenge. Cotton cultivation accounts for more than three per cent of the world's agricultural water use and six per cent of all pesticide purchases. Outmoded practices like field flooding contribute to overconsumption.In 2005, nongovernmental and cotton industry organisations and some giant retailers, including Ikea, the Gap and Adidas, founded the international non-profit Better Cotton Initiative to promote water conservation and reduce pesticide use and child-labour practices in the industry. Levi Strauss joined in 2009. Partners include groups like Cotton Inc., an American industry association that has provided technical know-how. A three-year independent study of Indian farms found those adopting the new techniques reduced water and pesticide use by an average of 32 per cent, the initiative says. The profit was 20 per cent higher than that of a control group using traditional methods. The resulting crop from the new methods of farming is now referred to by Levi Strauss and the initiative as better cotton. Levi Strauss's top management says that about five per cent of the cotton used in the two million pairs of jeans the company shipped to stores this fall was grown with the sustainable method. The company wants that number to rise to 20 per cent by 2015.Ikea, the furniture chain, hopes to be using better cotton exclusively by 2015. The footwear maker Adidas has said it will do the same by 2018.To reach its 20 per cent goal, Levi Strauss says it must radically change how it does business, engaging more directly with contractors as well as farmers. There was a time when American corporations preferred not to know what was going on in foreign factories  to afford them maximum deniability in the event that poor labour or environmental practices were discovered.Levi Strauss, which reported $4.4 billion in net revenue last year, would not reveal how much it is spending on water sustainability efforts, beyond saying that the company and its foundation have given a combined $600,000 to the Better Cotton Initiative since 2009.Selling an ideaOn a recent morning at Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco, company executives were trying to figure out how best to capitalise on their water conservation efforts. After being briefed on the cotton initiative by the sustainability team, the new chief marketing officer, Rebecca Van Dyck nodded her approval, then asked, But do our customers know?Customers shopping at the Levi's store in Times Square one recent afternoon said they had never heard of the company's WaterLess brand or other conservation efforts.

Photo: N. BashkaranFrom just Rs. 3 a kg in July, tomato prices have sky-rocketed to Rs. 25 a kg on Wednesday and later cooled off to Rs. 18 a kg on Thursday in wholesale markets in Krishnagiri district. Traders expect the price to touch Rs. 40 a kg by Pongal (January).B. Doorvasar, secretary, Tomato Market Association, Royakottai, told The Hindu on Thursday that the prices touched Rs. 690 a grade of 25 kg (Rs. 28 a kg) in the market on Wednesday. Then it came down to Rs. 300 to Rs. 430 a grade (Rs. 18 a kg) on Thursday.He said the fluctuation in prices would continue till Pongal festival.During the same time last year, the price of a grade of tomato were hovering around Rs. 1,000 (Rs. 40 a kg).The price of tomato had touched an all time low of Rs. 3 to Rs. 4 a kg during July this year in the wholesale markets in Hosur, Royakottai, Krishnagiri and Shoolagiri in Krishnagiri district.Tomato, cabbage, and potatoes produced in Hosur, a prime agriculture belt in the State, enjoy a premium price in all markets.Tomato is is cultivated in more than 3,000 hectares in and around Hosur, Denkanikottai, Anchetti and Royakottai with an annual production of over 50,000 tonnes.These tomatoes are transported to wholesale markets at Rayakottai, Krishnagiri, Shoolagiri and Hosur in the district and sold to consumers in Palani, Dindigul, Trichy, Chennai, Bangalore, and other cities.Mr. Doorvasar, said that the varieties such as Red Ruby, Surabi, 618, 1196 and Bramma were cultivated in large quantities in this region.The crop cultivated in upper land were affected by rain.Over 50 per cent of tomatoes have gone rotten.Now, the market gets only 250 to 500 grades instead of the 3,000 to 4,000 grades they used to get daily from January to September.Daily around 80 tonnes to 90 tonnes of tomatoes are being sent to the wholesale vegetable market in Koyambedu in Chennai."
287,"Petrol price hike: Allies fume, Manmohan Singh unmoved",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Petrol-price-hike-Allies-fume-Manmohan-Singh-unmoved/articleshow/10612527.cms,2011-11-05,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Pressure mounted on the government to at least partially roll back the increase in petrol prices on Friday as ruling coalition partners slammed the hike and even Congress urged the Centre to consider a ""healing touch"" to public discontent.""Enough is enough,"" said an angry West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee as she reminded Congress that UPA government's survival depended on the support of Trinamool and other allies and her MPs had ""unanimously decided to withdraw from the ruling coalition"".Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seemed unmoved by the rising clamour against the fuel hike. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the G-20 deliberations in Cannes, he said, ""We must move in the direction of decontrolling more prices. I have no hesitation in saying markets must find their own levels.""But popular anger, demands by allies and opposition attacks might pitch a relook at fuel prices to the top of the PM's to-do list when he comes back, with the winter session of Parliament three weeks away and Congress facing the charge of being insensitive to the privation caused by high food and fuel prices.Adding to the government's woes is the re-emergence of Gandhian transparency campaigner Anna Hazare who promptly expanded his anti-graft agenda to include price rise, saying that corruption was contributing to inflation. Denouncing the hike, Hazare said, ""How does the government think people can survive. The oil companies and the government are in league.""Even the judiciary weighed in, with Kerala High Court empathizing with people's anger against price rise and directing the oil companies, including the private sector Reliance to show it their balance sheets.Trinamool Congress was the most demonstrative with party MPs unanimously ""deciding"" to pull out of the UPA to protest against Friday's hike. Although party chief Mamata Banerjee put the decision on hold till she held talks with the PM on his return from Cannes, she praised her MPs for their decision. ""They are in favour of pulling out of the government. I am proud of their decision, Somebody has to bell the cat, and I am glad they took the decision. But it is essential to hold a discussion before taking a conclusive step,"" she said.Banerjee also reminded that Trinamool, along with other UPA partners, held the key to the coalition's survival. ""Congress is a big party, ours is small. But the government in Delhi is running with support from smaller partners namely DMK, NCP and Trinamool Congress. In this state, we (Trinamool) have two-thirds majority and still we are in the government (with the Congress). There are strong compulsions in alliance politics,"" the CM said.Distancing herself from the unpopular decision by saying that her representative in the Cabinet, railway minister Dinesh Trivedi, was overruled, she said, ""Fuel prices were hiked 11 times in the past 12 months. Enough is enough. We can't be patient any more. We are being told that diesel prices and those of cooking gas are also going to increase.""Banerjee said she was not holding a gun to the Centre, but clearly felt the need to forcefully articulate the hardship caused by frequent fuel price hikes.Other UPA partners were also critical of the hike, although they did not threaten to pull out. National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah said inflation could be discussed in the next Cabinet meeting, NCP spokesperson Tariq Anwar opposed frequent price hikes. DMK's T R Baalu said there was no rationale for the increase.Government sources pointed to a ""difficult"" situation as oil bills were mounting with the rupee falling against the dollar and the Centre not touching subsidies on cooking gas, kerosene and diesel. ""Cooking gas is just as much an emotive issue for the middle classes,"" said sources.None of the allies are engaging in brinksmanship by pulling out of the government or offering ""outside support"" - a favourite bargaining ploy - but feel strongly about softening the blow. Congress sources also feel that a part rollback is on the cards in view of political realities ,with the Centre already under fire for price rise.With opposition mocking Congress's ""aam aadmi"" sloganeering, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the party was ""very concerned about price rise and hopes the government will look into the matter very seriously and do everything in its power to diminish this increase"".Interestingly, oil companies while ruling out a rollback, tossed the hot potato back into the government's court by saying they could cut rates if the government issued a directive. While fuel prices are supposedly deregulated, a nod from the government is essential before a hike.Congress sources felt a ""partial rollback"" could happen in the next few days after the PM returned on Sunday. ""In the next Cabinet meeting, there will be a debate on it,"" Abdullah said. ""We are very much concerned. The government should devise some mechanism to check frequent hike in petrol prices,"" NCP general secretary Tariq Anwar said.Asked about Trinamool Congress' threat to pull out of government on the issue, Anwar was quick to add, ""We do not have any such plans."" Abdullah and Anwar pointed out that the government had not touched the prices of diesel and cooking gas which is used by the masses."

On one side of his 15-acre farm, which was used to compare methods, the cotton plants are about a foot taller and bear more flowers than the ones on the other side. The lusher field has a drip irrigation system  a tangle of plastic veins that direct water to each plants root system  that was installed with advice from the Better Cotton Initiative.Mahalle said the drip system spreads water and fertilizer more evenly than traditional pumping, and because it puts water only where it is needed, it also results in fewer weeds.Power failures, commonplace in India, are less worrisome now because drip irrigation does not require electricity over an extended period of time, as traditional irrigating methods do.This takes three hours; that takes three days, Mahalle said, and his water use is down by about 70 per cent.The resulting crop from the new methods of farming is now referred to by Levi Strauss and the initiative as better cotton.

Edmund X White, a Brooklyn photographer, even chronicled his efforts to avoid washing his jeans.Two months into his experiment, on his honeymoon in Jamaica, he wrote, he dived into the ocean with a pair on. Afterward, White boasted, 11 months passed without a wash.As long as you dont get dirt on them, dont do a lot of strenuous activity in them and - sorry if this is a bit vulgar - be sure to always wear underwear, you can really go a very long time between washing, he wrote."
289,"In season of high prices, farmer kills himself for fear of poor returns",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1111108/jsp/bengal/story_14721707.jsp,2011-11-08,Telegraph,"In season of high prices, farmer kills himself for fear of poor returnsBurdwan, Nov. 7: A debt-ridden farmer killed himself in Burdwan last evening after complaining of poor prices for his produce  a seemingly incongruous reality in the middle of a countrywide uproar over rising prices. Madhab Ghosh, 62, perhaps the first farmer whose suicide has been reported since the Mamata Banerjee government took over in May, drank pesticide around 6pm at his home at Jatka village in Raina, Burdwan. Madhab cultivated seven bighas or over 2 acres, an average holding but not small enough to drive him to suicide. However, he found accumulated debts of Rs 70,000 too crushing to bear, possibly because the prices he was being offered for the produce  rice and potatoes  were not enough to sustain his family and repay his dues. If middlemen were standing between Madhab and the market where prices are skyrocketing, he got caught in a pincer attack from the other flank where fertiliser black marketeers were seeking their pound of flesh. Earlier in the day, Madhab had gone to buy fertiliser for his next potato crop after harvesting rice, his nephew Hiranmoy said. While having lunch, he told his wife, this time the black market rates of fertilisers will not let me cultivate potatoes. I already have 300 sacks of potatoes from last year in the cold storage which I have not sold because the price is too low, said Hiranmoy. He (Madhab) also told his wife that he feared he would not get the official price of Rs 1,080 per quintal for the 75 bags of rice (about 45 quintals) he wished to sell. He also had fears that the fertiliser he would require for the forthcoming aus (winter) crop will cost a minimum of Rs 1,500. He didnt have that kind of money. My uncle had Rs 70,000 in debt for he had borrowed from moneylenders to cultivate his land, said Hiranmoy. After Madhab went into a room, wife Minoti and son Manoj heard the sound of vomiting. They opened the door and saw Madhab lying on the ground, foaming at the mouth. A pesticide bottle lay near him. District food and supplies controller Raju Mukherjee said rice mill owners were supposed to pay farmers Rs 1,080 per quintal. But another district official said many of the around 400 rice mills in Burdwan bought rice from middlemen. Banamali Ghosh, a farmer of Hijalna village, 2km from Jakta, echoed the official. We sell rice to middlemen since they buy directly from our doorstep. It saves us a lot of trouble. We know that we are getting less, she said. Food and supplies minister Jyotipriya Mullick said his department would ensure that middlemen did not come between farmers and mills."
290,Banks should lead the war on poverty,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/banks-should-lead-the-war-on-poverty/article2613213.ece,2011-11-10,The Hindu,"At BANCON (annual bankers' conference) 2011 in Chennai, financial institutions explored avenues for greater participation in agriculture and rural development. There are a few areas in need of additional attention and investment.Green Revolution technologies are scale-neutral but not resource-neutral. Inputs are needed for output; therefore market-purchased inputs become important in providing soil and plant healthcare for higher yields. Social scientists point out that small and marginal farmers will be excluded from the benefits of the Green Revolution since they would not have the financial resource to buy inputs. The Government of India initiated a Small and Marginal Farmers Programme specially to provide credit and other inputs. After bank nationalisation, provision of credit to small and marginal farmers got priority. Without this, the wheat revolution would not have covered all farmers. The smaller the farm, the greater is the need for marketable surplus, so that the family will have cash income to meet their needs.The emerging phase in agriculture will be based on integrating the principles of ecology and equity in technology development and dissemination. This is the path to an ever-green revolution leading to sustained increase in productivity without associated environmental harm. In recent years, the government has stepped up credit for agriculture. However, the burden of indebtedness is still high in rural India, and the rural masses are exploited in the credit market. Much of the credit intended for farmers goes through indirect channels, and not directly to them.Problems in the supply of credit to rural families include inadequate supply of formal credit on the whole, imperfect and fragmented rural credit markets, and unequal distribution of credit, particularly with respect to region, class, caste and gender. In spite of the dominant role played by women in both farming, they are denied credit as they lack land titles. Only a small percentage of Kisan Credit Cards goes to them. Consequently, the major source of credit to rural households, particularly income-poor working households, continues to be the informal sector. Many of the farmer suicides, particularly in the drought-prone areas, are attributed to lack of access to formal credit at reasonable interest rates.If farmers have to take their lives, then there is something wrong in our economic and social structure. Unfortunately, this issue is being dealt with in statistical terms and not from the point of view of the real state of farming.Financial inclusionApart from the initiatives taken by banks, some of which are commendable, the most important instrument to reach the unreached in terms of access to credit is microcredit. A number of non-banking finance companies have entered the rural microcredit market. Many microcredit agencies have been charging interest rates not very dissimilar to those charged by moneylenders. Borrowing then becomes more to meet pressing consumption needs, rather than for farming or small-scale enterprises. There are examples of micro-enterprises organised by women's Self-Help Groups with the help of microcredit. Production-oriented SHGs become sustainable if they have backward linkages with technology and credit and forward linkages with the market. The rationale for microcredit is to strengthen the livelihood security of the economically underprivileged sections, and its impact should be measured in terms of reduction achieved in poverty and hunger. Formal financial institutions should provide funds to non-banking finance companies only on the basis of a well-defined code of conduct that will help promote a win-win situation for the lending institution and the SHGs operating market-driven micro-enterprises.The pervasive nature of malnutrition in India is evident from national and international surveys. International price volatility is high, both due to a continuous rise in petroleum prices, and unfavourable weather conditions. For the poor, including small and marginal farmers, food inflation increases their vulnerability to hunger. India's food inflation is now over 12 per cent. The Reserve Bank of India has raised interest rates 13 times in 19 months. They are up from 4.75 per cent in March 2010 to 8.5 per cent in October 2011. The inflation rate has been steady since March 2010, despite RBI interventions. A fresh approach is needed, going beyond merely altering interest rates to contain inflation. In measures to contain food inflation, a disaggregated approach is needed. Look at a few commodities: Vegetables : Prices have gone up by 63.95 per cent in the last six months. The National Horticulture Mission with an outlay of about Rs. 20,000 crore, meant to increase production of vegetables and fruits, puts emphasis on commercial vegetables, including for export, rather than on malnutrition. For every nutritional malady there is a horticultural remedy. The nutrition and food inflation containment dimensions in the Horticulture Mission should be mainstreamed. Mapping the hot-spots with reference to the gap between demand and supply and planning the production and distribution strategy will help check inflation. Pulses : Budget 2011 provided funds to establish 60,000 Pulses Villages. If the programme is implemented holistically, price rise can be halted. Banks can help establish Pulses Seed Villages to provide seeds, as Indian Overseas Bank did over 10 years ago in Tamil Nadu. Potato and onion : In a report on managing the prices of perishable commodities submitted to Indira Gandhi in 1982, a detailed strategy for the management of output and prices in the case of crops such as onion and potato was dealt with. The approach suggested was similar to what was done in the case of milk by Dr. V. Kurien and the National Diary Development Board, where the emphasis was on post-harvest infrastructure and management. Unfortunately, the National Horticulture Board has not been able to play a similar role. It is time we developed a mechanism that can ensure remunerative prices. Milk : Nearly 80 per cent of the price of milk is accounted for by the cost of feed and fodder. We are exporting concentrates like the soyabean meal while we have nearly one billion farm animals to feed. Often, common grazing grounds are diverted for other uses. Seeds of good fodder varieties are not available. In areas where there are large numbers of dairy cattle, SHGs can organise fodder and feed banks with support from banks. Rice, wheat and nutri-cereals : Prices of these staples have remained relatively stable largely because of procurement and public distribution policies. This has a lesson for other crops: food inflation can be contained if a disaggregated commodity-centred approach based on a clear understanding of the causes for price rise is adopted.Over 60 per cent of India's population is engaged in agriculture. Our greatest challenge is the technological upgradation of small-farm operations to improve small-farm productivity, profitability and sustainability. There is a growing gap between scientific know-how and field-level do-how. Indian Overseas Bank is helping to organise Farm Schools in the fields of outstanding farm women and men to bring those from other areas to stay for a few days with the farmer-achievers, helping multiply successes. Members of the banking family could take up such activities under their corporate social responsibility programme.There is a need for greater credit and insurance literacy among farm families. Financial institutions interested in increasing their lending for food security could locate a staff member in Krishi Vigyan Kendras. I initiated the KVK pathway of knowledge and skill empowerment in 1974 with the first one located at Puducherry. Now there are over 500 KVKs operated by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, agricultural universities and non-government institutions that can provide locations for financial institutions to launch a credit and insurance literacy movement.If agriculture goes wrong, nothing else will have a chance to go right in India. With a National Food Security Bill on the anvil, we must redouble our efforts to increase farm production on an environmentally sustainable basis. The banking community played an important part in enabling the Green Revolution. It should now play such a role in ushering in the era of freedom from hunger.(Professor M.S. Swaminathan is a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha, and the Chairman of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai.)The banking community played an important part in enabling the Green Revolution. It should play such a role in ushering in the era of freedom from hunger."
291,Letters to the editor,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article2616723.ece,2011-11-11,The Hindu,"HistoricThe special court verdict sentencing 31 persons to life imprisonment for the Sardarpura massacre in 2002 has done some justice to the Gujarat riot victims. This is the first time that so many accused have been convicted for mob violence. It offers the hope that justice will be done in other instances of communal massacre too. But justice will be truly and fully done only when those who hatched the larger conspiracy  and spurred the smaller fry like those sentenced in the Sardarpura case to indulge in rioting  are punished. Those who misuse religion for political ends should also be made responsible for their actions.G. David Milton,MaruthancodeThe Sardarpura riot verdict is indeed the first whiff of justice for the Gujarat riot victims. That, for the first time, the largest number of persons have been convicted for mob violence in one go sends the message that a mob cannot hope to get away under cover of anonymity. The police have done well to persist with the case and obtain the convictions.R. Narayanan,GhaziabadThe verdict has provided a semblance of relief to the survivors and relatives of the victims, and a victory for the Special Investigating Team constituted by the Supreme Court. An appeal by both parties  police and those sentenced  is on the cards. The judiciary has created history and accomplished a magnificent task.Capt. T. Raju (retd.),SecunderabadIt is indeed a watershed moment in the history of Indian democracy. Even though justice came late, the court's decision to award life imprisonment to 31 persons is a step in the right direction. Once again, the judiciary has proved that it is a beacon of hope for the poor.Vijayalakshmi Swaminathan,ChennaiWar on povertyThe article Banks should lead the war on poverty (Nov. 10) by eminent agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan was comprehensive. The increase in the number of suicides among farmers is an issue of grave concern. If farmers continue to take their lives and if the trend of giving up farm work continues, where will our huge population go for food? Farmers are unfortunate because they have no attractive future. Their dependence on pesticides and fertilizers has added to their indebtedness. For development and growth, we have to empower farmers and, as pointed out by Prof. Swaminathan, banks should play an important role towards achieving the end.Parveen Kaswan,NoidaProf. Swaminathan made worthwhile suggestions even while he was the Director-General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and the Agriculture Secretary, Government of India. But the factors that came in the way of implementing them then and hinder their implementation now are more or less the same at the field level. It was the lack of sufficient credit availability at reasonable interest rates and timely availability of the same from moneylenders then and banks now. The high risk involved in the recovery of loans extended to farmers due to uncertainty in agriculture operations is the root cause of high interest.Neither appeals for corporate social responsibility nor a literacy movement to educate farmers will bring about any substantial attitudinal change among affluent corporates or orthodox farmers. While the corporates are concerned more with profits, the farmers are worried about the high cost of cultivation and cost of living. Unless structural and revolutionary changes are thought of with regard to agriculture holdings which are highly fragmented and corporatised for better bargaining power with the lending agencies, the betterment of farmers will remain an utopia.K.M. Lakshmana Rao,VisakhapatnamProf. Swaminathan is right in saying that but for the nationalisation of banks, the wheat revolution would not have covered all farmers. It was the aggressive lending by public sector banks that changed the rural scenario.Rural branches of nationalised banks have become part of social life in villages. As one who has been directly involved in agricultural financing through banks for long, I can say that banks benefited from agriculture finance. But with economic liberalisation, income recognition has become an important factor. The NPA aspect haunts banks. The entry of private banks also poses problems. The government should strengthen the cooperative sector by releasing it from the clutches of politics.Karavadi Raghava Rao,VijayawadaThe State governments should distribute vegetables through farmers' markets in towns and cities. Pulse seed villages can be supervised by banks in coordination with the State agricultural universities or Central research institutes like ICRISAT. For perishable commodities like potato and onion, banks can finance post-harvest infrastructure units like cold storage warehouses.Each member of the banking family under the corporate social responsibility programme can establish its own agricultural foundation (on the lines of Syndicate Bank's Agricultural Foundation established about 50 years ago) to reach villages through extension activities.M.K. Kopalle,SecunderabadDeoband fatwaThe Darul Uloom Deoband's fatwa against celebrating birthdays, saying it is a western practice and has no sanction in Islam, shows the extent of Wahabi influence on Deobandis. Their claim about the Prophet's birthday is misleading. Once, the Prophet himself made a mention of his birthday to his companions. Absurd fatwas are detrimental to the growth of Muslims. Many Indian and non-Indian scholars have issued fatwas legalising the celebration of the Prophet's birth anniversary.Shahid Jamal,New DelhiDeoband is not the voice of a majority of Indian Muslims. By issuing a fatwa against the celebration of the birth of Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH), it has proved that it imposes the Wahabi ideology, which has been rejected by almost all Muslims across the world. Its fatwas have a very limited significance in the country. The celebration of Eid Milad Un Nabi (PBUH) is not only a praiseworthy event. Muslims consider the birth of the Holy Prophet the greatest event in history for which they are thankful to Allah, the creator. Deoband scholars are regular speakers in the Sir Syed Day celebrations and the Eid Milad Un Nabi celebrations at Aligarh Muslim University. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind regularly leads Milad Un Nabi processions at Kanpur.Syed Muhammad Qaudri,New DelhiKudankulam agitationThe Kudankulam agitation is the culmination of frustration among those who have not reaped the benefit of development. It is time the government resorted to an open dialogue, and spelt out measures for the benefit of the displaced and, most important, assured the villagers of basic amenities.S. Ganesan,GuduvancherryThe government has spent crores on the Kudankulam nuclear power plant. It cannot abandon it now. It must build a rapport with the people of the villages and educate them on the positive outcomes of the project.V. Sowmya,CoimbatoreJackson deathThe news that Michael Jackson's death was caused by gross negligence and violation of standard of care is sad. His personal physician, Dr. Cornad Murray, was certainly irresponsible even though he charged the singer $150,000 a month.K.M. Abdul Salim,EdavanakadDr. Conrad Murray has been sent to jail for prescribing an overdose of propofol, an anaesthetic and analgesic, which proved lethal for the singer. Does anybody in India ever think that prescribing an overdose is criminal negligence? There is hardly any control over the drugs used by doctors in India. Many freely prescribe a variety of drugs, often going beyond the maximum dose recommended by the drug manufacturer. Medical stores in India do not have qualified pharmacists to evaluate the prescriptions. In Indian hospitals, pharmacists, nurses and even the junior doctors do not question the excessive dose prescribed by senior physicians.Dr. Kunal Saha,Columbus"

BJP national vice-president Kalarj Mishra on Saturday said that faulty policies of the Centre and the Mayawati government in UP were responsible for fertiliser crisis in the state.Addressing people in Mainpuri, during his Jan Swabhiman Yatra, on Saturday, Mishra said that the price of common fertiliser has increased from Rs 542 per sack to 605 per sack and price of di-ammonium phosphate has increased from Rs 960 to Rs 1,200. However, both are not available to farmers due to short supply and black-marketing.""National Cooperative Union of India has admitted that the fertiliser priced at Rs 550 was being sold between Rs1,200 to Rs1,500. Last year the Centre deregulated all fertilisers except urea from the government control and as a result, prices have sky rocketed,"" Mishra said. Farm cooperatives are lying defunct due to apathy of the state government.Mishra said paddy growers were facing problems due to the wrong policies of both the governments. Around 5.5 lakh tonne paddy is available in the market and the Mayawati government has been able to purchase only 70,000 tonnes as against the procurement target of 25 lakh tonne, he said. On sugarcane state advised price (SAP), Mishra said farmers should be given Rs 300 per quintal for cane, whereas state government has fixed Rs 250 per quintal rate. Sugar mills have decided to challenge SAP in court taking plea that they cannot pay more than Rs 200 per quintal. Centre and state are not doing anything to help mills and farmers. In fact, he said, sugar prices can go up from existing Rs 28-30 per kg to Rs 35-40 per kg due to inaction of Centre and state governments.Mishra alleged rampant corruption in implementation of MNREGS in UP. He said that the potato growing belt of Etawah, Mainpuri, Agra and Farrukhabad does not have adequate facility for storing a perishable crop like potato. As a result, potato is rotting. He assured that if voted to power, BJP will construct cold storage for potato, establish agri-based industries in potato belt and encourage export of potato and potato products."

Banners hung across mill gates announce the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy - Rs 1,080 a quintal, Rs 648 for the 60kg sack of ordinary grade, and Rs 1,110 a quintal for the fine variety - flutter in the winter wind. The weary farmers don't even glance at them as they trudge home. They know the MSP is useless.Most of the mills - Uddin Rice Mill, Gobindobhog Rice Mill and others - are closed. Even licensed paddy agents have disappeared. The situation is desperate. The aman (winter) paddy is selling at Rs 415 for the 60kg sack in the open market, much below the government MSP. Yet the price of rice in Kolkata remains the same.The farmers have nowhere to go. Bales of paddy are being stacked higher in huts in Kultikuri village. It's a grim reminder every morning that the day's work is going to be futile and the coming year even more dreadful. It is this despair that forced farmer Safar Mollah to drink a bottle of pesticide last week, sending shockwaves in the village.It was the seventh farmer suicide this year and the 11th since August 2010. The state government has barely taken note of the deaths. Food minister Jyotipriya Mullick rubbed salt into the wound by saying that Safar died because he was drunk.The fact is that Mollah couldn't reap his harvest because he didn't have the money to hire labourers. Whatever money he had was not enough to pay the dues of the submersible pumps he took on hire or repay the loan taken from a local money lender during the last boro crop.Rural Bengal is teetering on a knife's edge, and it's not long before Kolkata starts feeling the aftershocks.Falling paddy prices have broken the normal crop cycle - reap the aman crop, invest the money in potato farming and use the money from potato crop to boro (summer) paddy. Everywhere you see there are drooping shoulders, tears in the eyes. Sheikh Abu Ahmad has had to put off his daughter's marriage and he is not the only one. ""What can I do? I have mortgaged everything I had to a money lender and borrowed Rs 16,000 on 10% interest. I cannot repay the loan. Mills have been closed for the last seven days. How many times should I go to the mill with my produce? It costs Rs 250 per trip,"" Ahmad said.The anger is spreading like wildfire, cutting across party lines. The food minister's insensitive statement triggered a strong retort from local Trinamool leader Sheikh Nurul Islam, Safar's neighbour and member of the Nityanandapur gram panchayat. ""The minister has to apologise or I will take it up with the human rights commission. How could he say such a thing? Safar was a devout Muslim. He never took alcohol. Some labourers told me that he was depressed because of his plight. The last time, paddy sold for Rs 620-650 a sack, but now it is Rs 415 though the cost of fertilizers has doubled. Isn't it strange that agro prices are falling when input costs are increasing?"" Nurul said.Getting down to the basics of aman cultivation, Nurul said: ""If you take all the input costs - seeds, fertiliser, pesticide, rent for tractors and submersible pumps, wages of labourers for sowing, weeding and harvesting, and then taking the harvest to home - we spend Rs 5,500 per bigha (one third of an acre). The yield is usually eight to 10 sacks of paddy (60 kg each), which means that the cost per sack is a minimum Rs 550,"" Nurul said.The MSP is Rs 640 a kg, Rs 90 higher than the cost price. ""That is true. But I have to carry the sacks to the mill or the government procurement camp, some 10-12 km from my village. The transport cost is a minimum Rs 200 to Rs 250. The farmer's cost thus comes to around Rs 750 a sack, higher than the MSP,"" Nurul said.Shiekh Manirul, a well-to-do farmer, has 1,000 sacks of last year's boro crop piled up at his home. ""This is apart from the aman crop spread over 50 bighas of my land. I have four submersible pumps. My annual electricity bill is Rs 25,000 and the pumps cost Rs 1.5 lakh a year. Now, I can't even hire labourers,"" Manirul said, the lines of worry deepening on his forehead.Trinamool MLA from Bhatar and chairman of the Assembly Standing Committee on Agriculture Banamali Hazra is also a victim of circumstances. ""I come from a peasant family and I have the same problem. Bales of paddy are piling up at my home. Although this is being managed by the food department, I will call on the food minister tomorrow,"" he said."
298,Food inflation drops to 9.01%,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/207016/food-inflation-drops-901.html,2011-11-24,Deccan Herald,"Food inflation drops to 9.01%Last updated: 24 November, 2011NEW DELHI, Nov 24, DHNS: 22:48 ISTPrices will moderate in coming weeks if trend continues: PranabAfter a gap of five weeks, food price index eased sharply to single digit at 9.01 per cent for the week ending November 12, bringing much waited relief to the government making strenuous efforts curb food inflation at 6 to 7 per cent by the end of this financial year.An elated Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said if the trend continued, there would be moderation in inflation in coming weeks.""If these trends continue for the next two weeks for the month of November, I hope there will be moderation in inflation and it will have an impact on the year-end inflationary figures,"" Mukherjee told reporters here. Food prices eased despite an upward spiral in the prices of most of the farm commodities, barring potatoes, onions and wheat.Food inflation, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index was 10.63 per cent in the previous week. It stood at 11.38 per cent in the corresponding week of the previous year. According to the data on food inflation, onions became cheaper by 32.85 per cent year-on-year, while potato prices were down by 7.23. Price of wheat also fell by 3.09 per cent.Normally, I do not have much confidence in the weekly figures. But if the trend continues, let us hope for the best, the Finance Minister said.Barring onions and potatoes, other vegetables became 17.66 per cent costlier.

301,State to go for bank loan to procure paddy,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/State-to-go-for-bank-loan-to-procure-paddy/articleshow/10925381.cms,2011-11-30,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: In order to do away with piled up stocks and earn some money, a large number of farmers are going for distress sale. As a result, they are not getting the right price for paddy. To prevent the situation from getting worse, the state government has decided to take a loan of Rs 400 crore from a nationalized bank, without waiting for funds to come in from the Centre.Once the funds come from Delhi, the loan amount would be replenished from it. The step was taken on Tuesday, state food and supplies minister Jyotipriya Mullick said.In addition, the state is also taking a loan of Rs 1,200 crore from Nabard at a low interest rate under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF), for improving infrastructure.The Centre provides Rs 2,000 crore for paddy procurement, but the money has not yet come and the state without waiting for it, has opted to go for the loan for paddy procurement. The decision was triggered by the misery of paddy farmers who are having a tough time trying to get the right price. In the recent past, burdened under heavy debts, several paddy farmers even committed suicide.The minimum support price being Rs 1,080 per quintal, the state has targetted procuring 20 lakh metric tonnes of paddy. The entire amount of paddy procured by the state government is offered by the Centre but it is yet to arrive. Any further delay could make things worse.Mullick added that one of the major things that the state wants to do with the Nabard loan is set up cold storages in 341 blocks of the state. This would help strengthen rural infrastructure.The falling paddy prices are likely to affect two major crops in the state - potato and paddy. This has led to fears that the total area coverage for produce this time will be much less as farmers are reluctant to take risks after two successive crops - last summer's boro and aman - failed to fetch even the production costs.Most farmers don't have money to hire labourers to reap the harvest, so they are not in a hurry to raise a nursery for the next crop and many have opted for distress sale."

In Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Assam also it was partial.'Kirana' and neighbourhood shops remained open in a majority of places. In Delhi, markets like Sarojini Nagar and INA disassociated from the day-long strike call, saying the protest was uncalled for.Shopkeepers in many cities took out marches demanding a rollback of the government move even as traders' bodies said the decision will create an uneven playing field in the country which will tilt towards multi-national companies and prove to be a ""nightmare"" for traders and consumers.Confederation of All India Traders' (CAIT) Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal claimed traders across the country were participating in the strike.""Around five crore traders belonging to 10,000 traders' bodies across the country are participating in the bandh.

It can be boring for children to have rice and sambar every day. So, we have suggested that more varieties such as millets be introduced, provided it is practical and suits the taste of children, said Rita Chatterjee, Joint Secretary, MHRD, who headed the team.The Central team, which is touring various States to review the system of fund flow, payment of cost of food grains and infrastructure at noon meal centres, among others, visited three districts  Namakkal, Krishnagiri and Vellore. The team had several meetings in Chennai. Lauding the scheme, Ms. Chatterjee said there are many lessons that other States could learn from Tamil Nadu. The quality of rice, meticulous maintenance of record books and state of kitchens received special mention. Other suggestions offered to the Department of Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme include improving community participation and packaging of food grains. We noticed that when sacks of food grains reach school much is lost, FCI should take up packaging to ensure there is minimal loss in the process, Ms. Chatterjee added.Senior officials of said the suggestions are welcome and the modalities on bringing in more variety in the menu can be worked out.The current menu includes white rice, vegetable sambar, and boiled egg served all five working days of the week. On Friday potatoes are also included in the menu.Chef Damu, who was previously approached by the Department to spice up the mid-day menu, feels while millets are more nutritious than rice the challenge is in introducing these fibre foods in a State where a majority are rice eaters.It is important to break the monotony in the menu to make food more appealing and also to prevent wastage, said Mr. Damu. Many varieties can be served even with ragi and millets by using the same ingredients in the menu.According to K. Shanmugavelayutham, convener of voluntary organisation TN-Forces and who accompanied the Central team, the local bodies and school management committee should take part in supervision of mid-day meal scheme and also in suggesting the menu. Nutrition and hygiene level should be improved further'', he added."

On July 16 food inflation stood at 7.16 per cent.The fall in inflation is due to fall in prices of essential items such as onions, potatoes and wheat giving relief to the common man, while rice and vegetables prices increased at a moderate pace. The declining trend has come as a relief to the government which is facing flak from the corporate India as well as the Opposition parties for not being able to manage the economy efficiently and effectively.Reacting to the declining inflationary trend, a relieved Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said: If this trend continues, perhaps we may have the year-end inflation at around 6-7 per cent.Onions became cheaper by 40.65 per cent year-on-year during the week under review, while potato prices were down by 10.98 per cent. Wheat prices also fell by 4.71 per cent.There was respite for the households as rice prices increased only by 2.52 per cent and vegetables by 5.13 per cent. Inflation with regard to vegetables, which are also affected by seasonal factors, had remained in double digit in the past months. However, prices of protein-based items such as milk, egg, meat and fish rose by double-digits.Experts feel that the fall in inflation could also have a positive spin-off for the industry and the middle-class borrowers since it sends a signal to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for a pause in the interest rates hike.The RBI will review the interest rates on December 16.After August, for the first time food inflation has come down to 8 per cent. Non-food inflation is steadily declining. In October 29, it was 6 per cent and now it has declined to 2.14 per cent, Mr. Mukherjee said.Inflation in the overall primary articles category stood at 7.74 per cent during the week ended November 19, as against 9.08 per cent in the previous week.Inflation in non-food articles was 2.14 per cent during the week under review, as against 4.05 per cent in the previous week ended November 12.Headline inflation has been above the 9 per cent-mark since December, 2010.

Nearly 1,200 wholesale and retail traders at Malgodown and over 1,000 traders at Chhatrabazar had closed their business establishments to extend support to the nationwide bandh called by the confederation of All India Traders Association today. Traders in Sambalpur also observed the bandh today. The strike caused some tempers to flare up as hundreds of retail and small traders, who had come to Chhatrabazar to buy vegetables, had to return empty handed. I visit Chhatrabazar to buy potatoes and other vegetables at least twice a week. But today, I had no information about the bandh. I will have to come back tomorrow, said Ramesh Swain, a trader from Chandikhol. The prices of vegetables and other items in the city were not affected as the shopkeepers had already kept enough stock to meet their daily requirements. We knew that there would be a strike, said a shopkeeper at Dolamundai. Around 5,000 people consisting of wholesalers, retail traders, middlemen, farmers and labourers are directly involved in the day-to-day fruits and vegetable trade at Chhatrabazar, which caters to the bulk of the vegetable requirement not only for people of Cuttack, but also for the nearby cities, said Chhatrabazar Byabasayi Sangh general secretary Devendra Sahu. Sahu claimed that Chhatrabazar market conducted a daily business of around Rs 3 to 4 crore. Around 50 to 60 trucks are engaged in the transporting fruits and vegetables to other parts of the state. Similar scenes were witnessed at Malgodown, where all the shops were closed since morning. Protesting against the 51 per cent FDI proposals in the retail sector, around 1,200 traders at Malgodown have joined the 12-hour bandh to show solidarity against the Centres decision, said Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Srikant Kumar Sahoo. Sahoo claimed that business worth Rs 10 crore had been affected by the 12-hour bandh today. The Odisha Rice Merchants Association, Retail Traders Association, Cuttack Vyabasayi Sangha, Textile Merchants Association and Readymade Garment Merchants Association had also extended their support to the bandh by closing their establishments at the Malgodown area today. The representatives of Cuttack Chamber of Commerce later submitted a memorandum to the district collector, S.N. Girish, listing their grievances against the proposal of the Union government to allow FDI in retail trade. Though the Centre has said it would allow only 51 per cent FDI in cities with over 10 lakh population, the livelihood of thousands of retail traders would be affected. This would lead to further price rise in essential commodities. A state-level meeting would be held on December 11 in Bhubaneswar to chalk out the next course of action in this regard, Sahoo said. Political parties including the BJP, CPI(M) and Socialist Unity Centre of India also took out rallies and staged protests at various parts of the city to register their protest. We are completely against the proposal, said president of Odisha Khrudya Utha Dokani Mahasangha Subhas Singh. Singh claimed that there were nearly 5 lakh retailers in the Odisha and nearly 1lakh traders in Cuttack who would be affected if FDI were allowed in the retail sector."

The farmers who are harvesting early sown potato crop are getting Rs 3 per kg and these are the lowest rates. Prices should have been at least Rs 5-6 per kg to save farmers from losses, a potato grower from Jalandhar said.In a scene reminiscent of Jharkhand where the farmers last year dumped the bumper tomato crop on the roads as the produce was selling fpor 50 paise per kg,the potato farmers in Punjab too have taken a similar step to highlight their woes.With their being no major demand from other states,the farmers said if state government fails to help them export the crop to other countries,they would be forced to dump nearly 50 lakh bags, each containing 50 kg potato on the roads. This would translate into 2.5 lakh tonnes of potato.Potato growers said that the state government should either take the onus to export the crop to other countries or provide freight subsidy so that the farmers could transport it to foreign shores.Following the sharp dip in the prices,the farmers say they can not send it to other states. Even storing the crop in the cold storage is not feasible due to high charges of nearly Rs 70 per bag, said a farmer.In the last season I had sent 5,000 bags to cold storage. I have been to sell only 2,000 bags that too at a very low price. Now,I have dumped the remaining 3,000 bags at various places as I cannot afford to pay the rent at the cold storage, Amarjit Singh,a potato grower from of Chak Chela village,said.Other farmers like Joga Singh and Swaran Singh,both from Jalandhar,also dumped upto 400 bags each by the road side.Farmers have been forced to dump the last seasons crop,as there are no buyers and most of them cant bear the expenses of cold storage, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha,general secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA).The prices of potato have crashed from Rs 800 per quintal last year to Rs 100 to 150 per quintal this year. There was a bumper crop in Punjab in January this year. Other states such as UP and West Bengal too recorded good produce,resulting in low price of potato, Sangha said.In fact,there is no fixed price for the crop harvested in January-february 2011 lying in the cold stores. The new crop is being sold at Rs 300 per quintal, he added.Nearly 50 lakh bags (2.5 lakh tonnes) of the last seasons crop are still lying in the cold stores.It may be noted that Doaba region with nearly 85,000 hectares under potato production leads the state in producing the crop.JPGA press secretary,Iqbal Singh Chatta,said that that last year Punjab produced more then 2.1 million tonnes of potatoes. In the current season the figures would go up. The state has a capacity to store nearly 16 lakh tonnes of potato in some 500 cold stores.Sangha added that they have met the government authorities several times since January this year to make arrangements to export the potato to other countries,but to no avail.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Public money was embezzled in the name of procuring potatoes from farmers who were in trouble because of a bumper production last year. A sum of Rs 180 crore was misused. Although a departmental inquiry (that had been ordered during the Left regime) is on, we want to unearth the actual reason behind the loss. I had proposed a CID inquiry and the chief minister has approved it, agriculture marketing minister Arup Roy told The Telegraph. He said an official order would be issued soon. In 2010, the Left Front government had spent Rs 400 crore to procure 9.7 lakh tonnes of potatoes from farmers at Rs 3.50 a kilo, the move aimed at preventing distress sale at rock-bottom prices ranging between Re 1 and Rs 1.50 a kilo. According to an agro-marketing department official, the Left government had planned to sell the potatoes in the open market or through ration shops once the prices stabilised. The government did not have any plans of earning any profit, it only wanted to recover the cost of procurement, the official said. The potatoes had been procured through three co-operative societies  Benfed, Confed and ECSC. But when all stocks were cleared from the cold storages in December last year, it was calculated that the agencies had suffered a combined loss of Rs 180 crore, the official said. There was a buzz then in the government that either the agencies had not procured what they had claimed to have or the cold storage owners had sold potatoes keeping the co-operatives in the dark. Such malpractice would not have been possible without the involvement of senior government officials or ministers, Roy said."
313,Stored potatoes may be routed to state schools for mid-day meals,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Stored-potatoes-may-be-routed-to-state-schools-for-mid-day-meals/articleshow/11013065.cms,2011-12-07,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: Who will purchase six lakh tonnes of potato lying in cold storage units in the state?With traders - who stocked the produce in cold storage - staring at huge losses as consumers prefer fresh potatoes coming to markets from other states, the state agriculture marketing department is now pleading with the school education department to purchase the potato for mid-day meals.But last year, there were allegations of serving ""rotten potatoes"" to schools in mid-day meals around January-February, the reason why the quality of the potatoes to be supplied again in schools is already being questioned.The agriculture marketing and education department officials discussed on Monday the possibility of supplying potatoes to 70,000 primary schools throughout the state where mid-day meals are cooked and served to children.""About 5,000 to 7,000 tonnes of potatoes could be supplied to these schools, a week. That will take a lot of the stored potatoes,"" a senior official said on Tuesday. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee and chief secretary Samar Ghosh will take the final decision on this on Wednesday. The school education department apparently has no problem with it, but the decision has to be taken at the top-most level.There has been a bumper crop this season and if the additional stock is not cleared, they will perish. Already the cold storage owners have been asked to keep the stores open for another couple of weeks. Usually cold storages are cleared and shut on November 15 for annual repair and maintenance and they re-open on February 15.An official, however, allayed fears among schools of the potatoes being rotten, arguing that last year the potatoes were supplied to the schools in January-February, and now they are still ""fresh"". ""Moreover, we will ask the school authorities to pick and choose the supply, so there cannot be allegations about thrusting the supply on them,"" said an official.However, last week some of the leading retailers in the city refused to pick up the potatoes from cold storages despite the state government's plea because fresh stocks have started arriving into Bengal already.Moreover, the argument of the retailers was that people do not mind paying more to buy fresh potato instead of the dehydrated ones from cold storages that have sprouts and taste sweet.West Bengal has been unable to sell potato to either Assam or Orissa - two of its major consumers - this year, with Bihar offering more competitive prices. Even now, the higher price of potato from other states - three times more than the cold storage variety - hasn't improved the market share of the old stock.Therefore, the only option remaining with the agricultural marketing department is to ask the school education department to pick up stocks from cold storages. Usually, the rice for mid-day meals is supplied through Food Corporation of India (FCI), daal is supplied through private agencies after a formal selection procedure, and the vegetables are purchased by self help groups locally from the market. These self help groups also cook the meals in schools.The market price of the potato is Rs 7to 9 per kg, and at the cold storages, they will get it at half the price, the official added.ENDS"

Fret not. Chemistry is here to help you identify adulterated food. You need not go to a laboratory anymore... small experiments in your kitchen will help you identify the adulterated ones.Students of St Agnes College proved that food adulteration can be checked with a little bit of chemistry in the kitchen.Sr Reshma Rodrigues and Sr Cicilia Crasta, III BSc Life Science students, of told TOI that homemakers can find out whether wheat flour contains chalk powder or honey that's bought at a high price has jaggery content in it or not, by doing simple chemical experiments. In fact, their project grabbed the attention of many students and teaching faculty at Chem Fiesta, an exhibition on Chemistry organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry by department of chemistry students of St Agnes College here on Wednesday.Sr Reshma said, ""Some traders mix chalk powder with wheat flour to increase their profit. This adulteration can be identified using just few drops of carbon tetrachloride solution. Put small quantity of wheat flour into the solution and stir it for a few seconds. While wheat flour will be dissolved in the solution, chalk powder will settle down at the bottom.""She said the same experiment can be repeated to know whether the pepper brought from the market is adulterated with dried papaya seeds. ""Pepper will remain unchanged in the solution while papaya seeds will start bulging,"" she explained. The profit of traders' increases when they add crushed brick fines to a packet of chilli powder. No one will be able to notice it without doing a chemical analysis. Same tetrachloride solution experiment will work here too, she explained.Reshma and Cicilia said adulteration in ghee, honey and many other food items can also be easily found with the help of Chemistry. The quantity of ghee increases when it is adulterated by mixing boiled and crushed potato in it. ""This can be identified by dropping a small quantity of such ghee into iodine solution. While potato starch content will turn into deep blue, ghee will float on the solution. Similarly, aniline hydrochloride will turn the jaggery content in adulterated honey into orange,"" they explained."

It was recorded at 8.93 per cent in the corresponding period last year.According to data released by the government today, onions became cheaper by 39.20 per cent year-on-year during the week under review, while potato prices were down by 15.75 per cent. Prices of wheat also fell by 4.70 per cent.Overall, vegetables became cheaper by 1.25 per cent, a big relief after double-digit inflation in vegetable prices during the months of September and October.However, other food products grew more expensive on an annual basis, led by protein-based items.Pulses became 13 per cent costlier during the week under review, while milk grew dearer by 11.02 per cent and eggs, meat and fish by 10.04 per cent.Fruits also became 10.72 per cent more expensive on an annual basis, while cereal prices were up by 1.68 per cent.Inflation in the overall primary articles category stood at 6.92 per cent during the week ended November 26, as against 7.74 per cent in the previous week.

An unrelenting Opposition accused the government of pursuing wrong economic policies. According to the government data released on Thursday, food prices index was down due to fast softening of onion, potato and wheat prices. Onion was cheaper by close to 40 per cent in the week under review, while potato prices were down by nearly 16 per cent.Food inflation stood at 8 per cent in the previous week. But, the prices of protein-based items continued to grow more expensive on an annual basis. Replying to the debate on price rise in Rajya Sabha, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said the food prices were continuously showing a downward trend in the past weeks, but maintained that the prices would not come down overnight.He attributed the rise in overall prices to poor distribution system, international economy and rise in global petroleum prices.He also sought the cooperation of the Opposition in containing prices and carrying out reforms, especially in foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail. The BJP, however, rejected the state of helplessness expressed by the finance minister and staged a walk out from the House.Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said rampant corruption in the government along with wrong economic policies was responsible for the skyrocketing prices.Gurudas Dasgupta of the CPI, who attributed the current softening of prices to seasonal factors, asked the government to aim at brining down inflation in the long term.Experts too said the decline in inflation is an outcome of the plentiful kharif harvest.Economists maintained it was too early for the Reserve Bank of India to reverse its monetary policy stance although growth in the previous quarters was stuttering.Although the growth scare has intensified in the last few months, it is too premature to say RBI will completely reverse its stance on December 16. A rate cut may come next March if inflation continues to decline, Jyotinder Kaur, an economist with HDFC Bank, told Deccan Herald.India's economy expanded 6.9 per cent during July and September, slowing from 7.7 per cent in the preceding quarter."

Markfed MD Ajit Singh Pannu said they were working out the subsidy quantum, but its modalities would remain the same as for 2009.While he refused to say anything about the quantum or rate of subsidy, sources said the rate would also be the same as last year - 50 paisa per kg for transporting within the country and Rs 1.50 per kg for exports.However, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association president Raghbir Singh and general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha said this would be insufficient. ""When rates of transportation have increased, the subsidy should also be increased and it should be Re 1 per kg for domestic transportation and Rs 2 for exports,"" they demanded.""The state government should take steps immediately as election code may come into force anytime,"" they argued.Meanwhile, Sangha said they had already called a meeting of potato growers from the region on December 10 when the date and time of the agitation would be chalked out. By agitation, they meant they would simply throw tonnes of potatoes on roads of Jalandhar, he said.One grower Surjit Singh Jallowal distributed potatoes free to people in vegetable market in Maqsoodan on Monday. According to JPGA, around 20 lakh quintals of the crop is lying in cold stores and they were not even getting Re 1 per kg when their cold storage cost was around Rs 3 per kg."
318,Food inflation at 3-yr low of 6.6%,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Food-inflation-at-3-yr-low-of-66/articleshow/11038225.cms,2011-12-09,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Food inflation eased significantly in late November as prices of vegetables, onions, potatoes and other items softened due to improved supplies, providing relief for policymakers who are grappling with a difficult economic situation.Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Thursday showed food inflation moderated to a more than three-year low at 6.60% in the week to November 26, easing from the previous week's 8%. It stood at 6.19% in the week to August 9, 2008.Stubbornly high food prices have posed a serious challenge for policymakers and upset household budgets. High food prices have also led to protests. Food inflation has hovered around double digits for a significant period while overall inflation is still near double digits.Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee defended the government strategy to deal with price pressures and said retail prices of 30 essential commodities, including that of rice, wheat and pulses, had either fallen or had registered a marginal increase during the past two years.""It is not correct to say that government has not done anything,"" Mukherjee told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.Economists said the downtrend in food prices and slowing growth could prompt the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to pause in its interest rate tightening cycle. The RBI will undertake a policy review next week and most experts say they expect the central bank to hold rates at current levels. The RBI has raised interest rates 13 times since March 2010 to calm price pressures but they have remained stubborn.The latest data showed vegetable prices fell an annual 1.25% in the week to November 26 after rising sharply for the past few weeks. Onion prices continued to decline and fell 39.20% year-on-year while potato prices were down an annual 15.75%. Prices of milk, egg, meat and fish continued to remain firm.The index for food articles group declined by 1% to 193.8 from 195.7 for the previous week due to lower prices of fish-inland and jowar (3% each), fruits and vegetables, condiments and spices, masur and urad (2% each) and fish-marine, poultry chicken, barley and moong (1% each). But prices of ragi (3%), pork (2%) and gram, mutton, maize, egg and arhar (1% each) moved up.Policymakers expect overall inflation to ease to 6-7% range by end-March but economists say it will hover above the comfort level. On Thursday, ratings agency Crisil marginally revised upwards its forecast for inflation in 2011-12 to 9.2% from the previous 9.1%.""This is because the continuous weakening of the rupee has exerted additional pressure on the imported component of inflation. We now expect the rupee to end the fiscal year at a lower value of Rs 48 per dollar as compared to the earlier forecast of Rs 45-46 per dollar. This will keep inflation at higher levels than expected earlier,"" said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.He said the upward revision in inflation also takes into account the continuing firmness in global crude oil prices which if it continues, could result in further fuel price pass through into domestic economy, since there is limited fiscal room to absorb further subsidies.The agency also cut its forecast for gross domestic product growth for 2011-12 to 7% from the previous estimate of 7.6% due to the weak global economic situation and the domestic investment climate."

Food inflation during the like week in the previous year was higher at close to 9 per cent.However, even as there are apprehensions in certain quarters over what steps the Reserve Bank of India chooses to take during its monetary policy review on December 16 to tame overall inflation despite the slowdown in growth, the timely easing of food inflation is likely to provide some comfort to the apex bank. The official data revealed that while onions turned cheaper by 39.20 per cent, prices of potatoes and wheat also declined by 15.75 per cent and 4.70 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis. For a change, prices of vegetables as a whole also eased by 1.25 per cent to provide some relief from double-digit inflation in kitchen greens in the past few months.The bad news, however, is that prices of protein-rich items such as pulses, eggs, meat and fish has continued to soar during the week on an annual basis. As per the WPI data, pulses turned dearer by 13 per cent and milk by 11.02 per cent while prices of eggs, meat and fish went up by 10.04 per cent. Keeping pace, fruits also were costlier by 10.72 per cent, as were cereals by 1.68 per cent.According to Crisil's chief economist D. K. Joshi, while food inflation is expected to moderate in the months ahead following a good farm output, the high inflation in protein-rich items is owing to structural factors. In the overall primary articles category, inflation stood at 6.92 per cent during the November 26 week as against 7.74 per cent in the previous week."

321, + whisky = price-tail ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1111209/jsp/nation/story_14859471.jsp,2011-12-09,Telegraph,"Comrade, its cauliflower season New Delhi, Dec. 8: The humble potol just got a high-end comrade. A drink called whisky. Thanks to a comrade. Members of Parliament were today served potol and whisky, but not because they make a mouth-watering combination. Its just that a venerable comrade wanted to make a point. CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta, the man who came up with the rather unusual menu, cited the price of the summer season vegetable to highlight the plight of the common mans struggle with food inflation and contrast it with the prices of an alcoholic drink. Pranabbabu bazaar jaatey hain ya nahin, lekin hum jaatey hai (Pranabbabu goes to the market or not, but I go), he said, referring to finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. Today, the price of bhindi (ladies finger) is Rs 75 a kg I am telling about Delhi market . In Calcuttas Lake Market, the price of potol is Rs 80 a kg. If some MPs wondered why the Left leader was quoting prices of vegetables generally not grown in winter, instead of, say, seasonal vegetables like phulkopi (cauliflower), Dasgupta had his reasons. He was, perhaps, aware that the latest figures announced today showed that inflation had come down. But the comrade, who initiated a debate over price rise in the Lok Sabha this afternoon, carried on undaunted. He quoted the price of potatoes, now hovering around Rs 12 a kg. I agree that prices of some seasonal vegetables have gone down. But the general panorama of sky-high price has not yet been liquidated, he said. Perhaps realising that he had not made his point, Dasgupta contrasted the price of potatoes now with that in 2001 (Rs 7.92 a kg). It has not doubled but it is near double, he said. It was at this point that whisky entered the debate. These are the prices for the poor people. I am not speaking of whisky. Price of whisky has not gone up, thanks to the government. I thank the government, Dasgupta said, without going into how much a bottle of whisky costs now and what it did a few years back. It was too good a chance to let slip to rib the comrade. How do you know prices of whisky have not gone up? intervened Trinamul Congress member Dinesh Trivedi. If the railway minister seized the spirit of the moment, his double-edged comment put Dasgupta on the back foot as other MPs broke into laughter. I have collected the information for your benefit so that you can have a cheap bottle tomorrow night, Dasgupta retorted. Later, outside Parliament, some MPs were heard wondering why tomorrow night and not tonight. When his turn came to speak, Trinamul MP Kalyan Banerjee didnt miss the chance to pull the leg of the comrade. Gurudasda has the courage to buy potol.... I can only buy phulkopi (cauliflower) in this season, Banerjee said. It seems he must be having phulkopi in the summer. Dasgupta was not present in the House when Banerjee spoke. He had left by then."

While it would cost the government dearer, the state is willing to shell out the money in the interest of the producers, state agriculture minister Arup Roy said while making the announcement on Thursday.Roy added that an appeal has also been made to the school education department through the CMO, asking nearly 70,000 state-run primary schools to purchase potatoes for their mid-day meal programme. The school education department has not yet responded, but there are speculations on the quality of the potatoes. Last year, the schools were asked to do the same, but there were allegations that they had already started rotting.However, the question that immediately cropped up regarding export was that where could the potatoes be routed and who would buy them from Bengal? According to an official, Sri Lanka buys potatoes from Bangladesh and there is a long-term agreement. But Bangladesh, too, has produced a bumper crop this year.Cold storages are usually cleared and shut on November 15 for annual maintenance and reopens on February 15. The government is now pleading with the owners to allow them store the potatoes till December 15, but time is running out. Last week, some retailers refused to buy these potatoes as fresh stocks have started arriving. They felt people won't mind paying an extra buck to buy fresh potatoes. , so people don't mind paying more to buy fresh potato instead of the dehydrated ones from cold storages."

With his frizzy Afro, mutton-chop sideburns and total football swagger, none better typified the 1970s than Der Afro.The former Bayern Munich and Real Madrid legend was in town on Friday to formally announce the Audi Football Summit, which will see Bayern Munich face India at the JLN Stadium in Bhaichung Bhutia's farewell match on January 10. He spoke to HT.ExcerptsTalk us through your spur-of-the-moment equalising penalty against Holland in the 1974 World Cup final?It wasn't decided (who would take the spot-kick). As I was standing closest, I took the ball without thinking. I just wanted to equalise, I was convinced I would do it. I wouldn't become a hero, I'd become a world champion.Holland and Germany are the most remembered teams from the 1974 World Cup. Were they best?The best team in the 1974 wasn't Holland or Germany. It was Poland, they had many great players (Grezegorg) Lato, (Kazimierz) Deyna. However, in the World Cup they couldn't play the way they had played even a month before the event. We beat them in the semis, but they were the best team there.What went wrong in the 1982 World Cup final against Italy (3-1)?Italy played on Wednesday and won easily (2-0 over Poland). We played on Thursday at Sevilla (5-4 penalty win over France after 3-3 final score), we played 90 minutes, then extra-time. On Friday morning, we reached Madrid with no food or drinks in our hotel room. So, two days before the final we knew we would have only a 20-25 % chance.You were once pictured with a poster of chairman Mao in the background and regularly gave your opinion on matters off the field? Is there a place for a cerebral and opinionated footballers now, say a character like Socrates?I see how difficult it is to develop a special personality today. I could develop as a person till I was 18. Today, when you're 13-14 you have to follow a fixed, step-by-step path, where it's all about football.Your many talents include acting. You featured in the 1976 western Potato Fritz. How different was a film studio from the football field?It wasn't all the different. The reason I acted in this film was because it was being filmed near Madrid (when he was playing for Real) and I knew many of the actors and the producers, who were from Munich. They called me to ask 'Paul we are shooting a western in Madrid, if you have the time could come to the studio' It was great fun.In 1977, you stunned the football world by leaving Spanish giants Real Madrid for the relative obscurity of German provincial outfit Eintracht Braunschweig. Why?I would have liked to transfer to the New York Cosmos or Paris, but my wife wanted to return to Germany our daughters were now 5 and 6 years old and were about to enter school. My wife wanted them to be schooled in Germany. At the time there were only two clubs who could pay Real Madrid the huge transfer fee, and one was this small provincial club, which had the right backers. As so often, it was just a case of money.Can Bayern Munich win a fifth Champions League crown when the host this year's final at the Allianz Arena in May?We started the season in great form, had a slight dip after that but now the team is playing very good. I just hope we don't play Barcelona in the quarter-final or semis, but the final. It gives a us a great chance to beat them in a one-off game, and not over two legs, because Barcelona, like Spain, are the best team in the world. But, Germany is a close second.What plagued German football in the decade following the win at Italia '90?In the 1990s, we made a big mistake. We thought we were the best, and played the same old way, while the rest of the world and football evolved. Around 2000, we accepted that we had to change. So, we saw how world football had developed, and importantly there was a change in the thought process. Earlier, we taught our kids to be football workers, no we tell them to be football players! After 6-8 years we now have the first generation educated the new way and they are now almost at the highest level, at Spain's level. In a couple of years we should even topple them.What do you make of Germany's chance in next year's Euro (they've been grouped alongside Holland, Portugal and Denmark)?I said after the draw, 'don't talk to me about it'. We say we are the second-best team in the world, behind Spain, we are convinced. If so, what's the need to think about the Netherlands, Portugal or Denmark? We must think about our game, not the opposition. Reach the final, and beat Spain.Manchester United failed to make the last-16 after six years. Anything wrong at Old Trafford?In the last three-four years Manchester United maybe made the same mistake that Germany made during the 1990s. They thought they are the best and don't have to learn, don't have to look at others. They finished first or second in the EPL, but now it's not enough as the others have caught up. All the English clubs should look at the situation. They need to re-look their football year after year, not play the football of 2005. Also many of the high-class players in England like (Didier) Drogba, (Frank) Lampard and (Steven) Gerrard are now older and the younger guys have failed to step up on a day-to-day basis.Manchester City also failed to advance to the last16 despite splurging in the transfer market. How would you rate the Man City-Chelsea-PSG business model?It's not a successful model. A successful business model is the Bayern Munich business model. We win titles, and, we earn money. They (Man City/Chelsea) don't win anything and loose money. For example Mr (Roman) Abramovich (Chelsea owner) spent 1.6 billion euros with an aim to win the Champions League from scratch in six years and failed. Instead of loosing 1.6 billion Bayern (Rs 11096 crore) has posted a net profit of 20 million euros (Rs 138 crore) in the last six years and have won many titles.Man Citythey play in the Europa League. The way they operate is having a critical effect on the way football is played because nobody knows where it's going to end.UEFA president Michel Platini has vocally advocated the financial fairplay rules. Do you think they will work?I don't believe in Platini's financial fairplay because I believe clubs will still function the way they always have they will continue to spend money lavishly in the transfer market, they will keep posting losses. So, no, I don't think financial fairplay is feasible.You've played six El Clasicos (winning 4) during your time at Real. Can you expand on the thrill of playing in a Clasico?To play for Madrid in the Clasico, back when over 150,000 fans would throng to the old Bernabeu, was indescribable. It was spectacular. Playing in these Clasicos has been one of the greatest moments in my life, alongside winning the World Cup. For Barcelona and Real Madrid fans, the outcome of the season is irrelevant. For Real the only objective is to finish ahead of Barcelona, and vice versa. This is the only important thing for both clubs.Your thoughts on Saturday's El Clasico?Barcelona are still the best club in the world, but their form has dipped of late.

Due to the excess supply of the crop this year, farmers are fetching unexpectedly low rates of Rs.1 per kg for potato that was in cold storage, and Rs.2-3 per kg for early-sown crop. - PTI"

Photo: H. VibhuThe life of Pandian, a small-time Bengal gram vendor on the Tamil Nadu side of the Kumily check-post, is headed for a crisis.The agitations on either side of the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border over the Mullaperiyar dam during the past eight days have denied him his livelihood. He could not open his rickety shop near the border since the thoroughfare remains blocked by protestors from the neighbouring States.During the pilgrim and the tourist seasons, I used to sell fried Bengal gram, banana chips, and groundnut for around Rs.900 a day. These days I could not sell even a single packet, says Mr. Pandian, sieving the pulses. The agitations have robbed the likes of Mr. Pandian of their livelihood.As the agitations intensify during the peak tourism season, hundreds are being denied of their livelihood options at Kumily town and its adjoining areas, which are heavily dependent on tourism. Tour operators, hoteliers, tourist guides, and traders complain that they could not cash in on the first half of the tourist season following the strife.The agitations have forced Syed Mustafa, an autorickshaw driver in Kumili town, into an unprecedented crisis. He is finding it difficult to repay a loan raised from a private moneylender as the income from the autorickshaw has plummeted.When people travelled freely across the border, I used to earn around Rs.800 a day, from which I repaid the loan. Now, I am hardly earning what is required for food and fuel, says Mr. Mustafa, in a worried tone.The flow of guests to the Periyar Tiger Reserve has thinned following the tension. There are only a few takers for the boat ride in Periyar Lake and eco-tourism activities such as jungle scout, bamboo rafting, border hiking, and jungle walk since the agitation intensified, says an official of the reserve.Two bullock carts owned by an Eco Development Committee, used for cart rides for tourists, were burned down by protestors causing a loss of Rs.40,000. It is estimated that there has been a 25 per cent reduction in tourism activities and this will be reflected in the revenue earned by the reserve and the committees.The agitation has impacted Jayasree Viswambharan, a vegetable vendor, in an altogether different manner. She is seeking ways to dispose of the huge quantity of vegetables that are rotting inside her shop.Huge quantities of unsold bitter gourd, carrot, and tomato have been damaged causing considerable financial loss. During the pre-agitation days, I used to sell vegetables for around Rs.40,000. As people are scared to come out and shop, sales have plummeted, she says.The price of vegetables including beans, onion, and potato has doubled since the agitation. Milk supply from Tamil Nadu has also stopped, she says. The snapping of supply lines has also resulted in price rise and shortage of victuals. In Kumily, everyone is hoping for an early settlement of the issue, hoping to get back to normal life."

As a consequence, the Manipuri people have been subjected to massive hardship. It is reliably learnt that a litre of petrol is currently being sold for Rs 200 while a gas cylinder costs as much as Rs 2,000. While, a kilogram of potato is selling at Rs 20 to Rs 25. The hospitals are running short of life saving drugs; oxygen cylinders are becoming scarce, the petition said.However, Nariman, on his part, submitted that Central Government has devised a plan under which the local police and Railway Protection Force (RPF) have to deal with the issue of blockades within 24 hours.If they failed to resolve the matter, the Home Secretary would hold consultation with the state police chief and try to diffuse the crisis with the aid of the available para-military services.Earlier, the Kuki tribes, demanding the formation of a Sadar Hills District, blocked two national highways this year on August 1, 2011.The blockade was lifted on November 1, 2011 after the Manipur government conceded to their demand for the conversion of Kuki majority Sadar Hills into a full-fledged district.The Nagas, who were opposed to the carving out of a separate district for the Kukis, launched a counter-blockade on August 21 on the two highways, adding to hardships for the people said the petition."

The MIS is implemented in order to protect the interests of growers to avoid distress sale in the event of bumper crop when prices tend to fall below the cost of production,as has happened in Punjab for potato crop.Unions including Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA),Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers (POSCON) and Bhartiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) stated that due to bumper production,40 lakh bags of crop are still lying in cold storage.JGPA president Raghbir Singh said that when there was glut in Bengal in 2009,Centre had given Rs 85 crore subsidy to the potato growers and the same can be done in Punjab. We need a minimum of Rs 2 per kg freight subsidy, added JS Sangha,the JPGA general secretary. The farmers said that they should either be given a place to dump their crop or the government should purchase it.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

There is no consistency in employment in our place, but here there are sufficient jobs, with handsome payment. So, now coffee plantations are our livelihood. We grow rice, onion, potatoes and tomatoes, but we don't get fair prices for our crops,"" added Chandru, who hails from Chaudiapuli, Orissa. ""I have come down here along with my wife and two children. We spend one month every year in March in our native place,"" he said.Working in these estates has given them more money and work round the year. However, there are language barriers between the workers.The labourers spend a little money to buy foods and other household items and the rest goes into saving and sending to their family in Orissa every week without fail. Children of these labourers are deprived of education due language barriers, since most schools operate in Kannada medium.Guruprasad, labour officer, Hassan, speaking to TOI said: ""According to Plantation Acts, planters must provide accommodation facility as well as bear medical expenses of labourers who have migrated here from other regions. The Act also has provisions for opening of special schools under Sarva Shikshana Abhiyana called 'tent schools' to educate the children of labourers, he said. Most of the labourers take money in advance, and so it becomes difficult to implement certain programmes,"" he added.B A Jaganath, former president, Karnataka Growers Federation, who has labourers from Orissa in his estates, said: ""Labourers who have migrated here have a hunger for work, whereas, locals labourers shirk work. So we provide the migrants all the facilities possible for their welfare. We involve them in mechanization work and they learn it quickly.""There around 60 such labourers on Jaganath's estate and he is trying adopt a boy named Kothresh from Harapanahalli, Davangere district, who has moved here with his family."

The farmers dumped about 5,000 to 6,000 quintals of potato on the road leading up to Jalandhar after police stepped in and prevented a large number of potato-filled trolleys from entering the city. Farmers,however,have threatened to intensify their agitation if the state government does not come to their aid.The potato growers are up in arms against the Rs 2 crore freight subsidy announced by the state government. Terming it as meagre,the farmers are demanding a subsidy of around Rs 140 crore.We should either be given a minimum of Rs 2 per kilogram of freight subsidy from the state government or state agencies like the NAFED can procure the crop at the rate of Rs 5 per kilogram to help out farmers,said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA),general secretary J S Sangha. The potato growers body general secretary further said that 40 lakh bags of the previous crop was lying in cold stores even as the new crop has started arriving. He added that some officials had promised the protesters,while they were dumping their produce,that the government would listen to their problems if they called off their agitation.According to Sangha,farmers had brought about 450 trolleys filled with potato bags to Jalandhar but with police stopping a large number of them at the citys Wadala chowk,the protesters began throwing their crop near the chowk and at various places on Nakodar road. The potato growers,later in the day,submitted a memorandum to the Jalandhar deputy commissioner.The government,however,had adequate warning of the farmers resolve as potato growers associations like the Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers (POSCON) ,Bhartiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) and others had announced that they dump their crop in protest,a few days ago.They had even managed to obtain permission to protest near the Guru Nanak Dev Chowk road to BMC Chowk and Circuit House in Jalandhar.Blame game over potato drainJalandhar: A blame game has begun over the protest by potato growers with state Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh and Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Badal blaming each other for the farmers plight.Amarinder said he regretted the plight of the potato growers who had to throw their produce on the roads at Jalandhar on Thursday in the absence of suitable prices. He also criticized the state government for failing in its recent commitment to the farmers to provide them freight subsidy.The state Congress chief blamed Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal for backing out on his commitment to the potato growers for providing freight subsidy. It is characteristic of Badal to make a commitment and bide time to wriggle out of a situation and then back out leaving the people high and dry,he remarked while adding,and that is precisely what he did with the potato growers.On the other hand Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal,on Thursday accused the Congress-led UPA government for deliberately scuttling the export of potatoes and basmati to other countries to punish Punjabi farmers for supporting SAD-BJP in Punjab.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

340,Food inflation at 4-yr low of 4.35%,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Food-inflation-at-4-yr-low-of-435/articleshow/11125385.cms,2011-12-16,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: The sharp fall in vegetable prices in the neighbourhood market is now showing in the food inflation numbers, which fell to a near four-year low of 4.35% in the week-ended December 3, easing the burden on the government which has been battling criticism over the way it has handled the price situation.The sharp fall from 10.63% in early November, was the result of prices of vegetables, potatoes, onions and wheat falling in the range of 4.43% to 46% due to better supplies. In some commodities such as potatoes which witnessed a 33% decline, farmers in several parts of the country are dumping the crop on the streets or letting it rot as there is a bumper harvest and cold storages are full with last year's stocks. In certain cases such as onions, where prices were down 46% due to the high base seen a year ago also came to the rescue. Milk seemed to be the only sour point with prices rising 11%.Food inflation stood at 6.6% in the previous week and 10.78% a year ago. The latest weekly food inflation number is the lowest since the week-ended February 23, 2008, when it was 4.28%. Buoyed by the steep decline in food prices, chief economic advisor Kaushik Basu said food inflation may go down below 3% in a month's time. ""I expect by the first week of January food inflation will go down below 3%.""The sharp easing comes ahead of RBI's review of monetary policy slated for Friday, where it is widely expected to hold key rates steady despite an anguished plea from the government to start cutting interest rates in the wake of falling GDP growth.""Headline inflation is expected to moderate further to around 8% in December, from 9.1% in November, as easing food price inflation would offset the impact of the recent rupee depreciation,"" ICRA economist Aditi Nayar said."

Now, with huge yield of ginger, there are literally no takers and the crop is left on the land to dry, which might go useless after sometime.A 60-kg bag of ginger was sold at Rs 500 to Rs 550 in October. Now, the rate has come down to Rs 300 to Rs 400 per bag. Though prices have crashed, there are no takers that has become a big headache for farmers who are perplexed with huge stock of the produce. The harvested yield is being left on the farm which is drying in the sun and rotting if there is rain.Ginger growers are also facing a lot of problems like pest attack. The blight disease, which is common for potato has infected ginger too. Now, it is difficult for the farmers to switch over to other crops like vegetables after taking steps to destroy the pests. The situation has turned worse and it has become inevitable to spray pesticides to even desi crops like ragi and maize, lament the farmers.The hike in labour charges have also affected the farmers. Moreover, they have to provide to and fro transportation facilities for them along with breakfast and lunch. Most of the farmers are not able to afford the expenses.Many of them, who had pledged their gold and valuables, in hope of good yield are now upset as they are not even able to meet their daily needs."

The sharp fall in the price of paddy over the past one year has made the situation worse. The memorandum said the farmers were compelled to sell paddy at a rate of Rs 600 to Rs 650 per quintal.The farmers demanded opening of purchase centres at Sonai, Bhaga, Joypur, Doodpatil, Salchapra and Katigora where they could get the minimum support price for paddy. ""The farmers of Haryana have been selling paddy at a minimum support price of Rs 1081 per quintal in accordance with the rate fixed by the centre. If the farmers of Punjab and Haryana can get the minimum support price, why not us,"" the memorandum said.According the department of agriculture, this year paddy has been cultivated in 55,295 hectare land in Cachar district. The target of production of paddy in this district is 186,212 MT. 65 per cent of the total produce is consumed or used locally. Therefore, 32,328 MT of paddy will remain surplus. The government can procure this at a minimum support price from the farmers, they said.According to Abdesh Singh, a farmer leader, FCI has been purchasing paddy from the Brahmaputra Valley, but not from the Barak Valley for the past three years. Due to the sharp fall in price of paddy, they have been facing loss of Rs 600 per bigha, he added.The farmers also alleged though there were 127 posts of gram sevoks in the Barak Valley, practically the number of working gram sevoks was 70. The government is not interested in filling up the rest of the posts either. Besides, the farmers said the department of agriculture this season had distributed potato seeds at least one month after their stipulated time.According to sources, while Cachar district got 2,000 quintals, Hailakandi got 12,000 quintals and Karimganj received 17,000 quintals of potato seeds in November. But the gesture was too late and came to little use for the farmers during this Ravi season.However, a daily wage earner in Silchar said the fall in price of paddy had come as blessings to the poor. ""Our cost of living has gone down to some extent,"" said Badar Uddin Laskar."
344,Rahul Gandhi comes out in strong support of FDI in retail,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Rahul-Gandhi-comes-out-in-strong-support-of-FDI-in-retail/articleshow/11139586.cms,2011-12-17,The Times Of India,"FARRUKHABAD: Rahul Gandhi has come out in full-throated support of foreign direct investment in retail. Turning the government's FDI setback into a poll weapon, Rahul on Friday asserted the Centre would implement the suspended policy. He slammed the opposition for sabotaging a move that would give farmers a higher return on their produce.Rahul dubbed the anti-FDI position of Congess's rivals - ranging from SP, BSP to BJP  as a betrayal of farmers, while pitching FDI in retail as a panacea to farmers of this region, known as the 'potato belt' of UP. Potato prices have hit rock bottom here.On his way to Kannauj, Rahul visited potato fields where he saw the produce rotting and ""pigs gorging on them"". At Ismailpur, he stopped at a roadside dhaba and asked a gathering of locals if they knew about FDI.The stridency contrasted with the way UPA agreed to suspend the decision to appease rebellious allies and the opposition after they refused to allow Parliament to function.Coming a couple of days after the PM's assertion that the policy would be rolled out by March, Rahul's pitch (reminiscent of his backing the nuclear deal) should rally the party and clear the way for entry of foreign multi-brand retail giants.Surprising all, Rahul told election gatherings across Farrukhabad and Kannauj that FDI would solve the puzzle of a kilogram of potato fetching Rs 2 or less to the farmer and a packet of potato chips costing Rs 10.""A packet of chips is made from just half a potato,"" he added, virtually turning the opposition to FDI into a conspiracy against farmers.Though a bold pitch, the advocacy for retail is not free of the risk of alienating Vaishyas: the traditional traders who are a factor in UP towns and who have increasingly been assertive in the political arena as well. The fallout among this constituency was one of the reasons why the Congress leadership persuaded the Prime Minister to put the decision on hold.On Friday, no doubts assailed Rahul as he launched an aggressive defence of FDI. He said foreign investment would bring in cold chains and processing units while establishing a direct contact between buyers and farmers, cutting out middlemen. In Kannauj, he went a step further to add ""that opposition notwithstanding, UPA will bring FDI in retail.""Rahul Gandhi deserves our congratulations for the political courage he has shown in speaking up for FDI in retail in the midst of a poll campaign in UP. Clearly, like this newspaper, he is convinced that the move would be genuinely beneficial for many more people than it would do harm. Unfortunately, his party and the government it presides over have not shown the same courage of conviction and chose to back off in the face of opposition. The government might protest that it is unfairly being accused of policy paralysis, but it could have let its deeds do the talking by sticking to a decision it had taken in the country's interests."

Had FDI in retail been there the farmers would not have seen such bad days.Mr. Gandhi said farmers complained that the market price of potato was Rs. 2 per kilo while the big companies sold potato chips at Rs. 10 per packet.The Amethi MP said FDI in retail would benefit, not harm, farmers in the long run.False support'Coming down on the Mayawati government's apparent show of support for farmers, Mr. Gandhi pointed to the vast tract of land, stretching from Noida to Gorakhpur, allotted to private builders.Sharpening his attack on the Samajwadi Party, Mr. Gandhi alleged that during the party's rule in the State, criminals enjoyed influence in police stations and no case would be registered there.He alleged that the Bahujan Samaj Party would siphon off money meant for development schemes in the State.Mr. Gandhi said none of the Opposition leaders ever visited people of the villages but they ridiculed him for taking the initiative.Rashid Masud, who recently quit the SP and joined the Congress, said he converted after SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav rejected his plea for reservation for backward and poor Muslims.Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister would take a decision on reservation for Muslims when he felt it appropriate.

This leads to debt and often cases of farmers committing suicide are reported from different corners of the state. But never do those deaths, caused due to debt, get recognition. Governments come and go. But the destiny of farmers in Bengal continues to remain the same.The same thing happened with Robin Burman of East Magurmari in Dhupguri in Jalpaiguri district. Overburdened with debt, the 55-year-old potato farmer committed suicide in the wee hours on Wednesday by hanging himself from a tree just beside the land he had taken on lease for cultivation.In the recent past, several cases of farmer suicides have been reported.

But he did not get the desired price for the 60 tonnes of the produce. So, he had kept it in cold storages hoping to sell it to recover the price but that didn't happen. He was very upset,"" said Ramprasad, Robin Burman's son.Family members said that Robin had loaned Rs 2.5 lakh at a very high rate of interest last year for the cultivation and had thought of clearing the debt by selling the potato. But the price of potato per kg of potato last year was only Rs 4 per kg because of which he did not sell his produce and thought of selling it later. This year, when new yields have already started flooding the markets, price of last year's yield come down to only Re 1 per kg.""Price of potato is expected to be very low this year. It is because of the surplus production that price realisation is very poor. The new yield that has reached the markets is fetching Rs 4-5 per kg, which is equal to the production cost for every kg of potato. Then there are other expenditures such as carrying, packaging and cold storage charges. If the weather condition continues to be in favour of potato cultivation, production will be higher lowering its price,"" said Raju Chakraborty, a potato trader.Although Jalpaiguri district magistrate Smaraki Mahapatra said she would probe into the case, kin and relatives of the deceased farmer sense that the government would never accept the fact that Robin had committed suicide due to the burden of debt on him."

Prices of wheat also fell by 4.21 per cent in the week under review. However, protein-based items grew expensive with pulses staying 4.22 per cent costlier, while milk grew dearer by 11.19 per cent and eggs, meat and fish by 9.25 per cent.Fruits also became 8.89 per cent more expensive on an annual basis. Inflation in the overall primary articles category stood at 3.78 per cent during the week ended December 10, as against 5.48 per cent in the previous week.

Indias economic growth also slowed to 6.9 per cent in the July-September quarter, lowest in more than two years.

352,Cold Comfort,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1111222/jsp/opinion/story_14910107.jsp,2011-12-22,Telegraph,"Nanjing in winter  cold winds, sub-zero temperatures, and no central heating. If the sun comes out, the citys broad roads with their famous old trees look inviting. But thats rare. Most days the skies are grey, the streets dreary. Come evening, traffic crawls in darkness; inside the cars, jackets come off, but only the foolhardy can step outside without cover. Electricity and gas bills shoot up as air-conditioners are set to heat all day and night and the gas supply kept on so that your hands dont freeze in the icy tap water. At least one considerate company keeps hand lotion in all its washrooms to ward off the dryness that comes with constant use of hot water. What do the poor do? Woollens are cheap; and a one-time expense. But food? One egg costs eight jiao (Rs 6), a little less than a yuan. Milk is Rs 87 a litre and potatoes Rs 48 per kg. But high-end Italian restaurants and three-table Spanish eateries are full, and not only with expats. In India, cold wave deaths are routine. In Nanjing, the death of a homeless migrant worker on the freezing streets makes news. The cleaning staff of Nanjing municipality recently struck work for a long overdue pay revision. Now, they grumble about having to buy additional woollens from their own salaries, for they are out morning to night. The costs of cooking gas and electricity for a normal household are a minimum of Rs 6,000 per month; the average salary of a municipal sweeper: Rs 16,000. Equally pitiable is the plight of university students. December-January is end- semester; time for exams. Studying with your lower limbs freezing is tough. But the university library is wonderfully warm. So students start queuing up for a seat at 5 am; the library opens at 7.30 am. The long queue extending up to the main gate on a bleak foggy morning is an impressive sight; Chinese students are committed, you think. But, grumble some of them, half the students in the queue are there only to book themselves a warm day. Those who really need to refer to books while studying in their dorms cant find a seat if they drop in at the library any time of the day. Sun, please This winter, the weather brought in a new law. Billboards obstructing the sunshine will no longer be allowed. Advertising agencies are furious; the Outdoor Advertising Association estimates that small agencies could lose up to 70 per cent of their hoardings. But residents are supportive. Interestingly, a Nanjing resident had actually sued and won compensation from an agency for obstructing the sunlight to his house with its billboard. Of course, more than residents rights, whats at play here is the prospect of foreigners descending in droves during the 2014 Youth Olympics to be hosted by Nanjing. Suddenly, heritage and history need to be protected. Thats why residential buildings arent the only ones slated to benefit; campuses, heritage buildings and bridges too qualify. Elsewhere, this is becoming a winter of discontent. The farmers agitation in the south over the sale of their land without their consent finally made news in the local media. CCTV showed the four farmers who were arrested talking to their families in jail, telling them how well they were being looked after. Officials have been briefing the press, showing them pictures of the body of the fifth arrested farmer who died in custody, of a heart attack, according to the officials. Two local party officials have been detained and interrogated as per party norms; the party chief, who had remained in his post for 40 years, has been asked to step down. A freeze has been put on using the land already sold to big companies; suitable compensation and even return of the land are being worked out. Posco agitationists back home should use China as an example of grassroots democracy at work."

Right near the tower,a few children are playing and tossing potatoes from a huge pile. A cow is chewing a mouthful and a few migratory birds are picking at the worms in the rotting vegetable.This was the scene alongside the highway days before farmers decided to throw their potatoes on the road on Tuesday and run tractors over them to have the government listen to their protest.Following this,the Deesa police station booked Bharatiya Kisan Sanghs Deesa taluka president Hiraji Mali and other farmers who took out the rally to destroy the potatoes on the road,for unlawful assembly and causing public nuisance.The ubiquitous potato now threatens to become a political issue. The farmers blame the government for not paying heed to the problem and giving them a raw deal,while the government suspects the cold storage managers hoarded the potatoes hoping to get a better profit and were now vacating their refrigerators for the new stock and provoking farmers to agitate.Agriculture Minister Dilip Sanghani said,The present agitation in Deesa is not led by the potato growing farmers but traders who kept the stock to keep the prices high for long. Now they want the government to buy all that wasted stock because they want to buy cheap new crop and store it for next season. It is malpractice which the government will not tolerate. Government will buy farmers production if situation demands.The state government has formed a high-level committee of Sanghani,Finance Minister Vajubhai Vala,Urban Development Minister Nitin Patel and Narottam Patel. The committee had held a meeting and ordered officials to take steps to maintain prices of potato.Magan Patel,president of Gujarat unit of Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) was,however,doubtful whether the government would act at all. The government has remained insulated from the plight of farmers and it is highly doubtful that it will take measures to solve the problem of potato growers, he said. The rally in Deesa (on Tuesday) was an outpour of angers among farmers. Elections are round the corner and if the government did not addressed their issues,they will turn against it, Patel added.The agitation was building up from early this month when potatoes began to appear on the roadside in Banaskantha and nobody was willing to own up the wastage. Somebody threw it here in the night so that municipality officials would not notice, said Amrut Desai,a clerk at the nearby agricultural produce marketing committee.Truckloads of potatoes lay abandoned on state highway-14 leading to Radhanpur in the west,and along river Banas,left to rot,days after the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh,Gujarat conducted a huge rally in Gandhinagar to knock on the governments door,on December 15.Farmers of Deesa,the taluka which accounts for 70 per cent of potato production in Gujarat,held back their produce in March-April anticipating higher prices at this time of the year.However,prices tanked instead. Farmers are not even able to recover cost of sorting and carting potatoes to markets and hence are dumping them anywhere in the open.At V J Patel Sub-Marketing Yard,Deesa,daily 500 to 700 bags,each containing 50 kg of potatoes,are traded at Rs 20 to 80. Around 25,000 farmers are engaged in potato cultivation in the state.Potato burial in GandhinagarAt Dehgam in Gandhinagar district,another major potato producing taluka in the state,farmers are burying potatoes in the ground.A bag of potatoes is fetching merely Rs 70 toRs 80. I have suffered losses of Rs 9 lakh, Arvind Patel,a potato grower of Nandol village in the taluka,said,adding he had not seen such a low market in his lifetime.Pinakin Vala,president of Dehgam Cold Storage Owners Association,said around 40 lakh bags of potatoes are still in cold storages.In my own cold storage,we still have 8,000 bags. We are burying 450 bags in ground by using earth movers every day, Vala,owner of Krishna Cold Storage in Samapa village of the taluka,said.Fresh potatoes are expected to start arriving from January 10 and I cannot imagine what will be the scenario then, said Sumeru Amin,chairman of Dehgam APMC. Dehgam produces 80 lakh bags of potatoes every year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The body of Rabin Barman was found hanging from a mango tree besides his home in Purba Magarmari village.Ramchandra Barman, the son of the farmer said that his father has been reeling under the impact of massive debts and he committed suicide after being unable to clear his dues. His father had kept a large amount of potatoes in the local cold storage hoping that he would sell it once he got higher prices for his produce.That was not to happen and Mr Barman took a loan of Rs. 50,000 from a bank for the cultivation of another crop of potatoes with the hope that once the price rose he would repay all his debts. He had taken the bank loan after offering the crop as security.Mr Barman had also taken nearly 20 acres on lease to cultivate next crop of potato but when the prices of the crop dipped further he committed suicide.There has been such a case and a police complaint has been lodged in this regard. But we are not sure whether he was a conventional farmer or not, said Smaraki Mahapatra, the District Magistrate."
355,No takers for old stocks,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/no-takers-for-old-stocks/,2011-12-22,Indian Express,"In a village,around 10 km south of Deesa,a farmer meandered in his potato farm,trying to smile to curtain worries crossing his mind.When I reaped my crop (in February),the prices of potatoes were Rs 125 per 20 kg. I did not sell my 770 bags back then expecting prices will be higher at this time of the year. My produce was of A-1 quality but I had dump them over the last four days since its prices in the market would not have covered even the transportation cost, said a farmer.Another farmer,who had come to meet the owner of the cold storage near the town,is seemingly worried as he said he would suffer a loss of around Rs 15 lakh. I have taken Rs 3 lakh crop loan and will have to find some way out to repay it, he said.Gujarat Cold Storage Association president Ganpat Kachhva said,As many as 15 lakh bags are still lying there in 74 cold storages of the taluka,and on an average,farmers are throwing away 60,000 bags every day. I am alone disposing of 700 bags daily, said Kachhva,who is also a farmer and owns a cold storage.The banks in the taluka have also been caught in the spiral. Sankar Rana,manager of a nationalised bank,said Rs 45 crore were due to the bank from farmers and cold storage owners in loan repayment and interest. We would consider postponing half the recovery to next year if farmers approached us, he said.Generally,prices of potato hover around Rs 300 to Rs 400 per bag. Deesa sends this vegetable to all the districts of the state and other states like Maharashtra,Rajasthan,Madhya Pradesh,Bangalore and Delhi. But this year,they have been undone by a bumper crop in Punjab and Agra where farmers grow and reap this crop at least three months early than their Gujarati counterparts.Market insiders said the trouble began in this north Gujarat district when prices of the commodity started sliding in October. By December,new potatoes from Agra and Punjab flooded Gujarat markets. In Ahmedabads Chimanbhai Jivabhai Patel Market Yard alone average seven to eight trucks of potato are arriving daily since early November,said sources in APMC.The new potatoes are selling at Rs 6 to Rs 8 per kg and traders are preferring them over the old stock. Following this,prices of the vegetable plummeted to Rs 1 per kg in Deesa APMC.Vinubhai Padhiar,president of Gujarart Batata Utpadak Khedut Sangathan Samiti,a body of potato growing farmers of the state,demanded that government should declare minimum support price (MSP) for the potatoes. We demand that government declare MSP for potato,give transport and export subsidies and a relief package of Rs 700 crore to farmers, he said.Deesa APMC chairmanGovabhai Rabari said they were helping farmers sell their produce directly to customers. We have deployed vehicles free of charge for farmers to help them sell their potatoes directly to customers at Rs 5 per kg, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
356,Food inflation at four-year low ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1111223/jsp/business/story_14917804.jsp,2011-12-23,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Dec. 22: Food inflation eased to a four-year low of 1.81 per cent for the week ended December 10 on the back of a fall in onion and potato prices, and a higher statistical base a year ago.The drop is merely a seasonal effect as vegetables are generally cheaper in winter. Further, prices had gone up to unreasonable levels in December last year creating a high base effect, analysts said.Food inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), stood at 4.35 per cent in the previous week and 13.22 per cent in the corresponding week of 2010.This is the lowest rate of food inflation since the week ended February 9, 2008, when it stood at 2.26 per cent.There is the strong base effect, on top of a normal monsoon and good harvest. I believe the moderate rate will continue for at least a month or two and we can expect its impact in the December headline inflation numbers also, Crisil chief economist D.K. Joshi said.According to data, onion became cheaper by 49.38 per cent year-on-year during the week under review, while potato prices were down 34.39 per cent. Prices of wheat also fell 4.21 per cent. Overall, vegetables became cheaper by 26.37 per cent.Some analysts said the trend in food prices was now firmly down and it would make it easier for the Reserve Bank to reverse its monetary policy and trim rates in response to decelerating economic growth."

Experts said that if the low numbers continue for some time it may help the RBI to go for interest rate cuts in its next monetary policy review on January 24."
358,Food inflation at 4-year low,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/food-inflation-at-4year-low/article2740057.ece,2011-12-23,The Hindu,"Food inflation fell sharply to an almost four-year low of 1.81 per cent during the week ended December 10, indicating an overall easing of prices. It stood at 4.35 per cent in the previous week. The fall was mainly due to decline in prices of essential commodities such as onion and potato.The continued dip in inflation will certainly embolden the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates when it reviews the monetary policy on January 24. The latest food inflation numbers are the lowest since the week ended February 9, 2008, when it stood at 2.26 per cent.According to official data released here on Thursday, onion became cheaper by 49.38 per cent year-on-year during the week under review, while potato prices were down by 34.39 per cent. Prices of wheat also fell by 4.21 per cent. Overall, vegetables became cheaper by 26.37 percent.Experts feel that moderation in food inflation numbers, which was in double-digit in early November, was on account of good kharif harvest as well as a high base. They felt that it was an ideal situation for a rate cut by the RBI.The RBI, in its mid-quarter review on December 16, had kept the key rates unchanged. While inflation in vegetables and wheat segments eased during the reporting week, prices of protein-rich items such as eggs, milk and pulses have continued to remain high.Pulses became costlier by 14.22 per cent, while milk was dearer by 11.19 per cent and eggs, meat and fish by 9.25 per cent.Inflation in the overall primary articles category stood at 3.78 per cent during the week ended December 10, as against 5.48 per cent in the previous week."

Even the statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr B R Ambedkar have been washed. There is no threat to public health now, Prakash Hadula,sub-divisional magistrate of Deesa,told The Indian Express.Deesa municipality officials said the cleaning drive went on for two days. We had started the work on Tuesday itself and the roads were cleaned by Thursday evening. Around 300 workers of Deesa Municipality and farmers with their tractors were engaged in the sanitation drive, said a municipality official.The farmers had dumped at least 25,000 bags (50 kg each) of potatoes on the main roads of the town during the rally to press for their demand that the state government buy their produce at higher prices. The tuber is selling at Re 1 to Rs 1.5 per kg,which,the farmers say,is not sufficient to even cover their transportation. Over 15 lakh bags are still stocked in 74 cold storages of Deesa.The potato growers had submitted a memorandum to the SDM after littering the roads,following which fears were raised that it may lead to outbreak of diseases. Farmers themselves understood their responsibility and later joined municipality workers in the cleaning drive, added the official.Vinubhai Padhiar,chairman of Gujarat Bataka Utpadak Khedut Sankalan Samiti,said there was no malafied intent behind farmers throwing potatoes on the roads. We had no intention of putting public health at risk. It was just a spontaneous outpour of anger among farmers. They did not want to cause inconvenience to the people, Padhair said.Reacting to state Agriculture Minister Dilip Sanghanis statement that the agitation was led by traders and not the farmers,Padhiar said if the minister had any doubt that potatoes were not of farmers,he should verify documents. If anybody in the government has any doubt that the potatoes now lying in cold storages do not belong to the farmers,they should visit Deesa and verify documents, he said.Cops seeks RTO help to catch tractor ownersThe Deesa police have sought help of the Banaskantha Regional Transport Office (RTO) to identify the tractor owners who took part in the rally during which farmers dumped potatoes on the city roads. We have sought help of RTO in Palanpur to get names of the owners of around 300 tractors that had littered roads with potatoes on Tuesday.

360,Inflation biggest challenge for RBI: D Subbarao,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Inflation-biggest-challenge-for-RBI-D-Subbarao/articleshow/11212980.cms,2011-12-23,The Times Of India,"VIJAYAWADA: Stating that effective management of inflation is the biggest challenge lying ahead of the Reserve Bank of India, bank chief Duvvuri Subbarao said that there is no meaning in achieving double digit growth rate when 80% of the population is still burdened by high prices.Speaking at a seminar organised by the Andhra Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( here on Thursday, Subbarao said that RBI was closely monitoring the markets and taking steps to put the economy on the rails. ""I am still hopeful of achieving a double digit growth rate at the end of this fiscal. However, I set the target only at 6% as the international markets are volatile and not giving any clue as to how they would take change,"" he said.Subbarao claimed that India has the capability of achieving 10% growth rate despite small hiccups. He said that it would be a great moment if the nation pulls off 10% growth rate soon.Referring to the repeated complaints from the industry, the apex bank chairman defended that increasing the interest rates was a compulsion when the inflation was going high.He said that the RBI was forced to hike the interest rates at least 13 times in the past two years, which helped the bank in bringing the inflation down to around 9%. ""Inflation would have been anywhere around 12-14% had we not raised the interest rates on the loans,"" he explained. He said that the growth rate would be considered good only when the nation's inflation was also in limits as rising inflation affects more than 80% of the people.""In fact, pensioners and small depositors have always been complaining about poor returns. How can we pay them better if not by raising the rates on industry?"" he asked.He, however, assured the industry captains that the RBI would look into rationalizing the rates after completely steadying the boat of inflation that is floating on the waters. He said that they wanted to reduce the inflation rate to around 7% by March end, which would help them taking some bold decisions.Refusing to divulge the strategies on managing the falling rupee value, Subbarao said that RBI was closely watching the situation. ""No central bank would like to disclose whether it really intervened in the markets to steady its currency or not. It would come to light only after two months,"" said Subbarao.He said foreign investors were adopting the wait and watch policy resulting in tough situation in the stock markets. ""This situation made the US dollar an attractive option for the investors (foreign) making the rupee weak,"" he told the gathering. He said that massive purchase of dollar in future markets was also complicating the markets.Earlier, he said that incomes of rural people too have increased considerably making them aspire for quality of food. He said that such a trend, though good, too had forced the inflation to go high. He said that people from all areas were spending a lot on expensive food and valuables.He added that people need not take the depreciation of rupee value as damage to their self-dignity. ""Prices of potato go up and come down. Similarly, rupee value too,"" he observed."

It stood at 13.22% in the same year-ago period. Food inflation had touched 2.26% in the week to February 9, 2008.""The persistent high inflation for some time now is unacceptable. We have to steer the economy back to the path of fiscal consolidation,"" prime minister Manmohan Singh told the meeting of his Council on Trade and Industry. ""While purchasing power has gone up, the supply side response has so far been muted. We believe that with the policy focus on improving agricultural production and productivity, our economy will soon be able to step up the production of food articles, thereby controlling inflation in these products,"" he said.The latest data showed vegetable prices fell 26.37% year-on-year while potato prices were down 34.39%. Onion prices, which had shot sharply last year, fell an annual 49.38% while wheat prices were down 4.21%. Prices of fruits, eggs, meat and fish eased from the previous week but remained firm.Experts said arrival of fresh supplies had helped calm prices. The index for food articles group declined by 0.5% to 191.0 from 191.9 for the previous week due to lower prices of fruits and vegetables and condiments and spices (2% each) and ragi, tea and rice (1% each). But prices of jowar, gram and masur (2% each) and river fish, poultry chicken and sea fish (1% each) moved up.Stubbornly high food inflation has remained a huge policy challenge for the UPA government for the past few years and has contributed to higher overall inflation. RBI has raised interest rates 13 times since March 2010 to tame price pressures. Policymakers have been wrong-footed several times while predicting the trend of food prices."

The city has grown up along with its bread. The story of bread is the story of the citys cosmopolitan past and its current globalised palate. No other place in India loves its bread as much as Calcutta does, not even Goa, claims Niranjan Murthy, chef and chief operating officer of Kookie Jar. Support arrives from chef Sayak Chakroborty of the Park Hotels Calcutta: Our international guests often tell me they think the breads in Calcutta and Goa are the best in the country. It all began with the Portuguese in both Goa and Bengal, in the sixteenth century. The loaf of bread came with the Portuguese, Dutch and the French. To be specific, it was the gift of the Portuguese, says food critic and enthusiast Rajen Bali. The Portuguese term for bread is pao, from which the Bengali babu got his pauruti, says Bali. Some believe the term derives from the fact that dough is kneaded by feet (pa). The word comes from the Portuguese pao or the north Indian pao, a term for a quarter of a pound, says chef Sayak. Since bread was available in quarters of a pound, it became popular as pao-roti. When bread first came to the city from bakeries dotting the small settlements along the Hooghly  Bandel, Chinsurah, Chandernagore and Serampore  it was more or less restricted to domestic consumption within the European communities. Then began its journey to the andarmahal, where it now reigns supreme. The first instance of organised bread-making in Calcutta was at the Great Eastern Hotel by David Wilson, an Englishman who initially ran a confectionery near Cossitola, now Bentinck Street. In 1840 Wilson opened the Auckland Hotel, which went on to become the Great Eastern Hotel. He started baking breads that became an instant hit with the guests. Even then, bread was an elite European affair, not meant for the Bengali bhadrolok. It was popularised after an Italian took it up. Federico Peliti, an Italian, came to India in 1868 as a caterer to the Viceroy, the Earl of Mayo. He opened a hotel in Calcutta  the Pelitis restaurant. During the 1890s, the Pelitis became a Mecca of eating. Bread was an important part of the menu. Pelitis assistant Angelo Firpo opened Firpos on Chowringhee that later became a landmark on the citys culinary map. So phenomenal was Firpos popularity that during the late Sixties, a Calcuttan of a certain class was expected to do certain things  visit the Victoria Memorial grounds with a loved one and collect leftover bread from the Firpos at night. The story of bread in Calcutta would be incomplete without the Jewish contribution. Nahoums confectionery, founded in 1902, which moved to its present location in the New Market in 1916, holds a special place in the city. It is the oldest running bakery in town, says Bali. Flurys was launched in 1927 and introduced Swiss breads and delicacies. Then there was Greek bread that usually came in thick chunks and had to be dipped in soup or had with cheese. Greek breads were made by George Papadolous at Attikon Bakery on Free School Street. It was operational till the 80s. German bread, especially of Wyse & Co, was a competitor to Nahoums. Another competitor was the MX DGama or Maxos, as it was popularly known. The Chinese community came with their bao. Its a bread that is steamed, instead of baked. It is made from flour and stuffed with pork or chicken keema and can be had fresh at Tiretta Bazar at the crack of dawn on weekends. At these institutional bakeries, the fineness of the bread was more important than variety. The British church introduced bread to the neo-converts. As a spiritual symbol, bread has accompanied religious festivals and rites: the Lords Prayer asks for our daily bread. As Europeans were opening up eateries across town in the 19th century and catering mainly to the Anglo-Indian community that needed their bread at every meal, the Nawabs men did the rest. Many Muslim bawarchis (chefs), who had seen a downslide in their trade as the glory of the nawabs faded, came to Calcutta and took their popular woodfire bread to households. Thats how the Bengali babu learnt eating his bread and offered a large market for the regular loaf. Bengalis also loved to travel and sample various types of food. They increasingly were keen to try new varieties of bread, says Murthy of Kookie Jar. After a point there was no stopping the bread from invading the Bengali kitchen. By 1923, the year Abol Tabol was published, Sukumar Ray had already written: Kintu shobar chaite bhalo/pauruti aar jhola gur (But the best dish of them all/ Is bread and flowing jaggery). Now there is a new feast. Bread-making is not restricted to a handful of bakeries across the city; the search for variety and increasing demand for different foods have led to the entry of multiple players. The humble pauruti has come a long way in the city  from deem toasts, grilled sandwiches and the Bengalis favourite butter-cheeni toasts to exotic varieties like the pretzel, pumpernickel or a baguette, to name a few. Christmas breads do not mean just hot-cross buns or fruit loaves anymore. Now, the city can choose from its panforte, pandolce, pandoro, panpepato, panettone or pangiallo (Italian breads with different flavours) to begin with, chuckles chef Sayak. The price of breads at Flurys varies from Rs 25 for our basic white bread to up to Rs 95 for our speciality fruit zopf (typically served for Sunday breakfasts) or Russian Pumpernickel (a dark, moist and chewy bread), says Flurys executive chef Vikas. At Spencers Patisserie, on offer are cheese and garlic bread, farmers bread, potato rosemary, fruit zopf, focaccia, French baguette and salsa picante. Kookie Jar specialises in over 10 varieties of bread including milk, multi-grained, spicy-masala, cheese, sun-dried tomato, spinach and ricotta, and garlic bread. Besides the regular bread, Deli of The Conclave and the two Afraa Delis  in City Centre Salt Lake and New Town  offer focaccia, bagel, baguettte, sesame semolina, ciabatta, sour dough, fougasse, challa, poppy seed bloomer and Irish soda breads. The younger generation seems to prefer a low-calorie, fibre-rich, fancy diet. Keeping their taste in mind, the city bakeries are working on varieties like the brown and multi-grain breads that are now available at the grocers next door. Bread has also moved on from the hand-made variety. Now an entire range of equipment  rotary bread oven, walk-in proofer, dough kneader, planetary mixer, spiral mixer, automatic cookie machine and others  are at service for mass production. Some of the local bread companies that have stood the test of time and still produce good breads are Anchor, Prince and Modern bakeries. Some bakeries stick to their traditional hand-to-mouth method. One such is that of the Saldanhas. Eighty years old, the little bakery at 19 Nawab Abdul Rehman Street off Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road is run by Denzil and Mona Saldanha and their daughter Deborah. The place exudes an old-world charm as one finds the way through a narrow alley. A large iron gate leads you to the base factory. Every loaf is handmade here and has no added chemicals. They perish after two days. The bread baking starts at five in the evening. The family wakes up at 5.30am for the slicing and packaging. Our breads go to a fixed clientele. In the last five years I have seen even the poor switching over to bread from their traditional sattu and muri meals. Easy availability and affordability are the game-changers, says Denzil. Bread has come a long way in the city. But the definition of the best bread remains unchanged. Spongy, warm and melt-in-the mouth. It doesnt crumble; neither does it turn into hard cardboard when toasted. The aroma makes you contemplative. Thats what a piece of loaf means to me, says Bali.

They do not have time to either listen to or seek solution to farmers problems. JD(S) gains power by chanting farmers. But the party members remember farmers only during elections.Farmers have stopped growing potatoes due to untold miseries. Now it is the turn of ginger growers. But what action has JD(S), which has the highest number of MLAs in the district, taken? It needs only the votes of farmers, but is not ready to share their burden or fight for their rights.Krishna said former minister H C Srikantiah established Hemavathi Sugar Factory to help farmers.But the JD(S) leaders took it into their control and caused a loss of Rs 60 crore, thus making it fall into the hands of private persons. MP of the region H D Devegowda has not raised the issue of farmers not even once in the Parliament, but now he wants the government to convene a special session to discuss the problems of farmers, he added.Foreign investment in agriculture would actually help farmers in a big way. But the BJP and the JD(S) oppose it to safeguard the interest of middlemen. The BJP exhibits double standards. It opposes foreign investment in agriculture at the Centre, but conducts a convention to attract investment in the state, Krishna said.Most corrupt stateMLA Dinesh Gundurao said the credit of converting the once model state of Karnataka into a most corrupt state in the state should go to the BJP.The JD(S) is not far behind, it does not have any principles. They are ready to have a truck with any party at any time for power and money.The credit of selling even Vidhana Parishat and Rajya Sabha tickets should go to the JD(S).

In wholesale the price range of green vegetables is Rs 3 to Rs 15 per kilogram which is very low. In coming days, if the weather remains good, the rates might come down further.""The price of potato has come down from Rs 10 to Rs 4 per kilogram and winter's favourite vegetable, carrot, has got cheaper by Rs 20 a kg.

Food inflation stood at 1.81 per cent in the previous week.Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee expressed confidence that overall inflation would come down to around 6 per cent if the declining trend continues.If this trend continues, then you will have year-end inflation (WPI) around 6 per cent (plus/minus). But it cannot be lower than 6 per cent, because inflationary pressure was higher in the weeks before, he told reporters.Government data released on Thursday showed onion prices declining by almost 60 per cent, while potatoes grew cheaper by close to 34 per cent.

Primary articles have over 20 per cent weight in the wholesale price index.The sharp decline in food inflation in the past months have been seen due to the seasonal factors and a large base effect that was seen during this time last year. Food inflation hovered 18-19 per cent around this time last year.Supply woesAnalysts said food inflation persisted largely due to supply-side problems. Since the government has taken steps on correcting the supply crunch, it has come down. The headline inflation, however, has not come down significantly. The headline inflation persisted above 9 per cent for most part of the year, prompting the RBI to go in for tightening of key short-term policy rates for as many as 13 times.The RBI, however, decided to hold the key policy rates steady at its Decemeber 16 review meeting, which indicated that its focus has now shifted from inflation to economic growth, which decelerated to 6.9 per cent in the July-September period, the slowest in more than two years.Economists are also of the view that the RBI may now start reversing rates, once inflation comes near comfort level.Manufactured inflation, which forms over 65 per cent of the WPI basket, is hovering around 8 per cent.Inflation in the overall primary articles category stood at 2.70 per cent during the week ended December 17, as against 3.78 per cent in the previous week.Inflation in the non-food segment, which includes fibres and oilseeds, was recorded at 0.28 per cent during the week under review, as against 1.37 per cent in the week ended December 3.Fuel and power inflation stood at 14.37 per cent during the week ended December 17, as against 15.24 per cent in the previous week.Headline inflation, which factors in manufactured items, besides food and fuel, has been above 9 per cent-mark since December last year.

Overall inflation in November stood at 9.11%.

Wheat prices fell an annual 3.30% in the week to December 17.The index for food articles group declined by 0.4% to 190.3 from 191.0 for the previous week due to lower prices of fruits and vegetables (4%), jowar (3%), tea and arhar (2% each) and ragi, urad and condiments and spices (1% each). But prices of sea fish (7%), chicken (2%) and moong, masur, maize, river fish bajra (1% each) moved up.Experts attributed the fall to a good kharif harvest as well as a high base. ""This is a base affect and the good kharif harvest has also contributed to moderation. We expect the prices to remain low for the next few weeks and this may help the RBI to go for rate cuts in the near future,"" Crisil chief economist D K Joshi said.But prices of milk, eggs, meat and fish remained robust due to sustained demand for these products. Increasing demand for protein-based items due to higher incomes have pushed up prices."

The organisations have also appealed to the farmers to vote as a community and not on caste and communal lines, so that political parties are forced to implement the promises related to farmers' welfare and agriculture that they make during the elections but forget afterwards.While releasing a 12-point list of demand for development of agriculture, Kisan Jagriti Manch president Sudhir Panwar said, ""Almost all political parties have ditched farmers in the state in the last two decades. They make promises but after coming to power, they give benefit to industrialists and middlemen. At the same time, farmers will have to realise that their vote will only count when they will vote as a community.""Yashpal Singh, a farmer associated with Bhartiya Kisan Union, said, ""Caste and communal combinations can provide a foothold to the parties but the floating vote will make the difference and this comprises farmers who have been badly hit by the shortage and black-marketing of the fertilisers, losses due to potato glut, poor crop procurement forcing them to sell their produce at a loss and increasing input cost due to increase in inflation.""Nearly 70% of the UP's 19.95 crore population lives in villages and out of it, 80% is dependent on agriculture and allied sectors. To be precise, nearly 10 crore of the population is directly engaged in cultivation. Nearly 60% of the total 2.41 lakh square kilometre area of UP is agricultural land. However, 90% farmers come in the small or marginal category which means having less than four acres of land. Their average monthly income is Rs 2,000.This, when UP has been rated as the best performing state in agriculture in the country. The state tops in production of wheat and sugarcane in the country. In fact, UP contributes around 22% to the total national production of foodgrains, vegetables, fruits and milk and 40% to the total production of potato and sugarcane. However, farmers do not get their due because of the stranglehold of middlemen on the mandis.Farmers also pointed out that successive governments have acquired agricultural land at low prices for the development of infrastructure, power plants and urbanisation and sold them at high prices to the builders and corporates. The farmer never gets the benefit of the development. The resentment among farmers could be gauged from the fact that six farmers lost their lives in last two years in clashes with police over land acquisition."

While the statistics showed the rate of increase in food prices had slowed to a new low of 0.42%, street prices of common fruits and vegetables painted a different picture. Only the wholesale prices of potatoes and onions were in sync with official data.The index shows that prices of vegetables as a category fell 36.02%, a claim belied by neighbourhood greengrocers. ""People expect seasonal vegetables to become cheaper in winter. However, prices have only moved up in the last month. Methi is Rs 25-30 per kg while capsicum is Rs 45 per kg.

Its retail price is Rs 20-25 per kg. Potatoes are down from Rs 7 per kg to Rs 3 per kg, and are retailing for Rs 10-15 per kg.Aditi Sood, a housewife from central Delhi, said her vegetable shopping trip to Sarojini Nagar on Thursday lightened her purse by close to Rs 1,000. ""I normally shop for a week at one go and Sarojini has good quality vegetables. However, there is a price to pay for it. Other than the basic aloo-pyaz, nothing costs less than Rs 20. Lady's finger is Rs 60 per kg while cauliflower costs Rs 30. If you start buying things like babycorn and broccoli, the expense shoots up. Who says inflation is down? Figures don't reflect what the common man is being put through,"" she said.Wholesale market officials also accepted that there was a rise in prices at the mandi due to supply variation but blamed the current prices on retail malpractices.

The slide in food inflation, which recorded a low of 1.81 per cent in the preceding week, was also helped by the improved supplies of essential items such as vegetables. The data bolstered hopes of a steady easing in overall price pressures that would let the central bank focus on stimulating growth. With food inflation declining well below one per cent, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said the overall inflation would drop to 6 per cent by March end. If this trend continues you will have (fiscal) year-end (headline) inflation around 6 per cent ...

Prices of wheat also fell 3.30 per cent, while vegetables became cheaper by 36.02 per cent. Experts attributed the fall to a good kharif harvest as well as a high base. This is a base affect. The good kharif harvest has also contributed to moderation. We expect the prices to remain low for the next few weeks and this may help the RBI to go for rate cuts in the near future, said D.K. Joshi, chief economist at Crisil. Despite the sharp drop in the annual food inflation rate, pulses recorded close to 15 per cent annual inflation, while milk and poultry products recorded over 11 per cent inflation during the latest reported week. Fruits, too, registered high inflation. Stubbornly high food inflation has remained a huge policy challenge for the government for the past few years and has contributed to a higher overall inflation. The RBI has raised interest rates 13 times since March 2010 to tame price pressures. However, despite several interest-rate increases, overall price pressures had shown little sign of easing."
