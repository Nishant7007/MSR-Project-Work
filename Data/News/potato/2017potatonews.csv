File photo: C. VenkatachalapathyWith the start of a new year, affordable prices are something that many consumers would look for. For a week now, mixed prices are prevailing in the vegetable markets, as traders say that the price of few vegetables have shot up, while the cost of a few have dropped, and these rates are here to stay for at least another week.The last week of 2016 saw the price of some vegetables such as onions, beans and broad beans (avarakkai) shoot up due to various reasons, according to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The rates of beans and avarakkai have increased in the last two days. This is primarily because the quality of vegetables is good but the supply is less. Many consumers are purchasing the two vegetables and this has hiked the prices. These vegetables are supplied from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, he said.From costing Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 earlier, the rate of one kilo of beans has doubled toRs. 30 now, while the price of avarakkai has gone up from Rs. 15 to Rs. 25.All is not well with onions too. Mr. Balu said the onions supplied from Andhra Pradesh that were of medium size and even smaller used to be sold for Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 in Vellore.Now, the supply from AP has stopped, and onions from parts of Maharashtra such as Pune and Ahmednagar have started to arrive. Those procuring the stock have to pay Rs. 5 per kilo on commission and toll. So, onions are sold at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 to fetch profit, he said.He added that it would take at least a week for the price of onions supplied from Maharashtra to stabilise.Drumsticks rate has also gone up as the mist affected flowering and yield. It was sold for Rs. 80.The rate of peas, which are usually priced high, could come as a surprise. The price dropped from Rs. 80 to Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 last week, he said.While small onions (a kilo) costs Rs. 20, tomatoes are priced at Rs. 5 to Rs. 8. Potatoes cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 14, while ladys finger is priced at Rs. 25 to Rs. 30. The local thorny variety of brinjal is priced at Rs. 30 a kilo, while carrot is sold for Rs. 10.The rates of other vegetables are  cabbage  Rs. 6 to Rs. 8, ginger  Rs. 20 to Rs. 40, snake gourd  Rs. 12, bitter gourd  Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, pumpkin  Rs. 10, green chillies  Rs. 20 to Rs. 30, and coriander (a bunch)  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30.Coconut was sold for Rs. 5 to Rs. 8 (local), while those from Pollachi cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 20.The same rates will continue for a week, Mr. Balu said."

The village has a population of 320 people and they are dependent only on agriculture.Villagers complain that in the past one decade or so, attacks by monkeys and wild boars in their agriculture land have made things difficult.

He, however, is clueless on providing solutions to farmers who were not growing millets owing to threat from wild animals.Due to growing population of monkeys, acres of arable land left untilled and agriculture activities have almost reduced to vicinity of houses in the villages.Villagers in Thano in the outskirts of Dehradun are trying to grow crops such as ginger, turmeric, bitter gourd and lady finger that usually monkeys dont eat.People in Balori village that falls in Pauri district have passed a resolution asking the district administration to either drive away monkeys or vasectomise them.The forest department is entrusted with the task of catching monkeys but it is confined to urban areas. In February 2016, the department gave permission with riders to kill the wild boars affecting farming in hills.Killing wild boars is not an easy task. In the absence of trained hunters, the order is meaningless said Ratan Aswal of village Mirchoda."
2,"In This Maharashtra Village, Parents Migrate for a Living, Children Die",http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-this-maharashtra-village-parents-migrate-for-a-living-children-die/story-csNQgANn8n2g3NOmC3wecJ.html,2017-01-05,Hindustan Times,"As Soni Wadwi breastfed her one-year-old son, Sonu, outside her hut in Khoch village, Palghar district of Maharashtra in western India, she recounted how he almost died from severe malnutrition four months ago.The family left the village last year for work for several months as many do. When they returned, Sonu was weak and admitted to a hospital.Wadwis son survived and made a full recovery but about 400 other children died from malnutrition-linked illnesses in Palghar between April and November 2016 -- a rising trend that campaigners put down to an annual pattern of migration for work.In the last three years, malnutrition has claimed the lives of about 1,600 children in Palghar, a tribal region battling high unemployment and poverty, with national headlines over child deaths prompting government action to address the problem.Read: Maharashtra tribals dont eat wheat, barter it for salt, oil, says studyKhoch lies 150 km from Indias commercial capital Mumbai and close to the border with Gujarat, one of the countrys most prosperous states, but unemployment is forcing parents to move to cities to find work to feed their children.Palghars problem of malnutrition is shocking because of its proximity to Mumbai, but it is migration to Mumbai that is at the root of this problem, said Milind Thatte, founder of Vayam, a movement for tribal development.People from Palghar migrate to Mumbai for work, but the cost of living there is very high. They dont eat to save money.Villagers start leaving Palghar in December for the Mumbai satellite towns of Thane and Bhiwandi where they often work 12-hour shifts at construction sites or road building projects.Once the monsoon season halts construction, workers return to villages in July for a jobless spell until October, when the start of the harvest provides daily work on farmland.Locals refer to September as starvation month, when many people are unemployed and childrens deaths peak.The end of the harvest in December again signals the end of the villagers home stay.We have no work now, but we will leave soon. We are waiting for the seth (the construction site contractor) to come and take us, Wadwi said.BOTTOM OF THE LADDERNamdev Savara, a member of the Kathkari tribe, has devoted an entire wall of his one-room hut in Khoch to colourful depictions of Indian gods and goddesses.So when his son, Ishwar - which means the supreme lord in Hindi - died in September, he hung a black and white picture of the child on this wall of worship.Savara said he will not leave Khoch in 2017 and he will work on a local road construction project with his wife. The couple will stay close to their two other children who go to school.According to government data about 39% of Indian children suffer from chronic undernutrition and around 42.5% are underweight.In Palghar, malnutrition most affects the Kathkari tribe -- a one time forest community which is among the lowest in the pecking order of the Indian caste system.Most children who died this year due to malnutrition-linked illnesses were from the Kathkari community, said Nidhi Chaudhari, who heads the Palghar local government office.Vivek Pandit, an activist who has represented the area in the Maharashtra state assembly, said Kathkari people dont have land and are handpicked for their ability to do strenuous work.They work at construction sites, break stones for road construction or at brick kilns, Pandit said.Employers usually prefer to hire Kathkari couples as they coordinate better and are cheaper than two men, with men paid around 200 rupees daily and women anywhere between 50 and 100 rupees.The migrant workers survive on rice and the occasional dish of potato and onions, saving their money for the jobless months.WEAK AND VULNERABLEDoctors said children suffer due to irregular feeding patterns when both parents work long hours.The parents priority is not their childs health but to earn their daily wages, said Ramdas Marad, superintendent at the Palghar sub-district hospital that runs at twice its capacity in the monsoon months between June and September.Children are more vulnerable to disease such as pneumonia or respiratory infections during this time as they are weak and their immunities are compromised.The government is drawing up a list of Kathkari tribe members to ensure they benefit from the government schemes for jobs and education, among the others that they are eligible for.The government has even started a new road project in Khoch to attempt to slow migration, but only a handful of people who have bank accounts are so far eligible.Savara is among them but his decision to stay in Khoch this year is an anomaly in the village where migration began last month.Many, such as Wadwi, even committed to leave in September, when a contractor visited families and bought promises of migration against an advance payment.I know my child was malnourished when we migrated last year. But what will I feed him if I dont work? she said."
3,Demonetisation protest: Farmers throw vegetables on road,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/demonetisation-protest-farmers-throw-vegetables-on-road/,2017-01-06,Indian Express,"Farmers protest at Samrala in Ludhiana on Friday. Gurmeet Singh Farmers protest at Samrala in Ludhiana on Friday. Gurmeet SinghHUNDREDS OF farmers gathered at the main chowk in the Samrala area of Ludhiana on Friday and threw vegetables, milk, eggs on the main road saying they had no choice but to throw away their produce as demonetisation had caused them losses.The farmers had come under the banner of Bharti Kisan Union (Rajewal) and they stated that in the upcoming polls, they would ask each candidate his stand on ending the demonetisation woes of farmers.Balbir Singh Rajewal, union president, said: BJP is going gaga over Chandigarh polls where poll percentage was nearly 51 per cent and hence angry people did not even vote. This time, I urge farmers to press the NOTA button and reject all parties as demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes has not ended our woes even at the end of the PMs 50-day deadline.Joginder Singh, a farmer from Seh village, said, We are getting Rs 1 per kg price for cauliflower while Rs 4-5 a kg each for peas and carrots. Potatoes are being sold at Rs 2 a kg by us at mandis and in the evening, we give our animals the stock left to eat as this is the only option left with us. Our expenditure is more than double and income is bare minimum.Rajewal added, Our farmers have not got pending payments of milk supply for the past two months. As milk co-operatives are giving a lumpsum cheque to societies and they are not able to give the cash amount to all the supplier farmers. So, they have no choice but to throw milk on the roads.Similar is the condition with payment of eggs. Prices of eggs have also crashed drastically in the market. Poultry farmers thus stated that they were incurring losses while the government was making tall claims over cashless society.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

5,Miffed  Mamata Banerjee calls for Narendra Modi-less national government,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/miffed-mamata-banerjee-calls-for-modi-less-national-government/articleshow/56385351.cms,2017-01-07,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee again asked for a national government with some other BJP leader at the helm, citing revenue and job loss in all the states after Narendra Modi 's demonetisation move.While taking stock of the departments at Town Hall, she said: ""Our state suffered a Rs 5,500-crore revenue loss. A total of 1.70 crore people have been hit hard, with 81.5 lakh losing their jobs. The Prime Minister can't run the country. Let there be a national government and let someone else from BJP take over. It can be Advani, Rajnath Singh or Arun Jaitley .""Appreciating what President Pranab Mukherjee said about providing protection to the poor, the CM urged him to become a saviour for the states.""The present PM is the great Kalidas who is cutting branches of the tree on which he is. The country isn't in safe hands of `buddhiharan babu' (a fool).Even government projects have been hit. I ask SDOs to get in touch with the CMO in the event of a government project being stalled,"" the CM said, asking officials to create a dedicated CMO phone number for this.Mamata feared that worse is in store for the state. ""What you are seeing now isn't the bottom of the crisis.The worst is yet to happen. How long can industries operate without funds? They are running out of working capital. People have money in banks, but they can't withdraw it. We don't know how long the cashless PM will continue with the cash withdrawal ceiling. Farmers, bidi workers, tea plantation workers, those working in jute mills, artisans, weavers and jewellery makers are the worst hit. The Centre had promised Rs 2,500 crore to cooperative banks. But they have got only Rs 300 crore. The cash crunch has taken a toll on rabi crops and potato farming too."" She argued that the slump in farming will lead to aspike in commodity prices in the near future and the country will be heading towards famine.The CM also hit out at Modi over his bid to do away with the old institutions. ""Yesterday , we got a letter from the ministry of corporate affairs dissolving the board for industrial and financial reconstruction (BIFR). This is not the only one. Soon after he came to power, the PM abolished the planning commission, which used to allocate resources for states. He replaced it with Niti Ayog. The PM has been eroding institutions that formed the country's backbone,"" the CM said.The CM took a dig at the deployment of CRPF jawans in front of the state BJP office. ""Political parties are calling in the CRPF when there is a state government. The PM is misusing government agencies. The country is witnessing a terror, we have to come out of it."" She then appealed to all political parties to set aside their differences and chalk out a common minimum programme for the national government."
6,Hope a failed harvest for farmers as cash runs dry,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hope-a-failed-harvest-for-farmers-as-cash-runs-dry/articleshow/56385254.cms,2017-01-07,The Times Of India,"Sale of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides fell 40% post demonetisation 02:01More than 50 days after demonetisation , farming remains hit by the twin blow of a continuing cash crunch , which is making crop inputs such as fertilizers difficult to procure, and rockbottom prices of produce.TOI travelled across a 400km slice of south-western Uttar Pradesh flanking the Yamuna and found farmers simmering with anger at the damage caused by the move.Cash shortage had led to vegetable prices crashing, delayed wheat sowing and inadequate inputs for winter crops as well as a fall in wages.Among the more marginalised sections such as small farmers, brick kiln workers, small vendors, construction and casual labourers, the effects were magnified and severe.Post December 30  the cut-off date announced by the PM for a transition to better days  the situation doesn't appear to have changed much.Queues continue at many village banks, stoking worry among farmers for their winter crops. This ground reality appears to contradict the optimism expressed by the finance minister that increased sowing this year was an indicator of farmers' ""support"" for demonetisation.In Aligarh, Mathura and Agra, normal wheat sowing is done in the first fortnight of November. Because of the sudden note ban , it was delayed by 15-20 days, said farmers at Managarhi village in Mathura district. ""We used stored grain for sowing since there was no cash for buying. Other expenses are pending. Now the worry is, how to water this crop and arrange for fertilisers?"" said Raj Kumar, who has sown about five acres.The same worry haunts farmers in Etawah and Auraiya, although their normal sowing time is in the first week of December. Sadan Kumar from Ekghara village in Etawah has also used stored grain as seed and plans to use less fertilizer. Irrigation is a bigger concern because mostly pumps are used and this requires cash for diesel. For those who don't own a pumpset, buying water is a major expense at Rs 4,500 per acre, said Kundan Singh in Mathura.That the rabi crop is not getting required inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides or fungicides is confirmed by traders. Sanjeev Yadav in Saifai and Ram Khilona Mishra in Bakewar are vendors of agri inputs. They told TOI that ""sales were down 30- 40%"" despite them offering some credit facilities.From Mathura in the west to Auraiya in central UP, growers of cauliflower, brinjal, potato, chillies, tomatoes, etc told TOI that vegetables sold for one fourth to one tenth of expected prices after note ban.""We have never seen such a time,"" said 80-year old Saudan Singh from Mitholi village in Mathura who sold his brinjal harvest for just 80p per kg and tomatoes for Rs 3 per kg in November.In Ankodia village in Etawah, Anoop Kumar said that cauliflower went for just Rs 5 per kg while potatoes dropped to Rs 2-3 per kg. While the kharif harvest of paddy and pulses like arhar was sold for lower prices in mandis, transactions were mostly done in the old notes till December end.As long as petrol pumps were allowed to accept the old notes, farmers would use payments from wholesale traders to buy diesel, said a trader in Etawah.But across the Chambal river near Etawah, in Bhind, MP, where the main crops are less water-requiring bajra, moong, urad and til, the mandi wears a haunted look as farmers are not selling their produce because they don't want to be paid in cheques. E-transactions are virtually absent.Says Akhtar Khan of Khanpur village in Auraiya, ""I haven't sown my four bighas. It is located near a forest area and requires a lot of care. Where will Iget the cash for all that?"""

Some have even approached us to supply maize in bulk.""Bangarmau has half a dozen big flour and maize mills, a dozen rice mills, large cold storage for potatoes and numerous mandis for green vegetables and fruit. The launch of the expressway in November facilitated farmers, mill and mandi owners significantly as they are able to transport their produce to man dis of Gorakhpur, Delhi and Lucknow in almost half the time it used to take earlier.Mandi owner Jameel Ahmad said, ""Once the eway is opened for trucks, we would be able to supply potatoes and muskmelon in bulk to Lucknow in less than two hours. Even supply to Mahewa mandi of Gorakhpur, which took six hours, will now take only four hours.""Shopkeepers said the expressway can help them reach more markets in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab as now they are directly connected to Agra. Maize mill owner Sanjeev Kumar said, ""Earlier, the trucks took two days to reach Delhi as they had to halt at Agra after travelling from Bangarmau for one full night.They reached Delhi after another night's journey but now they will reach in only a day as they will join the Yamuna Expressway from Agra. Freight charges have reduced to almost half to benefit entrepreneurs as well as farmers.""The e-way has also solved the problem of transporting perishable commodities on time as trucks carrying fruit and vegetables to mandis of other cities will reach in almost half the time. Singh added that UP government has proposed many cold storage for potatoes along the e-way like in Kannauj and Safipur. This will help farmers sell potatoes at profitable rates and prevent rotting.There is a big demand in Delhi and Haryana."""
8,Lalu's seat barb at Modi,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170111/jsp/bihar/story_129582.jsp,2017-01-11,Telegraph,"Patna, Jan. 10: RJD chief Lalu Prasad today said he was not invited to share the dais at Prakash Utsav with Narendra Modi because ""the Prime Minister was afraid I would raise the issue of demonetisation and request him to choose a square of his liking where people could punish him"". On November 13 last year, Modi had urged the people to give him 50 days to implement the note ban and said if after that they found shortcomings in his work they could punish him at a public square. At the Prakash Utsav event in Gandhi Maidan on January 5, Lalu's absence from the dais had set tongues wagging. ""I was happy to sit cross-legged for two-and-a-half hours along with devotees,"" Lalu said today at a news meet where he tore into the Centre over demonetisation. "" Ekdam tanatan hain, (I'm fit as a fiddle),"" Lalu said he had told Modi when the Prime Minister had enquired about his health. He said Modi's praise for prohibition was a red herring. ""Nitish has been demanding prohibition in the entire country, but Modi cleverly avoided committing on it. His praise for prohibition was to hide the failure of demonetisation and deflect public attention from it,"" Lalu said. He said the country was reeling from the note ban shock, with GDP growth rate plunging and the unorganised sector virtually destroyed, impacting around 40 crore workers and common people. ""Farmers across the nation are facing devastation. They have to sell potato and cauliflower at just Rs 2-3 per kilo,"" he said. Aboout BJP president Amit Shah's visit to Patna Sahib today, Lalu said: ""He has come late. Yet he should pray to Guru Gobind for forgiveness for implementing demonetisation in the country."" He also challenged Modi to declare how much black money the government has recovered after demonetisation. Peppered with questions about the bonhomie between the JDU and the BJP (read Nitish and Modi), Lalu flicked them away by saying ""it is a good thing"" and that the BJP should support the government in developmental works instead of mudslinging. Lalu also revealed that he had called up Akhilesh Yadav last evening and told the Uttar Pradesh chief minister: ""Enough is enough; you should meet your father (Mulayam Singh Yadav) to stop all this (the infighting). Akhilesh asserted that he was still with his father and had asked for just three months to officiate as Samajwadi Party (SP) president."" Lalu said he would call Mulayam tonight, and that SP leader Amar Singh ""should make efforts to bring Mulayam and Akhilesh together""."
9,Farmers on expressway to crorepati club,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/farmers-on-expressway-to-crorepati-club/articleshow/56464744.cms,2017-01-11,The Times Of India,"A brick and mortar house now stands tall in place of the decrepit mud hut with a thatched roof at local farmer Jaiveer's house in Hinmapur village of Kannauj. The roof that once reeked of moisture and rain, is replaced now with an open cemented terrace that housed the marriage party of his daughter a few months ago. It was a distant dream for the family not very long which came true, thanks to Agra-Lucknow Expressway.When the government acquired around 12 bighas of Jaiveer's land what he and his family got in return was close to Rs 3 crore, and the tag of becoming a crorepati farmer in the small village. And, with money, came not just the house and the marriage, but also a tractor, two motorbikes, a car, a potato trading unit in Kanpur and land bought in another part of the district, all adding to the family's assets. It's, however, not just Jaiveer, but other farmers like Raghuvir and Pyaare Lal who have all earned the distinction of becoming millionaires because of the compensation that the expressway has brought""Pehle bas jaise taise khane peene ka kharcha nikal aata tha, ab hum crorepati hain. (Earlier, we would barely make ends meet, and now I am a crorepati),"" said Jaiveer. ""We are still the same people though,"" he quickly added.The family spent around Rs 5 lakh on the daughter's marriage, sending her off with all possible gifts that the villagers would have only dreamt of. ""The fridge and washing machine, double bed and other furniture that we gave her on the wedding, wouldn't have been possible earlier,"" said Asha Devi, his sister-in-law.Farmers Pyaare Lal and his brother Munshi Lal who live in Rata Purwa under Behrin Panchayat also joined the crorepati club overnight with over Rs 1 crore they received for their 7-8 bighas of land, that fell right on the highway curve. The family bought more land, a plot for a house and spent quite a sum of money on the treatment of one of their sons who met with an accident. ""One of my sons wanted to get into the police but was falling short since I could not put him in a good coaching and training centre due to lack of money. With the sum we got, he has now finally entered the police services and is posted in Fatehpur,"" said Pyaare Lal with pride.Another farmer, Raghuvir, from Rata Purwa had for the past two years been thinking of marrying off his daughter but borrowing a sum of Rs 4 lakh would have been too high a loan to take care of. Suddenly, the expressway came in and Raghuvir breathed a sigh of relief when his family was compensated for 16 bighas of land for a sum of over Rs 1 crore as the rate here was less as compared to Jaiveer's village.""Itni achhi shaadi na kar pate. I married her with the choicest of gifts that I had wanted to give my daughter. The wedding party was a big one with over 150 people from the grooms' side alone and the entire village still remembers it,"" he said. Not just the marriage, Raghuvir spent the money in buying more land, keeping his farming intact and also got a new house made."

Farmers told TOI that as they could not withdraw money from banks, they failed to get adequate amount of fertilizer, affecting quality of crop. Many said they were forced to take loans from moneylenders to buy agricultural inputs.BJP organized Mati-Tilak Pratigya to woo farmers ahead of the state assembly elections. Though hundreds of farmers across the district gathered at the event, they told TOI that they were hit hard by demonetisation.Shyamlal, a farmer from Meerganj, said, ""Though I stood in queues a few times outside bank, I failed to withdraw money on time and I could only get Rs 2,000 currency notes from the ATM, which was insufficient. As I did not have the cash, I could not purchase adequate quantity of fertiliser and pesticide for my wheat crop. My crop got damaged because proper care was not taken and I ended up incurring a loss of Rs 10,000.""Another farmer, Gaya Prasad from Fatehganj West said, ""Unable to withdraw money or exchange currency notes at the bank, I was forced to take a loan from a moneylender at an interest rate of 10%. This time, the delay in sowing of wheat and mustard will lead to less yield."" He added, ""I support demonetisation as it affected the rich and corrupt but it affected my crop this season. I will also have to pay interest later.""A resident of Bijamau village in Nawabganj, Tarlok Ram Gangwar, said, ""Bank officials gave money only to big traders and made us leave even after waiting in serpentine queues for days. We failed to get money to purchase fertiliser, seeds and bear the cost of diesel."" Another farmer, Ramveer, from Golenagra village in Fatehganj West said, ""We are habitual of standing in queues for purchasing every item of need but this time, we could not get cash when we needed it most. We had to borrow money and now, will have to pay interest rate which is an additional burden on us.""However, BJP MP from Aonla, Dharmendra Kashyap who was the chief guest here while addressing farmers claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been taking steps for the welfare of the community. He also mentioned about the schemes introduced by the Centre for farmers. Hitting out at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who had organized ""khat sabhas' across UP, Kashyap said, ""A man who is unaware whether potatoes grow on trees or underground or how red chillies are made, has conducted khat sabhas for farmers. How can one help farmers when he is unaware about the problems faced by the community."""

12,‘Serious job losses are taking place’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/%E2%80%98Serious-job-losses-are-taking-place%E2%80%99/article17047770.ece,2017-01-17,The Hindu,"More than two months after the demonetisation, Nobel Laureate and economist Amartya Sen says that any proper economic reasoning could not have sensibly led to such a ham-handed policy. He predicts that the demonetisation will hit the economy quite drastically. In an interview with Suvojit Bagchi at his home in Santiniketan, which he visits every winter, Professor Sen spoke about the motives and impact of the move.Weve seen the primary impact of the demonetisation: long queues outside banks and shortage of cash. Now we are seeing the secondary impact, which is on the informal sector. Potato sowing in West Bengal is affected and some other businesses are collapsing. What could be the impact of all this?What you are calling the secondary impact shouldnt at all be surprising since the availability of money plays a very big part in facilitating business and trade. Particularly for small businesses (farming, for example), money is often used in the form of cash. In the long run, cashless transactions can perhaps be made into routine practice, through organisation and training, but that would take time. To act on the presumption of instant learning and institutionalisation is to place the hard-earned interests of many people without any connection to black money in serious risk.Most of what we now call cash is actually promissory notes, the emergence of which reflected a big advance over relying only on precious metals (like gold and silver). Promissory notes played a significant part in building up the financial backbone of industrial Europe. If in the 18th or 19th century, Britain had been demonetised suddenly, it would have devastated British industrial progress.Given the underdevelopment of electronic accounts and transactions, big parts of the economy are similarly vulnerable. For many, especially among the poor, making efficient and correct use of electronic payments and receipts would remain difficult to master and the possibility of losing ones money would be hard to avoid, especially given the shortage of infrastructure and the slowness of learning in using cashless transactions. The perplexing question is why some people  those who gave us demonetisation  did not foresee that this would happen and even more perplexing is how the promoters of demonetisation can be so blind even now to the overwhelming evidence of a crisis.Why has over 85 per cent of cash suddenly been taken out of circulation?The Government of India seems to have been caught in a confusion of purposes. Demonetisation has been seen both as a way of catching and eliminating black money, and as a way of moving towards a cashless economy. The former has gradually been replaced in the rhetoric of the government by the latter, which is not surprising as demonetisation can make only a very small contribution  at a huge social cost  to the black money problem. This is because only a very small proportion of black money (it is estimated to be 6 per cent or so, certainly less than 10 per cent) is in cash. Most black money is in the form of precious metals and other assets in foreign accounts. The inconvenience and loss imposed with no black money (workers earning wages; small businesses doing trade or production; people, even housewives, keeping small savings) are much more acute than any benefit from catching relatively small amounts of black money. There are going to be huge job losses too, and the recent reports by All India Manufacturers Organisation are beginning to show that serious job losses are already happening as a result of what Londons Financial Times has called a dramatic drop in business in the 34 days since Narendra Modi announced his plan to scrap 86 per cent of its banknotes.The unrealistic governmental expectation that the black money problem can be solved, or largely removed, by demonetisation soon became clear even to the government. Then the initially trumpeted objective of getting rid of black money through demonetisation was suddenly changed into a very different objective  to leap rapidly into a cashless society. However, for such a structural change, much more time is needed, and the draconian measures  penalties installed in the hope of catching black money  are particularly ill-suited. The result has been a combination of chaos and widespread suffering rather than an orderly transition to a cashless society.Do you think there are political reasons behind the demonetisation move? The elections are coming up, so that may have been one?I dont really know. Since economic reasoning could not have sensibly led to such a ham-handed policy, it is natural for people to suspect an explanation in terms of political advantages that the ruling parties were expecting to get. It has certainly given, at least for the time being, a great political image to the Prime Minister of being a huge fighter against corruption, even though the policy has done very little to achieve anything on that front.These 50 days of hardship will not take black assets out of the economy?How could it? Only a very small proportion of black money (around 6 per cent, certainly less than 10 per cent) is in cash. How can cleaning up of 10 per cent, at most, of black money clean it all up? Even that 10 per cent is a huge overestimate, since the black money dealers are much more skilled in overcoming official barriers than are normal honest people who are simply harassed  or made to lose their money  because of their lack of specialised skill in avoiding transaction barriers.If it is a bad policy, why do you think there havent been protests against demonetisation yet?The governments publicity surrounding this inept move has been very strong. People have been told again and again that if you are against demonetisation, you must be in favour of black money. This is a ridiculous analysis, but a readily exploitable political slogan. The persistent crisis created by demonetisation is only slowly becoming clear in terms of hard statistics as well as in public perception.The false perception of nobility and success can be held up through endless repetition of distorted facts and propaganda. The truth may ultimately prevail, but the government might be able to maintain the loyalty of a large part of the public for a long time, certainly until after the U.P. elections.It is worth remembering that the notorious Irish famines in the 1840s did not immediately cause serious public agitation against the government run from London. That happened only later  much later  but when it did happen, the understanding of blame had a huge long-run impact, making the Irish people deeply suspicious of everything that the government in London did.The false perception of nobility and success can be held up through endless repetition of distorted facts and propaganda"

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India. The price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, The New Indian Express reported on December 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a Chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.Similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in Nashik, Hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.Worst hit: Southern tomato farmers, western onion farmersTomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in Maharashtra and Gujarat, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of vegetable prices in seven Indian citiesAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbaibetween November 2015 and November 2016.Source: National Horticulture Board; Negative values indicate rise in pricesThe price of potatoes, which have a shelf life of up to 2-3 months, was stable in places such as Delhi and Chennai, while it rose between 17% and 25% in Bengaluru and Mumbai. The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops. Suddenly, the markets were depressed due to oversupply and because there was no cash.Singh predicted the situation would be normal over the next quarter, and crops would fetch a good price for farmers by the summer of 2017."

All vegetables at Re 1 a kg. These are the rates at which Gautam Budh Nagar farmers are selling their harvest to middlemen and retailers at the sabzi mandi (weekly farmer's market) in Jewar. The middlemen truck the produce to faraway mandis, while the small vendors cart their daily buy to local markets. Like the rest of India, here in Jewar, , despite a good harvest, there are no takers for the produce.Distraught farmers blame the market meltdown on demonetisation . There's a glut, but procurement prices have crashed over the last two months. With cash flow still disrupted, farmers are selling at throw-away rates.Local vendors on carts and at roadside stalls are selling vegetables at Rs 5-8 per kg. ""What we are picking up from farmers is selling very slowly. People are not buying much. Most farmers are selling produce at Rs 1-2 per kg,"" said Baleshwar, a middleman. Jewar farmers are selling produce in Palwal in Haryana or Bulandshahr, with few bringing their produce to the wholesale market at the SEZ II, Noida, he added.Vendor Md Salim said he has bought 50kg of potatoes at Rs 250 from a middleman. He has tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and seasonal fruits on his cart. Over a week, he expected to sell the potatoes at Rs 7/kg and carrots at Rs 10/kg, giving him an average profit of Rs 2/kg of vegetables sold, and an overall profit of Rs 300-500.Some farmers claimed the crash will continue affecting them for several months, as winter is when they make a clean profit, which helps them tide over the year's uncertainties.""We're ruined. Some farmers are so frustrated, they're dumping truckloads of cabbages or tomatoes by the roadside, or selling at rock-bottom prices.

This year, we sold at Rs 4,800. From Rs 9,000 per quintal last year, arhar dal is down to Rs 3,500. Sugarcane growers haven't received payments for four months. A quintal of rice is going for Rs 2,100. Yesterday, a tractor of tomatoes went for Rs 20. This morning, cabbage went for Rs 10 for 10 kg,"" Singh added.TOI caught Singh and other farmers discussing current affairs in Charauli, a five-minute-drive from Neemka, the model village adopted by BJP MP and Union minister Mahesh Sharma. Charauli is one of the many villages which falls under Jewar's shelved airport project.At Mahesh's house in Charauli, where the farmers had gathered, tons of unpolished rice can be seen rotting. Jewar doesn't have a rice mill. ""We've not been able to sell the kharif crop for four months,"" said Rakesh Nambardar, former district BJP president.In desperation, farmers are pinning their hopes on the upcoming assembly polls. ""Either we get a good price for the produce, or facilities for food processing and cold storage. Even our money is locked in banks. How are we going to survive?"" said BKU's Singh."

""The recent example before us is the heavy losses suffered by farmers of potato and pea crops due to demonetisation,"" said Virsa Singh , who owns seven acres, while addressing a gathering at Bachiwind village on Saturday.The farmers are of the view that if there was an MSP for potatoes and peas, they would have not suffered any losses since the government was bound to purchase their produce at a fixed rate, but the situation was other way round. ""Peas were sold for Rs 15-20 per kg last year, but now they are sold for Rs 4-6 a kilo. Many farmers ploughed the crop in fields only,"" said BASC general secretary Rattan Singh Randhawa.Anup Singh, a farmer who had lost wheat and basmati crop due to bad weather, said elections were the only time when people gave a patient hearing to them.

If it does not, the revenue from the power will continue to provide more income to an emboldened Taliban.Drug tradeThe Taliban have long tapped into Afghanistans lucrative drug trade and illegal mining, in addition to the streams of donations they receive from supporters abroad, mainly in the Persian Gulf states. But in the past two years, they have found new ways of diversifying and collecting revenue, according to interviews with officials, Taliban commanders and local residents.The diversification of the revenue collection system has raised fears that the balance of the war could tilt even further in the year ahead, and that the insurgency is becoming more entrenched and acting as a shadow government in parts of the countryside.What it suggests, essentially, is that the group is becoming more efficient in systematically taxing the areas they either control or have a lot of influence on, said Timor Sharan, senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group, a research institute. Efficiency of taxation is quite significant in terms of sustaining the group for a long time.In addition to collecting electricity bills from thousands of homes in provinces such as Kunduz and Helmand, the insurgents levy taxes on potato harvests, flour mills, teachers salaries, marriage ceremonies, and fuel and vegetable trucks crossing their checkpoints.At the same time, the Taliban continue to pursue their original sources of funding. The United Nations, in a recent report, said narcotics, illegal mining and external donations remained major income streams, with the drug economy bringing in up to $400 million in 2016.

19,Tomato trade feels currency squeeze,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170130/jsp/bengal/story_133058.jsp,2017-01-30,Telegraph,"Purulia, Jan. 29: Thousands of tomato growers in Purulia and Bankura have been hit hard by the absence of buyers of the fruit-vegetable, a not-so-indispensable item in this season of demonetisation. A tomato vendor waits for customers at Urma in Purulia. Picture by Mita Roy Farmer Balaram Kisku, who has cultivated around 100 quintals of tomato in Purulia in November-December, has been feeding a part of his produce to cattle instead of letting it rot in the fields. Agriculture department officials said the demand for tomato was all the more hit because people in eastern India can do without the fruit-vegetable in the kitchen, unlike potato or onion. According to the officials, around 1,000 tomato farmers had been hit in Purulia and Bankura. ""I sold tomato at Rs 20 a kg between October and November. The demand started falling in the middle of November and with it, the price too came down. The situation has come to such a pass that I am being forced to sell a bucket of tomato (around 20-22kg) for only Rs 10 to the wholesalers,"" said Kisku, a resident of Hatinada village on the Ayodhya hills. The vegetable trade has been hit hard in rural Bengal, where wholesalers depend on cash and digital transactions are still a hard nut to crack. ""The cash crunch has left vegetable farmers in serious trouble. The situation is worse for tomato growers because people can do without tomato for days. If people have cash, they would rather spend on potato than tomato,"" an agriculture department official said. In Purulia and Bankura, farmers usually grow tomato between October and March. Officials said the dry climate in the two districts and the hilly terrain are conducive to growing tomato. In the last season, about 3,000 tonnes of tomato had been supplied to various parts of the country from Purulia and Bankura. But this time, the demand has plunged several notches. Ramesh Pandit, a Dhanbad-based tomato wholesaler who owns a warehouse in Purulia's Balarampur, said around 150 quintals of the fruit-vegetable were lying unsold with him. Sources in the agriculture department said a good production this time had added to the trouble of tomato wholesalers in Bengal, which has very few multipurpose cold storage and processing units."
20,"GDP to rise next fiscal, says Economic Survey",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594051/gdp-rise-next-fiscal-says.html,2017-01-31,Deccan Herald,"New Delhi, Jan 31, 2017 (PTI) 16:22 ISTIndia's economic growth is likely to dip to 6.5 per cent this fiscal after shock demonetisation shaved off a good 0.5 percentage points but it will rebound to 6.75-7.5 per cent in the next financial year, Economic Survey said today, calling for bold cut in tax rates.The pre-Budget pointer called for cut not just in individual income tax rates and a timetable for reducing the corporate taxes but also for widening the net to progressively encompass ""all high incomes"".Though the Survey did not indicate what it meant by all high incomes, the reference may be to agriculture income which is currently out of the tax net.Invoking Mahatma Gandhi's vision of 'wiping every tear from every eye', it made a pitch for implementing Universal Basic Income (UBI) to entitle the poor with at least some income and thus eliminate poverty.""Given the uncertainty (after demonetisation), we provide a range: a 0.25 percentage point to 1 percentage point reduction in nominal GDP growth relative to the baseline of 11.25 per cent; and a 0.25 percentage point to 0.5 percentage point reduction in real GDP growth relative to the baseline of estimate of about 7 per cent,"" it said.Indian economy had grown by 7.6 per cent in 2015-16 and was projected to grow by 7.1 per cent in the current fiscal by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) that did not fully account for the disruption demonetisation had caused.""Over the medium run, the implementation of the GST, follow-up to demonetisation, and enacting other structural reforms should take the economy towards its potential real GDP growth of 8 per cent to 10 per cent,"" said the Survey tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley ahead of Union Budget 2017-18 to be unveiled tomorrow.For the 2017-18 fiscal, beginning on April 1, it put the real GDP growth at 6.75 per cent to 7.5 per cent rage. ""Even under this forecast, India would remain the fastest growing major economy in the world.""The forecast however had downside risks in the extent to which the effects of demonetisation could linger into next financial year, especially if uncertainty remains on the policy response.""Currency shortages also affect supplies of certain agricultural products, especially milk (where procurement has been low), sugar (where cane availability and drought in the southern states will restrict production), and potatoes and onions (where sowings have been low),"" the Survey said, asking the government to be vigilant on prevent other agricultural products becoming what pulses was in 2015-16.It also listed surge in global oil prices and possible eruption of trade tensions amongst the major countries as other risks.Prepared by a team led by Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian, the Survey said economic growth is expected to return to normal as new currency notes in required quantities come back into circulation.The pre-Budget document said demonetisation is also very unusual in its monetary consequences.""It has reduced sharply, the supply of one type of money  cash  while increasing almost to the same extent another type of money  demand deposits. This is because the demonetised cash was required to be deposited in the banking system,"" it said.To ensure that demonetisation indeed proves a catalyst for long-run changes in behaviour will require measures to complement with other non-punitive, incentive-compatible measures that reduce the incentives for tax evasion.""Demonetisation was a potentially powerful stick which now needs carrots as complements,"" it said prescribing a five-pronged strategy.It includes implementing Goods and Service Tax (GST) with broad coverage to include activities that are sources of black money creation  land and other immovable property.Also, individual income tax rates and real estate stamp duties should be reduced while a timetable for reducing the corporate tax rate could be accelerated, the Survey said.""The income tax net could be widened gradually and, consistent with constitutional arrangements, could progressively encompass all high incomes. (After all, black money does not make fine sectoral distinctions),"" it said.Besides, tax administration could be improved to reduce discretion and improve accountability, it added.Oil price rise to USD 60-65 per barrel could lead to reduction in consumption in India, less room for public investment and lower corporate margins, thereby further denting private investment, said the Survey.""The scope for monetary easing might also narrow, if higher oil prices stoked inflationary pressure,"" it added.It termed the passage of Constitutional amendment, paving the way for implementing the transformational GST, and demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as major domestic policy developments of the year.""The GST will create a common Indian market, improve tax compliance and governance, and boost investment and growth; it is also a bold new experiment in the governance of India's cooperative federalism,"" it said.Demonetisation, it said, has had ""short-term costs but holds the potential for longterm benefits"".""Follow-up actions to minimise the costs and maximise the benefits include: fast, demand-driven, remonetisation; further tax reforms, including bringing land and real estate into the GST, reducing tax rates and stamp duties; and acting to allay anxieties about over-zealous tax administration,"" it said.These actions would allow growth to return to trend in 2017-18, following a temporary decline in 2016-17, it said.The Survey said: ""Looking further ahead, societal shifts in ideas and narratives will be needed to overcome three long-standing meta-challenges: inefficient redistribution, ambivalence about the private sector and property rights, and improving but still-challenged state capacity.""In the aftermath of demonetisation, and at a time of gathering gloom about globalisation, articulating and embracing those ideational shifts will be critical to ensuring that India's sweet spot is enduring not evanescent."""

In western suburbs, truckloads of onions are brought for sale. Six kg of onions are sold for Rs. 100.Wholesale traders said there had been a 20 per cent increase in the price of locally grown vegetables in the past few days. But, the cost of some vegetables such as potato and carrot remain stable.Green peas and broad beans are popular choices as they are priced in the range ofRs. 20 and Rs. 25 in the wholesale market.Normally, prices go up in December and drop after Pongal.This time, prices of vegetables remained low due to demonetisation. Drought in other places has influenced the price now. The vegetable market receives only 350 loads of produce against its normal share of 400 truckloads daily.P. Sukumar, joint secretary of Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market Merchants Association, said normally, it takes two months for fresh harvest of vegetables.The cost of locally grown vegetables received from areas in the radius of 100 km may slightly dip by mid-February.But, the severity of drought and summer may have an impact on the prices of vegetable in the coming months. There are chances for the prices to escalate by 50 per cent in April if there is not enough rainfall, he said.Vegetable crops were destroyed during cyclone, particularly in Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram"
22,Has Akhilesh turned Agra into Paris? Young Yadav seems to be beating BJP on development in Uttar Pradesh,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/jan/31/has-akhilesh-turned-agra-into-paris-young-yadav-seems-to-be-beating-bjp-on-development-in-uttar-pra-1565545.html,2017-01-31,The New Indian Express,"AGRA: With the 2014 Narendra Modi wave a thing of the past, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav appears to be taking ove the development plank from the BJP for the upcoming Assembly elections. While farmers appear anguished that much of the promises made by the BJP during the 2014 polls remained unfulfilled, the chief minister seem to be beating the anti-incumbency factor, as locals claimed that Yadav has turned Agra into Paris.Even while the long drawn out family feud within the Yadav clan continues to command the attention of the people on the lines of a never ending television serial, the state chief minister seems to be gaining the support. Akhilesh Yadav has taken the right step to take control of the party. Mulayam Singh Yadav should have passed the baton to avoid the family drama. Akhilesh Yadav has done a lot of good works for the state. There is no anti-incumbency factor against him, said Rajesh Pachauri of Bakalpur village in Mathura.Even while the BSP supremo Mayawati had faced the CBI probe in the Taj corridor project, the chief minister seems getting the credit for its completion. With carved and lighted red-sandstone pillars dotting the Taj corridor in Agra, the stretch has become a major tourist attraction. Akhilesh Yadav has turned Agra into Paris. You may just go and take a look, said Rohit Singh, who added that the inner ring road in the city along with the promises of airport and Metro have endeared the chief minister closer to the people in Agra.Even while Agra had traditionally been a BSP bastion, the SP is making spirited attempt to make inroads into the area. The prospects of the SP had apparently taken a hit after the sudden demise of its nominee Chandrasen Taplu. However, his wife Mamata Taplu, who is now the SP candidate from Agra Cantonment, after winding off campaigning late evening, told EXPRESS that people in the city are rallying behind the chief minister due to his development credentials. He is a youth with a clean image. The chief minister has fulfilled all promises that he had made for Agra. My husband had also done a lot of developmental works, said Mamata Taplu.While Akhilesh Yadav is drumming up support for completion of road projects and welfare schemes, the BJP is facing anger of the farmers. Farmers sowed pulses in the hope of better prices. But once the crop matured, the prices crashed. Similarly, the potato farmers could not recover even half the input cost, said Ajay Singh, a farmer in Sikandara.Having won the political battle against his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav, people on the ground claimed that the chief minister could not be blamed for poor law and order situations in the state. People are well aware that there were bad elements who did not allow the chief minister to function independently for most parts of his tenure. Now that those elements are out of the party, Akhilesh Yadav has come out clean and stronger. The Muslims will back him in this elections, said Gani Mohammed, a retired teacher, in Agra."

Currency squeeze was less severe than perceived.Aim of demonetisation is to bring down real estate prices.Bank credit affected by demonetisation seems like it has come down. Overall picture is mixed.Not appropriate to do a before-after analysis of GDP growth, with respect to demonetisation.Demonetisation has short term costs, potential long term benefits.Balance sheet of banks and private sector still challenged; much of debt is in large companies.External challenges include rise in oil prices and protectionism.(With agency inputs)"
24,Next year isn’t exactly smooth sailing: Economic Survey,http://indianexpress.com/article/business/budget/union-budget-next-year-isnt-exactly-smooth-sailing-economic-survey-arun-jaitley-4501572/,2017-01-31,Indian Express,"Finance Minister Arun Jailtey (File Photo) Finance Minister Arun Jailtey (File Photo)A day ahead of the Union Budget, the Economic Survey for 2016-17 tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley does not present a bright picture for the next financial year 2017-18. While it does expect the growth rate to inch up, placing it within a wide band of 6.75-7.5 per cent, it warns of downside risks due to rising oil prices, trade tensions and increasing protectionism.Read | Economic Survey 2016-17: Here are the highlightsIn the current year or 2016-17, the Survey expects the economy to grow 6.5-6.75 per cent, with demonetisation lopping off 0.25-0.5 percentage points from a baseline growth of 7 per cent.Read | Economic Survey 2017: Everything you need to knowWATCH VIDEO | Budget 2017 Interview: Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman & CEO, HDFC On Affordable Housing & MoreThe Central Statistics Office (CSO), in the first advance estimates for 2016-17, had projected Indias GDP to grow 7.1 per cent, not taking into account the impact of demonetisation. The Survey also adds that recorded GDP growth in the second half of this year will understate the overall impact because the most affected parts of the economy  informal and cash-based  are either not captured in the national income accounts or their measurement is based on formal sector indicators.In an interview to The Indian Express, the Surveys principal author and Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, however, warned that closing H1B visas and restrictions on outsourcing will affect growth by affecting exports. While the Survey is optimistic about exports due to expectations of a fiscal stimulus by the US, he said India was quite vulnerable to restrictions on services.WATCH VIDEO | Does Budget 2017 Incentivise Investment Into Housing Or Not?The kind of difference between China and Mexico and us is that Mexico and China are much more vulnerable to restrictions on manufacturing.We are much more vulnerable to restrictions on services and the H1-B kind of attack in a direct way, so one has to worry quite a bit that any reversal of globalisation in this atmosphere could also mean restrictions on exports of services and thats bad news. We cannot move towards 8-10 per cent (growth) if thats the way the world markets (behave)then we have to revise down realistically our growth target and potential, Subramanian said.Indias period of rapid growth of 8-9 per cent would not have been possible without the exports growth of 25 per cent, he added.According to the CEA, the immediate challenge faced by the economy was the twin balance-sheet problem  over-leveraged companies and bad loan-encumbered banks.When asked why has the government not been able to tackle this festering problem, he said, world over this is a very difficult problem. Its less about banks than it is about companies. Most stressed debt is with large companies. And then, there is always a temptation to see this as a morality play  that the guy has got away with it, and not as an economic problem, which it is today. In India, its doubly difficult because you have what you call the 4C problem  Court, CVC, CBI and CAG. I dont mean to be pejorative, but this is a fact of life, Subramanian said.WATCH VIDEO | Does Budget 2017 Incentivise Investment Into Housing Or Not?The Survey has advocated the setting up of a Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency, similar to what East Asian countries did after severe twin balance sheet problems in the 1990s.Also, private investment is unlikely to recover significantly, the Survey said, from the levels of FY2017. Some of this weakness could be offset through higher public investment, but that would depend on the stance of fiscal policy next year, which has to balance the short-term requirements of an economy recovering from demonetisation against the medium-term necessity of adhering to fiscal discipline  and the need to be seen as doing so, it said.The document has also flagged the Universal Basic Income (UBI) scheme as a conceptually appealing idea that could work as an alternative to the various social welfare programmes that are targeted at reducing poverty. There were a number of implementation challenges, especially the risk that it would become an add-on to, rather than a replacement of, current anti-poverty and social programmes, which would make it fiscally unaffordable, it noted.Listing the other challenges, the Survey said that vigilance would be essential to prevent a price spiral for certain agricultural products such as milk, sugar, potatoes and onions, whose supplies get affected due to currency shortages. The scope for monetary easing might also be narrow, if higher oil prices stoked inflationary pressure, it added.WATCH VIDEO | Budget 2017 Expectations: TaxesDetailing the impact of demonetisation on the economy, the Survey said, short-term costs have taken the form of inconvenience and hardship, especially those in the informal and cash-intensive sectors of the economy which have lost income and employment. These costs, however, are transitory, and may be minimised in recorded GDP as it estimates informal activity on the basis of formal sector indicators, which have not suffered to the same extent as informal sectors, the document said.In the long-term, demonetisation has the potential to generate benefits in terms of reduced corruption, greater digitalization of the economy, increased flows of financial savings, and greater formalization of the economy, all of which could eventually lead to higher GDP growth, better tax compliance and greater tax revenues, it said.Since the magnitude and extent of short-term costs of demonetisation are uncertain, the Survey said that certain policy responses are needed by remonetising the economy expeditiously by supplying as much cash as necessary, especially in lower denomination notes, bringing land and real estate into the GST, reducing taxes and stamp duties and ensuring that the follow-up to demonetisation does not lead to over-zealous tax administration.The Survey said that the Indian economy recovering from demonetisation will need policy support, which could be in the form of lower policy rates and fiscal policy support as there is cyclical weakness on account of demonetisation.For all the latest Business News, download Indian Express App"
25,Bihar wish-list for Mr Jaitley,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170201/jsp/bihar/story_133304.jsp,2017-02-01,Telegraph,"What does Bihar expect for itself when Arun Jaitley rises to present the budget on Wednesday? Before every budget, there is hope in states that specific doles would be offered to them. But the Union budget is not for any particular state. Its for all the states. However, if funds are increased for departments, Bihar will also benefit, remarked former state finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi even as the current finance minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui expressed the hope that Bihar would be given major concessions. The Telegraph finds out what the wish-list of some key sectors is. ROADPromises and more promises but precious little has been done. The Centre has failed to fulfil the promises made to the state regarding the road sector despite repeated meetings. Union minister in charge of roads, Nitin Gadkari, had promised that Bihar would get Rs 50,000 crore for road projects, which did not take off. The state sent a proposal of upgrading 3,600km of roads to national highways; in response, the union ministry agreed to upgrade just 13 state highways covering a total of 910km. Promises made by the Centre to construct 53 road over bridges too have not been fulfilled. Several national highways are in need of urgent repair. All that the Centre has approved is a new link between Sahibganj bypass in Jharkhand to Manihari bypass in Bihar, including four-lane bridges over the Ganga, and Rs 1,742.01 crore for the rehabilitation of Patnas Gandhi Setu. Bihar road construction minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said: The promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on spending Rs 55000 crore on roads in Bihar are yet to be met. I hope that in this budget, the state gets the funds to repair the national highways and the amount he had promised. RAILWAYThe state expects funds for ongoing projects and betterment in passenger services. Money is required for ongoing projects which include an electric loco manufacturing unit at Madehpura, a wagon workshop at Garhara in Begusarai, a workshop at Jamalpur, and a rail bogie factory at Dalmianagar. ECR officials said a request for capacity augmentation has been sent to the railways for a coach maintenance workshop at Harnaut. Bihar Daily Passengers Association secretary Shoaib Quraishi said: The railways need to work on issues like safety of passengers, punctuality of trains, confirmed berths, improvement in on-board services and emphasis on the cleanliness inside trains and station premises. We are expecting that the railway will also work on improving the quality of food. HEALTHHealth experts are hoping that the total expenditure on the healthcare sector will increase. As per the last budget, the total expenditure for health was only 1.62 per cent of the whole budget out of which the National Health Mission had a share of less than one per cent. We are expecting an increase in the total expenditure on the healthcare sector this time. Increasing the budgetary allocation of the National Health Mission would give a boost to healthcare. The finance ministry should also focus on human resource. In 2015, the National Rural Health Mission had recommended formation of a special empowerment recruitment cell in states where there has been a delay in the recruitment of manpower in hospitals. There is a huge scarcity of doctors in state-run hospitals because the Bihar government had failed to fill vacancies in government hospitals, said Dr Ranjit Kumar, general secretary of Bihar Health Services Association. Sunil Kumar Singh, a member of the governing body of Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, said the government should waive customs duty on high-end instruments that are being imported. This will ensure availability of high-end equipment in all hospitals. Besides, subsidies and incentives should be provided to the pharma industries for initiating research work. This will help in creation of new medicines of the same molecule and will ultimately bring down prices of medicines, said Singh. INDUSTRYThe focus of the government is on sectors like leather, textile, food processing to expedite industrial development and job creation. Industrialist Satyajit Singh said the finance minister should focus on increasing domestic consumption, public and private investment, exports and job creation. We feel the Union government should bring down corporate tax to a maximum 25 per cent from the current levels. The rebate on interest paid on housing loan should be increased from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh, as it would boost the demand in the real estate sector and make a positive impact on fiscal sentiments. The GST peak rate should be limited to 20% and the focus should be on developing micro, small and medium enterprises, Singh said. AGRICULTUREAround 80% of Bihars population depends on agriculture and allied activities for a living, but the sector contributes only 25% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP). Progressive farmer and chairman of the marketing wing of Nalanda Organic Vegetable Grower Federation, Rakesh Kumar, said it was time agriculture and horticulture were made profitable ventures, else people would be forced to leave farming. A minimum support price (MSP) should be declared for potato and onion to provide fiscal protection to farmers. Data show that the price of potato and onion has been almost static over the last 20 years, while cost of inputs like fertiliser and pesticide has multiplied several times. The Union budget should declare MSP for potato and onion and provision free electricity for farmers, Rakesh said. TOURISMBihar lacks basic infrastructure in attracting more tourists despite having the potential. Though the flow of tourists to Bihar has increased manifold but soon after their arrival, tourists start thinking about their return. It is due to the lack of proper communication linkage and infrastructure, said an official of the tourism department. Bihar is well known for its heritage sites like Bodh Gaya, Rajgir, Nalanda and Vaishali, besides, historical sites linked with Jainism. But sadly these sites are just that  well known. We hope the budget provides some budgetary incentives to bring these tourist sites on a par with other popular tourist destinations of the country. Again, with certain other measures like converting Bodh Gaya into an international religious city with access without visa (based on passport of respective country) would go a long way in making it an international spiritual destination, the official said. There is still a shortage of budget hotel rooms. The government should make one, two, and three star hotels a priority, because hotel owners do not patronise building budget hotels as they think they wont make any money. The government should come forward and take initiative, the official said. REAL ESTATEThe realty sector has pinned high hopes on the budget with experts hoping to get industry status for housing sector. Sachin Chandra, honorary secretary, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI)Bihar, said: The housing sector has not yet been given the status of industry because of which finance from banks is costlier right now. Once it gets the industry status, loans would become cheaper as well as it will be easily available giving a boost to the realty sector. Also, he added, the government should increase the interest limit on housing loan exemption from the current Rs 2 lakh to either Rs 2.5 lakh or Rs 3 lakh. CIVIL AVIATIONBihar hopes the budget will allocate funds for the modernisation of Patna airport, which has seen a surge in air traffic over the past few years. Passenger flow at the city airport increased from 14.5% in 2014-15 to 32.4% in 2015-16 necessitating the much needed expansion of the airport. We are expecting the budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore to be used for the first phase of expansion work to be carried out with regard to the construction of the terminal building along with other operational requirements, said Patna airport director Rajendra Singh Lahauria."
26,"Thanks to note ban, farm sector may not see 'acche din'",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594489/thanks-note-ban-farm-sector.html,2017-02-02,Deccan Herald,"Sagar Kulkarni, Feb 3, 2017, DHNS 8:48 ISTDateline: New DelhiDays after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of high value currency notes, Agriculture Ministry officials were eagerly awaiting the details about sowing for rabi crops across the country. The government was facing all round criticism for having announced the note ban at a time when the agriculture sector was witnessing an upswing on the back of a better monsoon after two consecutive drought years.The sudden withdrawal of legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes had left the farmers devoid of any cash to buy seeds or fertilisers. But as the figures trickled in, there was a sense of cheer as the sowing operations appeared unaffected.Up to November 11, rabi sowing was completed on 14.6 million hectare area  5.7% lower than normal crop coverage and the gap declined steadily. During the week ending January 20, 2017 sown area under rabi crops was 628.34 lakh hectares, which was 6.07% more than last year's acreage of 592.36 lakh hectares.Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh has been issuing statements on how demonetisation had not affected rabi sowing to counter the campaign by opposition leaders on note-ban leading to agrarian distress.Experts have been sceptical about the government's gung-ho approach vis-a-vis the rabi sowing numbers, particularly the comparison with the previous year's acreage which was low because of severe drought. Though the government speaks glowingly about demonetisation not affecting farm activity, the numbers tell a different story. According to the data released by the Agriculture Ministry, rabi sowing in 2013-14 had touched 670 lakh hectares and leading to a bumper harvest of 263 million tonnes.Economist Pronab Sen was categorical. Rabi sowing looks big on the small base of last year, he said. Sen, India's first chief statistician, also said the government could have pushed for implementation of demonetisation in January this year as the seven-week gap would have helped farmers make purchases of seeds and fertilisers for sowing of the winter crop.According to Sen, delaying note ban by a few weeks would have helped farmers sell their kharif crop, prices of which had already fallen drastically on account of good harvest. The wholesale markets, which usually deal in cash, had a tough time lifting the farm produce and the maximum impact was felt by those dealing in fruits and vegetables.Farmers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh dumped their potato crop on the roads in Ambala and Lucknow, respectively, as they had no cash to pay for transportation of the farm produce to wholesale markets. In Gujarat's Surat, farmers threw vegetables and milk on the streets as they had no access to cash after the government kept out the district central cooperative banks out of the demonetisation process.Prices of fruits and vegetables dropped in wholesale markets post-demonetisation as did the market arrivals. Prices of banana, apple, tomato, cabbage were lower in the range of 4% to 9% in November when compared with the rates in October, making it clear that farmers were affected to some extent.Government analysts say that the prices of tomatoes crashed in December because of glut in the market due to bumper crop. But they admit that it would be difficult to ascertain how much fall was because of the glut and how much due to disruption due to demonetisation.Cash crunch in rural areas had turned acute as the cooperative banks as well as primary cooperative credit societies too were kept out of cash exchange affecting purchase of quality seeds and fertilisers by farmers.There were reports about slowdown in farm activity such as timely spraying of pesticides or application of fertiliser for want of labour. Many farmers were unable to make cash payments to farm labourers who were forced to return to their home towns. Cotton trade nosedived as mills were unable to make cash payments to farmers who supply bales.Quiet acceptanceThere is quiet acceptance of this fact within the government circles as productivity may take a hit this year. Also, farmers have bought far less amount of fertilisers this rabi season when compared with the previous two drought years. One set of estimates peg the sale of fertilisers to be nearly 7.5% lower than the previous year.This means that despite high acreage achieved during the sowing phase may not reflect in the farm output this rabi season. According to a study by Ramesh Chand, Member, Niti Aayog, a 1% increase/decrease in fertiliser use result in 0.1% increase/decrease in agriculture GDP and about 0.14% increase/decrease in crop output.If the current trend in the shortfall in fertiliser consumption continued till the end of the rabi season, it could lead to a more than 1% decline in production. As a result, the rate of growth in farmers income is also expected to dip due to the drop, though Chand still pegs it at 5.8% in real terms for 2016-17.Indias farm sector was looking set for some good times after two consecutive drought years that had slowed down growth and even witnessed a contraction of 0.2% in 2014-15. The normal monsoon had cheered the farmers who had reaped a better kharif harvest and were keen to follow up with even better returns in the winter crop cycle.Ratings agencies had forecast 4% growth for 2016-17 over the previous year which was certainly brighter given the meagre growth in the past couple of years. The sector had barely witnessed growth since 2011. In 2012-13, the farm sector grew by 1.5%, followed by 4.2% in 2013-14, -0.2% in 2014-15 and 1.2% in 2015-16. At a time when things were looking up, the demonetisation decision has pushed the long desired achhe din for agriculture in the realm of uncertainty."

29,Hot puris and a hanging: The legends of Pancham Puriwala,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hot-puris-and-a-hanging-the-legends-of-pancham-puriwala/articleshow/56978828.cms,2017-02-05,The Times Of India,"Sometime in the 1840s, Pancham Das Sharma of Agra's Adhet village donned a fresh dhoti and hopped on a bullock cart to make his slow way to Bombay. The details of that long journey are now hazy but Sharma's legacy, roughly 160-odd years later, is still edible. The deep-fried pooris that the UP villager served up in a corner of 19th-century Fort still form the daily bread for the sixth generation of his descendants.Pancham Puriwala, the famous puri-bhaji cafe on Perin Neriman street, near the GPO, traces its origins to the humble diner that Sharma set up in the late 1840s. Now managed by brothers Sandeep, Anupam, and Akshay , the restaurant retains a lowkey ambience, with its marble tiles and perforated steel seats. There is still no air-conditioning. "" ACs would invite taxes,"" says Anupam Sharma. Worse, it might encourage customers to linger. ""Ours is a khao-aur-khisko joint.""Amid an explosion of new cafes, the eatery's cheap and filling traditional fare continues to pack the tables, drawing both taxi driver and bank manager. A plate of five thick pooris (pancham means five in Hindi) and dry potato sabzi that used to cost four annas in the late 1800s today costs Rs 35. For Rs 60 to Rs 140 a thali, you can also sample modern takes such as masala pooris (infused with urad dal), green pooris (made of spinach) and the popular potato-pumpkin sabzi. ""Our USP is our authentic North Indian taste,"" says Anupam, who eats at the restaurant most nights.Anupam recalls the stories told by his grandfather Badriprasad Sharma , whose garlanded portrait hangs in the restaurant. When Pancham Sharma first came to the city , Perin Nariman street was known as Bazar Gate Street or simply `Bazar Gate' and had no street lights. Pointing to the office of DCP Zone I opposite the eatery, Anupam says the building ""was where petty criminals like ticketless travellers and drunkards used to be locked up."" Nearby is a peepal tree that Anupam says was planted by his great-grandfather, Mangal Singh Sharma.In fact, city historian Deepak Rao says that before 1857, there was a pond facing Pancham Puriwala called Gibbet's pond -locally known as Phansi Talao  which was a popular spot for public executions. In the Sharma household, legend has it that ""large crowds would gather to witness executions and afterwards they would drop in to eat puri-bhaji,"" says Anupam.In the 1960s and '70s, famous folks like music director Khayyam, actor Rajesh Khanna and former politician George Fernandes would grab a bite here. In those years, the Sharmas also briefly ran a sweet shop called Pancham Dugdhalay nearby .Lately there have been some nostalgic visitors. An old customer who moved to Seattle brought his son to the eatery just as his father did before him. And a British couple who were regulars before Independence revisited the restaurant recently . No wonder the late columnist Busybee, aka Behram Contractor once wrote that the eatery should be put on the heritage list.Still, the restaurant is slowly adapting to changing times (with annual margins as high as 30 percent, there seems to be no rush.) In recent years, the menu has been expanded, the interiors revamped, and deliveries started in the Fort area. And now demonetisation -which ate into 15 per cent of business  might force Pancham Puriwala into a revolutionary upgrade. ""We are planning to get a card swipe machine,"" says Anupam."
30,Khanapur’s enterprising women find sweet solution,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/khanapurs-enterprising-women-find-sweet-solution/articleshow/56984425.cms,2017-02-06,The Times Of India,"BELAGAVI: Making ends meet was a tough task for the women of Khanapur taluk. With drought and water scarcity affecting agriculture , the going hasn't been easy. Working in the fields fetched them Rs 150 a day. Money was always short.Around 10 women, in their 20s and 30s, recently came together and founded 'ShivParvati' self-help group by registering it with Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Program (SKRDP). The idea was to supplement their income and cut down on the mounting debts. Prabhakar Naik , a resource person from SKRDP, encouraged the women to form a group and start small savings. But the women had to pinch and scrape to save even Rs 50 from their daily wages.Naik saw that Khanapur had large swathes growing sweet potato. But the farmers growing sweet potato were not doing well as the government has not fixed even a minimum support price for this vegetable. ""My job is to empower women by creating jobs for them and improve their livelihood. I thought of a part-time job for these women so that they can earn some extra money and improve their livelihood,"" says Naik.Naik advised this group to try making snacks from sweet potato and sell them.Says Ashwini Rajput, a member of this group, ""We gave it a shot and started making snacks from sweet potato. We started selling a 100 gm packet for Rs 20. Well, it clicked surprising us too. We have been getting a good response and now we have also started taking bulk orders.""The women even recently bought a small potato cutting machine for Rs 5,000 from the money they managed to save. Every evening after a hard day in the fields, the group gathers at one of the members' houses to prepare the snacks. Tulsa Chougule, another member, says that while eight of the women are involved in preparing the snacks, two of them market it. The profit earned is distributed equally among all, she adds."
31,Abundant supply keeps vegetable prices normal,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Abundant-supply-keeps-vegetable-prices-normal/article17245191.ece,2017-02-08,The Hindu,"This season, consumers have plenty to choose from as many varieties of vegetables are up for sale, say traders. Though the cost of many of the vegetables continues to be stable, tomatoes and brinjal cost more than last week.The prices of most of the vegetables have not increased. All vegetables are available now, the supply is also good leaving customers with plenty of choice, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.He added that the rates of tomatoes and brinjal have gone up in the last one week. While the cost of a kilo of tomatoes has almost doubled from Rs. 10 toRs. 20, the price of brinjal (thorny variety) has increased from Rs. 12  Rs. 15 to Rs. 20  Rs. 30, he added.Onions cost lesser at Rs. 8 to Rs. 15, while small onions were priced at Rs. 20 a kilo. The price of potatoes range from Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, depending on the quality, while beans cost Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, carrots were priced at Rs. 5 to Rs. 15.Peas are available in plenty. It is mostly supplied from Karnataka. While it costs Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 in the wholesale market, it is sold for Rs. 25 in the retail market. Cauliflower too is available. Medium-sized cauliflower is sold for Rs. 20, while a bigger one cost Rs. 20, Mr. Balu said.Drumstick costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, while green chillies were priced at Rs. 15 Rs. 30. The rate of other vegetables are  ladys finger  Rs. 20 to Rs. 30, yam  Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, bitter gourd  Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, snake gourd  Rs. 20, ginger  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30.A bunch of coriander is priced atRs. 20 to Rs. 40 as its supply was comparatively less, he added.Cabbage is sold for low rates. The yield is high now, and so is supply. At present, a gunny bag of cabbage consisting 50 kilos is priced at Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 in the wholesale market. During the corresponding period last year, a gunny bag of cabbage was priced at Rs. 1,000. In the retail market, cabbage is sold for Rs. 5 to Rs. 10, he added. Cabbage is supplied from Hosur and parts of Andhra Pradesh.However, Mr. Balu said that the rates of vegetables might start to increase as the mercury level rises. When the sun soars, the production will be affected and there will be water scarcity. Usually, the rates of vegetables will climb up at this time. It is likely that the costs might go up in March, he added."
32,Note ban ‘most terrible’ decision of Modi Government: Chidambaram,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/note-ban-most-terrible-decision-of-modi-government-chidambaram/,2017-02-09,Indian Express,"Congress leader and former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram. (File photo) Congress leader and former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram. (File photo)Opposition in Rajya Sabha today tore into the government for presenting a disappointing budget, with Congress leader P Chidambaram terming note ban as the most terrible decision and alleging that graft and black money have continued to thrive and large sections adversely affected. The former Finance Minister also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the words he chose to attack his predecessor Manmohan Singh, saying he should remember that the Chair he sat on was used by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and even Atal Bihari Vajpayee and hence he should use right language. Initiating the discussion on the 2017-18 General Budget, he accused the government of fumbling, bumbling, scrambling and inventing a new narrative every day. Observing that he saw his first Rs 2,000 note four days after it came into circulation, he said there were many who were caught with crores worth new notes stashed away. This is the biggest scam of 2016  Where did they get these notes from? Did these go directly from the RBI press to them, Chidambaram asked.This means that corruption and black money have thrived after demonetisation The NSSO says 15 crore people in this country are daily wage earners. 25.5 crore workers are daily income earners. 40 crore people were completely devastated by demonetisation for eight weeks. These 40 crore people may forgive you, but they wont forget the experience, he said.Questioning the remonetisation process, he asked why should you demonetise and then remonetise and said that the government has replenished Rs 9 lakh crore worth of new currency notes as against Rs 17 lakh crore old notes that went out of circulation.Chidambaram said the government had inherited an economy that, in the last two years of the UPA rule, had grown by 6.1 and 6.9 per cent respectively.The average for the 10-year period is 7.5 per cent. India is among the fastest growing large economies in the world. But through 2016-17, you made a series of mistakes, capped by the most terrible mistake, he said pointing at demonetisation.He also asked why was the government shying away from giving a GDP number even while giving an estimate.Terming the budget as a great disappointment, he estimated that 2016-17 will see a hit on GDP by 1-1.5 per cent and if very unlucky, then even 2 per cent and warned that this trend will spill over into 2017-18 also.In an economy that has admittedly slowed down, your Budget contracts government expenditure, Chidambaram said, adding that even in the budget, capital expenditure has been curtailed.You shifted money from defence research and added it to defence capital, he said, pointing to the allocation of Rs 86,484 crore and adding that if the money for research was subtracted, then the actual defence outlay will be much less.The Congress leader noted that the revised estimate came to over Rs 71,000 which meant that either you are unable to spend the money, or you dont have the money to spend.Allocation as a percentage of the GDP has only come down, Chidambaram said as he read out allocation figures of the last three budgets including that of 2016-17.To give a boost to the economy, we have to spend more. This is Economics 101, he said, adding that the economy will suffer because of contracted expenditure.He then spoke about the bull-taming sport of Jallikattu and said the protest over it in Tamil Nadu was only a symbol under which people converged. The most vocal angst is about jobs. There are simply no jobs being created and jobs have been taken away, he said, adding this is the angst that brought young people to the Marina (beach in Chennai).Quoting figures, the Congress leader said 75 per cent of all small and medium industries are closed and then went ahead to state that these figures were as per your (affiliate) trade union, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh.Everybody has different concerns. Some are concerned about intolerance  ban jeans, ban books, ban authors, ban beef We have to find jobs for both the uneducated and the educated, Chidambaram said.Addressing the ruling BJP members, he asked them to tell him one strategy in the Budget which will create jobs. On the contrary, you have destroyed jobs. This is a powder keg. All it requires is a spark. I would like to caution the government, he said.Speaking about farmers, he said the Minimum Support Price gave an indication that agriculture is a viable vocation and farmers should continue as the government was there to take care of them.But there is nothing in the Budget speech about MSP, he said adding that a wrong message was being sent to farmers.Why are you not giving meaningful increases that take note of inflation in your MSP? I am saying I need money to educate my child. I need money to start a small business for my son. I need money to conduct the marriage of my daughter.And you are giving me money to conduct my funeral. Is this the way to treat farmers of this country, he said referring to Fasal Bima Yojana.Observing that the government withdrew 86 per cent of currency overnight, Chidambaram spoke of a large number of ATMs still not functioning.He referred to a village in the national capital territoty which was declared as the first digital village in the region and said you go there and the people ask What digital? It is very difficult to get away with a lie. The best way to do so is to utter the biggest lie.Taking a dig at the government, Chidamabaram said RBI officials are busy counting the notes physically. You speak about digitisation. First, teach that to the RBI. Every rupee has come back, except in Bhutan, Nepal and NRIs, whose money cant come now, because you breached your promise to them.He also asked if Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are the cause of such major ills, how does Rs 2,000 note put an end to it. If 10 per cent of bank officials were dishonest earlier, now youve made all bank officials dishonest.It has now become easier for people used to carrying briefcases of notes as they will have to carry a smaller brief case, he said wryly.Chidambaram gaves examples of countries which still uses cash including the US, Autralia and Austria.A young lady wants to buy lingerie. Why should there be a record? A young couple wants to take a secret holiday. Why should that be recorded? I want to give money to my daughter-in-law for her expenses without the knowledge of my son. Why should there be a record? An adult wants to buy adult diapers.Why should there be a record of that?There are serious issues of privacy are involved which are respected in any democracy, he said, adding that people cant be told to go to the village fair and buy potatoes and tomatoes for Rs 7.50 and use credit cards.Dont even try to defend demonetisation. At least spare us the ignominy of listening to this defence, he said.Maintaining that the budget has been a great disappointment, he said there is no overarching vision and goal. It has no strategy. By cutting expenditure, youve shown that your government has no empathy for the poor. Government must lean towards the poor. After all this, what have you achieved? You cant achieve your fiscal goal of 3 per cent. This Budget is a demonstrable failure of economic management.Talking about RBIs decision not to cut policy rate, Chidambaram said it shows the Budget has no credibility.RBI does not believe your numbers. The Governor has said they are moving from an accommodative position to a neutral position. He has no faith in the story that you are projecting.

Growers are saying that post-demonetisation, there has been no rise in price and buyers dwindled, too. Even a couple of years back, potatoes used to be sold at Rs 3,000-4,000 per quintal.Watch What Else is Making NewsSo, growers are demanding government help to export potatoes and get a good price. Punjab is expecting a production of over 2.2 million tonnes whereas it has the capacity to store around 16 lakh tonnes in the nearly 500 cold stores. But the old crop, lying in the cold stores, needs to be cleared first.Middle-East and Russia always prefer our potatoes. But farmers alone cannot do anything as government support is required post-demonetisation, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary JS Sangha.Small farmers said they cannot even afford to keep potatoes in cold storage which costs more than the price of the crop.At mandis, we are forced to sell potatoes for Rs 3 per kilo while in the retail market, it is Rs 9-10 per kg, said Jagtar Singh, another farmer, from Jandhusinga village.Sangha said keeping potatoes in cold stores is a burden on big farmers, too, as the rate of the crop is less than the cost of keeping it in cold stores.Demonetisation was announced during the sowing season and several traders left without buying the seed which is the best in the country, said Sangha, adding, A large amount of our potato seeds went to waste as buyers from other states had no money.There is a huge demand for potatoes in Russia and Middle-East but farmers alone cannot do anything, said JPGA president Raghbir Singh.We have exported potatoes at Rs 900-1,000 per ql to Russia a couple of years ago on our own. Now, if the government helps us to sell potatoes in Russia and Middle-East, then government and potato growers can earn four times more than at present, said Sangha. By sea, it takes three-four weeks to send potatoes to Russia and the government should arrange for export via Pakistan as it will reach there much early, but no heed is being paid to that, he added.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"
34,Note ban may dent BJP's prospects,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/596238/note-ban-may-dent-bjps.html,2017-02-13,Deccan Herald,"Note ban may dent BJP's prospectsSanjay Pandey, Shahjahanpur (UP), Feb 14, 2017, DHNS 1:08 ISTUP Assembly polls: Farmers who depend on cash crops hit hardDemonetisation has turned out to be one of the major issues in the Assembly elections in several districts of central Uttar Pradesh, where polling is scheduled for Wednesday.This part of the state houses a large number of marginal farmers and small-scale local industries.An interaction with farmers and owners of small industries in this region, including Shahjahanpur, Bareilly, and Lakhimpur-Kheri, gives the impression that besides the caste factor, the note ban issue will also affect voters preference in many of the 67 Assembly seats going to polls in the second phase.Farmers, especially the marginal farmers, who depend on cash crops like potato for their livelihood, suffered greatly owing to the note ban, Bal Govind, a resident of Khutar town, told DH.He said many small and marginal farmers left their crops to rot in the fields as the prices crashed post demonetisation.The cost incurred in harvesting the produce and transporting it to the local market turned out to be more than what it would have fetched the farmers, Govind said.Satya Prakash Verma, a farmer of Dadraul town, echoed similar sentiments. We were ruined by the note ban, he said.Demonetisation also impacted the small local industries that depend heavily on cash transactions to pay wages of the labour procured locally. Traders were also adversely hit.Big industries did not experience the pain... the smaller ones were badly hit, said Rajesh Gupta, a trader in Lakhimpur-Kheri district."

""The Union government (food processing ministry) has granted permission to set up the mega food park in Jharkhand with the help of my company for which the credit goes to chief minister Raghubar Das.

""We would like to request local entrepreneurs to invest in the food park and help develop the state,"" Pandey stressed, adding talks with well-known players in the food processing sector were on.

Prices in wholesale markets rose 5.25 per cent last month from a year earlier, their fastest gain since July 2014, government data showed. In December and November, inflation based on WPI stood at 3.39 per cent and 3.38 per cent, respectively. In January 2016, the print was (-)1.07 per cent.

However, the food inflation basket witnessed a contraction for the second month in a row with inflation at (-) 0.56 per cent in January against (-) 0.70 per cent in December. ""The higher-than-expected print of January WPI is largely a function of rising global prices, helped further by adverse base effects.

The rise in wholesale inflation is in contrast to the fall in retail inflation to a five-year low of 3.17 per cent in January. Industrial production too had contracted 0.4 per cent in December 2016 to a four-month low, with consumer durables taking the worst hit on account of the cash crunch post note ban. Industry chamber Ficci said the industrial economy was still weak and there was a need to improve the flow of credit to manufacturing and infrastructure sectors. ""We also need to see a further reduction in the lending rates by banks and we hope that the RBI's guidance on this to the banks will be followed up in the form of further reduction in rates for companies,"" Ficci said.

He had seen Narendra Modi in real life for the first time and from the closest possible distance. "" Chehra ekdum gora hai, aur chamakta hai (His face is totally fair and it glows),"" Singh, a backward class marginal farmer, tells those gathered at the teashop near his village. Last Wednesday, Modi addressed a rally in Kannauj, and Harinath had managed to wind his way to the front rows on the military ground. The five Assembly seats of Kannauj, represented by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple in the Lok Sabha, will go to polls this Sunday. At the teashop, Congress leader Tariq Bashir confronts Harinath. He asks whether Modi's ""glowing"" face will fetch "" roti"" for Harinath. ""Chehra dekhne se roti milega kya?"" Tariq asks. Harinath retorts "" roti"" is given by ""Bhagwan (God)"" but it is his dharma to respect a big person like Modi who has come to his place. Harinath points out how the Prime Minister has promised to waive loans of small farmers and ensure potato farmers get a fair price if the BJP comes to power in Uttar Pradesh. ""Modiji is such a big man and if he is promising, then we have to believe him,"" Harinath says. Tariq, the Congress leader, keeps arguing but Harinath doesn't give in. Eventually, Bhaiyalal Rathore, a retired teacher, steps in. ""You (Tariq) are opposed to Modi and so whatever he (Harinath) says you will not accept,"" Bhaiyalal says. The argument ends on a pleasant note with no sign of ill-will. Some point out it is "" matdaan (election)"" and so each one has his ""mat (view)"". After tea, Bhaiyalal and Harinath invite this reporter to their village. The village called Gadiya Kachpura, around 2km from the teashop, is dominated by non-Yadav backward classes in an area regarded as Yadav territory and a stronghold of the ruling Samajwadi Party. The over 500 dwellings are inhabited by residents belonging to castes such as Kushwaha, Kahar, Kaanchi, Dohre, besides a couple of Muslim and Yadav families. Gadiya Kachpura has electricity, road connectivity and other basic facilities. Most residents acknowledge "" vikas hua hai"" (development has taken place). They say Kannauj, Mainpuri and Etawah are pocket boroughs of the Yadav family and the association has rewarded the region in terms of development projects. But some spoke of ""one problem"". ""Akhilesh has done a lot of work. Farmers are getting electricity and he has built roads. But there is one problem,"" says Pritam Singh, a Kushwaha. After a pause, he resumes: ""The problem is that one community is being more favoured. The government gives money for the wedding of Muslim girls but not for Hindus. In wazifa (scholarship) too, Muslims get a preference over Hindus."" Amrital a.k.a. Baba, saffron-robed and aged over 60 years, chips in. He claims his old age pension was stopped in 2013 and when he ran from one official to another, he was asked to pay a bribe. He claimed that elderly Muslim men and women get pension without paying any bribe. Vijay Pratap, a 38-year-old teacher at a government school, says there is no communal tension in the region that has never seen any communal flare-up. ""The villagers are upset over one community being given preference by the government,"" he says. Surendra Singh, 50, enters the discussion and says development is not everything. ""Safety and security of the country is most important,"" he says. He says "" badlao"" (change) is needed in Uttar Pradesh to ensure the country is safe and secure. ""Everyday we hear reports of aatankwadi (terrorists) infiltrating. The hands of the leader who works in national interest should be strengthened,"" he says holding up a clenched fist. ""Modi is working in national interest,"" Surendra adds. Many residents acknowledge that local BJP leaders and Vishwa Hindu Parishad representatives had been raising these issues much before the polls were announced. The villagers claimed that in the 2012 Assembly polls, the village had split 50:50 in favour of the Samajwadi Party and the BJP. ""This time it is going to be 80:20 in favour of the BJP,"" said Bhaiyalal Rathore, who claims he was a ""socialist"" but stands disillusioned because of caste and communal politics. The BJP is banking on the support of non-Yadav OBCs to end what they say ""the 14-year exile of the BJP in the land of Rama and Krishna"". Combined with the support of upper castes, the party hopes to regain power in Lucknow. The party has fielded over 100 backward class candidates. The undercurrent of communalism, particularly among the non-Yadav backward classes, appeared to be permeating beyond Gadiya Kachpura village. In Farrukhabad town, 40km away, J.N. Katiar, a retired state government official, insists the BJP is the best option for the state to become "" uttam pradesh (best state)"". ""Modiji will face re-election after two and a half years (the general election in 2019). He will come again seeking votes and so he has no option but to develop Uttar Pradesh. The SP and BSP will loot the state for three years and then do some work,"" he says. But soon Katiar reveals the main reason for his preference for the BJP: "" Hinduyon ki hitayshi sarkar UP ko chahiye (UP needs a government that serves the interest of the Hindus."""

In November, when potato seeds were to be supplied, demonetisation came. Farmers from West Bengal, which was the main market to be catered at the time, had no cash and the growers and suppliers here refused to sell on credit. Even according to conservative estimates, over four lakh bags (50kg per bag) were left in the stores in Punjab,"" said Inderdeep Singh Grewal, a major potato grower from Saraba village near Ludhiana. ""I too suffered big loss in November despite owning a cold storage,"" he added.""In November, several small growers had already sold most part of their produce and the middle and big producers were badly hit. However, this time, it's theses small growers who are worst hit as they sell their produce directly in the local mandis and don't have financial capacity to store,"" said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association.""Most of the trading of potato crops is done in cash. Now traders are wary of making all transactions through banks,"" Sangha said. ""People are worried as to how would they return the crops loans,"" he added.""In Jalandhar, farmers had to sell potato at Rs 2 to 3 per kg which did not even make up the cost incurred on producing it leave aside its transportation or other charges like labour,"" Sangha said. ""We are considering to launch some protest or agitation to expose that how demonetisation has hit the farmers,"" he added.Grewal pointed out that the last two - three seasons were good for potato and the area under the crop also increased. ""This time production is good and if things don't improve a major part of the produce would simply left to be rotten,"" he said.Kala Sanghia-based potato grower Gurminder Singh, a middle-level grower, said that farmers were now striving to recover their costs only and even that seems to be an uphill task.""We don't have any money to sow maize crop and have no money to pay the land owners whose lands we have taken on annual contract,"" said Nawan Pind-based small farmer Mandeep Singh. ""For us pangs of demonetisation are far from over,"" he added."
44,Old loyalties test note 'demon' anger,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170218/jsp/nation/story_136448.jsp,2017-02-18,Telegraph,"Workers at a potato farm in Kanpur Farrukhabad, Feb. 17: Sushil Kumar Dikshit says the demonetisation has wounded potato farmers like him but he and his fellow Brahmins would still vote for the BJP on Sunday. Yadav farmers see the November note recall as a ""demon"" but say they would have supported the Samajwadi Party even if the demonetisation never happened. Across central Uttar Pradesh constituencies that vote in the third phase on February 19, people seem agreed that the ""note bandi"" has hurt livelihoods. But how it might affect the Assembly polls is harder to assess, with caste and community leanings appearing to trump economic logic for many. Among the few dissenters is Mehboob Alam, a small-time building contractor from Kanpur district. He insists the note recall has changed the minds of many who would ordinarily have backed Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Had the note ban not happened, Modi would have formed the government in Uttar Pradesh. The demonetisation has upended his game,"" Alam, 52, said at Belaur market. Dikshit said he had lost a couple of lakhs of rupees this season because the note recall had left people without cash, worsening the effects of a bumper crop. ""Last season, I sold a sack of potato (weighing 52-55kg) for Rs 600-700; this season the price fell to Rs 150-200. I couldn't recover my input cost,"" the resident of Salempur, a village of ""Pandits"" in Farrukhabad, said. But he insisted that this would have no impact on votes. ""This time, all the Brahmins will vote for the BJP,"" Dikshit said, drawing vigorous nods all around. ""We had voted for Mayawati in 2007 and for the Samajwadis in 2012. But not this time, after the way Akhilesh has neglected Brahmins."" Most upper caste voters said they would support the BJP, as did most non-Yadav backward caste farmers, while acknowledging the distress caused by the demonetisation. ""We have suffered; we couldn't recover even the labour cost. But the note bandi will prove good for the country and for everybody in future,"" claimed Sujit Kumar Katiyar, a potato farmer. A rare exception was Anil Kumar Rajput, a landowning upper caste resident of Pasningpur village in Farrukhabad. His choice of Akhilesh, however, was driven more by the chief minister's performance than any anger at the demonetisation. ""Most members of our caste say they will vote for the BJP but I'll vote for Akhilesh. He has performed,"" Anil said. Akhilesh is banking on voters like Anil with his poll slogan of "" Kaam bolta hai (work talks)"". Most Rajputs and Thakurs, though, argued that while Akhilesh may be a good man, his party's district and block-level functionaries were knee deep in crime and corruption. The Rajputs and Brahmins see the BJP as their ""natural party"" that would serve their interests if it comes to power. Reminded that the BJP under Modi was trying to transform itself into a party of the poor and backward castes, Dharmnath Dubey of Naglabag village was dismissive: ""These things have to be done to win elections."" Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Mainpuri and Etawah are regarded as Samajwadi pocket boroughs but the Brahmins there are hopeful of ""our party"" coming to power after a long ""exile"". They are banking on the Muslim vote splitting between Mayawati and the Akhilesh-Rahul combine. ""In Farrukhabad, for instance, Mayawati has fielded a Muslim and the Samajwadis a Hindu. This should split Muslim votes. This is happening across the state,"" said Bhupendra Dwivedi in Farrukhabad town. The BJP vote too risks a division in Farrukhabad, though. Manoj Agrawal, a trader whom the BJP had denied a ticket, is contesting as an Independent. Many in the BJP feel that faulty candidate selection might cost the party."

The party hit back by accusing the Congress of patronising dreaded gangsters, including key accused of Nabha jailbreak.AAP state convener Gurpreet Singh Waraich alleged, ""It has become a habit for Punjab Congress president Capt Amarinder Singh to name AAP for any untoward incident in the state even though AAP has time and again made it clear that none of our leaders are involved in any kind of anti-social activity."" Waraich was accompanied by state secretary Gulshan Chhabra and co-coordinator of media cell Manjit Singh Sidhu.Waraich alleged, ""Gurpreet Sekhon, the key accused in Nabha jailbreak case belongs to a Congress family and Vicky Gounder, an accomplice of Sekhon, was brought into the world of crime by a Congress leader."" He said that family members of these gangsters were on record blaming the Congress for misguiding their wards. He refuted charges that any AAP leader had given shelter to gangsters, saying that no office-bearer of AAP were involved in harboring any criminal.He also attacked BJP state president Vijay Sampla for ""meaningless allegations"" and said that gangsters and terrorists in Punjab were products of the Congress and SAD. ""AAP will clear the mess,"" he added.Waraich expressed his concern over crash in potato prices and demanded that NAFED shall procure the potato produce through MARKFED to protect the interests of farmers. He also demanded that the Centre provide subsidy on freight to potato growers so that they could transport their yield to other states and even export it.AAP convener said that the SIT formed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to probe the remaining cases of 1984 genocide of Sikhs had proved an eyewash and was only used to give clean chit to criminals and political leaders. He said that Modi had formed SIT to preempt formation of SIT by AAP government in Delhi. Out of 59 cases picked by it chargesheet was filed in four cases and 38 cases were closed.Punjab AAP chief Gurpreet Singh Waraich said that the party was ""satisfied with the working of the Election Commission "" and congratulated the poll panel for peaceful conduct of elections. He, however, added that AAP had raised discrepancies at administrative level in Punjab and EC has rectified the problems. AAP workers were alert and would point out any lapse in the administration and security of strong rooms, he added."

(Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh) Leaving their farms behind at Rajoke village, Amritsar. (Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh)THE FARMERS of Punjab, who have been facing one crisis after the other for the past few years, are now facing indiscriminate increase in the rate of seeds of spring maize (February to May) and sunflower crops. In the absence of checks by any government agency, they are ending up paying double the amount to buy seeds for these crops. And, farmers have to depend only on dealers for the spring maize seed because the agriculture department provides the seed for Kharif season maize (June to October) only.Watch What Else Is Making NewsFarmers said that to increase rates, false shortage is being created by the seed dealers. Even some farmers groups have complained to the district administration and the agriculture department, which has issued instructions to check the availability of seed. Sunflower and spring maize crops are sown in February and March and harvested in June. We got an agreement with the dealers for getting the spring maize seed at the rate of Rs 1,200-1,400 per 4-kg bag (Rs 300-350 per kg) but farmers are being forced to pay Rs 2,100-2,200 (Rs 550 per kg) for the same quantity now as this will double our production amount, said farmer Jagat Parkash Singh Gill, secretary of Potato Seed Growers Association (PSGA), adding that they have lodged a complaint with the district administration, too.He also mentioned that dealers cartlised themselves to create a false shortage of the seed to charge hefty amount from the farmers. Prithpal Singh, another farmer and general secretary of PSGA, said that even the bills and invoice number are not provided by these dealers against the purchase of seed from them. He added that mostly hybrid seed is used for spring maize and that even the rates of the Cucurbit (Musakmelon, Watermelon etc.) has been hiked by the dealers. The rate of sunflower seed has also been increased from Rs 1,600 to Rs 2,600-3,000 per bag of four kilos, said farmers while making a representation.According to the agriculture department, around 30,000 hectares are ued for the cultivation of spring maize every year mostly in Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and part of Ludhiana districts. Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, joint director in the agriculture department, informed that they have asked the officials of these districts to check the stock available with the dealers. They have also been asked to send a report on seed availability with the dealers, he added.Chief Agriculture Officer, Jalandhar, Jugraj Singh, said that according to their report, there is no shortage of seeds of these crops in the market and they have informed their higher-ups about it. In Jalandhar alone, spring maize is cultivated over 10,000 hectares and sunflower on nearly 1,000 hectares.The farmers said that most of the potato growers of Doaba region, after harvesting the crop in February-March, switch to cultivating spring maize and sunflower crops, which are three-four months crops only.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The rate for storing one bag of produce (50kg) has gone up from Rs 80 to Rs 100 per bag in the past six months in Bathinda district. Now, the cold stores are asking farmers to pay Rs 20 per bag as advance too.The arrivals of fresh potato crop are expected to start in the first week of March. At present, potato is fetching a price of Rs 2 to 2.4 per kg with a 50 kg bag going for Rs 100-120.Bathinda has 35 cold storages with a capacity to stock up nearly 32 lakh bags of 50 kg each or around 1.6 lakh tonnes. Potato has been grown over 6,500 hectares in Bathinda and nearly 1.65 lakh tonnes of output of is expected in the district in the current season, which is the highest after the Doaba region.Though the state horticulture departments manages the potato cultivation, due to no minimum support price (MSP) it can't ensure higher rates from the market for the farmers. Even the rent of cold stores was fixed either under the Central Cold Storage Order, 1980, or the acts enacted by the state governments. Punjab had abolished the control on tariff fixation in 1994.""Earlier, demonetisation badly hit potato growers. With the cash flow diminishing from the market during November-December, the crop was not being sent to other states and farmers had to sell their produce in local markets at lower prices. The losses now mount further with the new crop also not fetching good rates and the cold store owners exploiting the growers,"" said Harcharan Singh Dhillon, a potato grower from Kararwala village near Rampura Phool sub-division of Bathinda. He has sown in potatoes over 200 acres. Rampura sub-division is the biggest producer of potatoes in the Malwa region.Another farmer from Kararwala Jaspal Singh said, ""The potato growers are failing to get bookings in the cold stores even after getting ready to pay more than the previous year. Most of the cold store owners are saying the space has already been booked by the traders."" He said the cold store owners had joined hands to make money by exploiting farmers.Bathinda-based Dhillon cold store owner Iqbal Singh Dhillon, however, denied any exploitation of the farmers. Iqbal said, ""Due to the hike in electricity rates, we are bound to make nominal increase in the storage rates. We are not saying no to any potato grower if we have space. Our cold store has the capacity of 80,000 bags. In the whole district, the cold stores have the capacity to store 30-32 lakh bags and nearly this much potato is produce already in the area.""Bathinda deputy director of horticulture Gurkewal Singh Dhillon also said that demonetisation had its impact on the crop and potato was not fetching the desired rates even now. ""We are taking up the issue with the cold store owners to get space for every farmer at reasonable rates.""The deputy director admitted that cold store owners had increased rates for storing potato. ""It seems tough for farmers to pay and we are trying to settle the issue,"" he said."

The Indian Express tracks the food from the kitchens to the students, and discovers some bumps along the wayA peppery aroma emanates from the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur, amid a sputtering of machines and flurry of human activity. On a Wednesday morning, nearly 70 men  supervisors, cooks, housekeeping staff and helpers  mop the 3,400 square yard area, load three 500 kg capacity steamers with potatoes, wash over 2,000 kg of rice, roll out 50,000 puris, temper over 800 kg of curry, and, finally, test the quality of food. On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools.We have 104 people and the second shift, which prepares meals for evening schools, is at work now. Between midnight and 5 pm, our kitchen prepares meals for 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schools, which is about 80,000 students, says Godfrey Pereira, the NGO secretary. His is one of the 43 NGOs that supply mid-day meals to 18.46 lakh children in Delhi schools, run or aided by the Directorate of Education, the north, east and south civic bodies, the New Delhi Municipal Council and the Delhi Cantonment Board.Unlike rural centres, there are no kitchen-cum-stores on school campuses in Delhi, primarily due to lack of space. All mid-day meals are prepared and delivered by NGOs, selected through a tender every three years Its a massive operation, and a small mistake at any of the levels  procuring, cleaning, cooking or serving  can have major repercussions, says Pereira, 58, whose NGO has been a part of the programme since 2003. Ye floor se paani saaf karo, Pereira instructs one of the helpers, pointing to the water that spread after rice was drained. He has just begun his rounds of the kitchen and will inspect all departments  grain clearing, cooking, vegetable cutting, dish washing, frying and storage areas  over the next few hours.On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools. On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools.The small mistake Pereira refers to is what could have led to dead rats slipping into mid-day meals served at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Deoli earlier this month. Nine students were hospitalised after consuming food provided by Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas, one of the 16 NGOs that supply mid-day meals to Delhi government schools. The incident prompted Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to ordered an inspection of 33 such kitchens by secretary-level officers.Pereira feels that though checks and balances are in place, an error can occur, or be introduced, at any stage, including after food has left the kitchen. You can never rule out sabotage. Its a competitive field and anyone who has lost out on the tender can bribe a driver or helper to spoil food, he says, checking the tempering of the potato curry. Jaldi karo, vans aane waali hongi, he says.Narender Singh, a member of the Suparbhat Education and Social Welfare Society, which supplies mid-day meals to 28 Delhi government schools, feels that problems run much deeper. While 43 NGOs get the contract to provide these meals, they end up sub-letting their duties to other organisations. In case of Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas, food was being provided by a third party. In such situations, monitoring quality becomes difficult, alleges Singh, whose NGO has been delivering meals since 2004. Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas refused to comment on the matter. Then there is the issue of training the staff. These third-party vendors simply hire daily wagers. The government must look into this, he adds.***Food being prepared at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur. Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal Food being prepared at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur. Express Photo by Tashi TobgyalThe mid-day meal scheme has been operational in Delhi for nearly 15 years now. A November 2001 Supreme Court order made it compulsory for all government and government-assisted primary schools to provide the meals. Two years later, the programme was first implemented in Delhi in 410 MCD schools, and in 2004, it was extended to primary classes of Sarvodaya schools, under the Directorate of Education. In October 2007, the scheme was revised to cover children in upper primary classes as well  VI to VIII.Since then, selected service providers have been supplying meals with a minimum of 450 calories and 12 gm of protein to children in Classes I-V, and with 700 calories and 20 gm of protein for students of Classes VI-VIII.Pereira, now checking the consistency of the kadhi in an 800 kg aluminium vessel, says that while NGOs try and stick to the calorific and protein requirements, the budget for meals is very low. We try and add ingredients such as soya chunks to meet the protein content, but apart from grains, which we get from the Food Corporation of India godowns, there is no subsidy on any ingredient and we pay market prices. We add seasonal vegetables, which are cheaper, but that is it. Spices, kidney beans, are expensive, he says, adding that the gas subsidy provided earlier has been taken away too. We use 90 cylinders a day; heating up large vessels requires a lot of fuel.The NGOs get Rs 4.13 and Rs 6.18 per child per day for primary and upper primary classes, respectively. The organisations also get Rs 1,000 per month for the cook-cum-helpers that serve meals at schools and for Rs 750 per metric ton for transportation. The cost for the entire programme is shared between the Centre and the state on a 60-40 basis.Narendra Singh, whose NGO supplies food to schools in northeast Delhi, also complains about delays in payments. We are yet to receive money for December. In such situations, many NGOs are likely to falter on quality, he says.So, will increasing the number of service providers help? Not at all, in fact it will increase bureaucracy and make monitoring even more difficult, says a member of another NGO, which supplies food to 44 schools in northwest Delhi. You need to empower existing organisations. Increase funding, expand infrastructure and workforce Provide raw material and verify the stock on a monthly basis.Pereira agrees. The problem is that we are not considered a part of the government. The moment there is an incident, such as the one at the Deoli school, there is a blame game, and all fingers are pointed at NGOs. But its only if the government and the NGOs work as a team that issues will be resolved, he says.***The food after being prepared at the the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen is taken to 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schools The food after being prepared at the the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen is taken to 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schoolsThis is not the first time that the Delhi mid-day meal programme has come under scrutiny. In 2013, an audit conducted by the Union HRD Ministry found that the meal served in schools in the capital did not meet prescribed nutritional values. About 95 per cent of 365 meal samples failed to meet nutritional requirements in 2011-2012, and 98 per cent of 322 samples failed in 2010-2011. Seventeen NGOs were found violating norms.Vimala Ramachandran, a former professor at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration, who has been part of several research projects on the subject, says, In cities, there is no space for kitchens on campus and that is where problems begin. Tamil Nadu is the best model where, except for Chennai, all food is prepared on campus. They dont rely on centralised kitchens (like the ones in Delhi). In Andhra Pradesh, sub-letting is not allowed. In Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Tripura, all grains come from the nearest public distribution system store, so it is all subsidised. Why cant other states follow this model, and link PDS or Kendriya Bhandars with mid-day meals?***Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis SultanpurOperations at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys kitchen have picked up pace. Four delivery vans have started queuing up at the entrance. Inside, cooks and helpers are putting final touches to the food. Hundreds of stainless steel vessels are being rinsed in potassium permanganate liquid and wiped, before food is packed in them. A few women are locking the vessels with a plastic seal.Hansika Rawat, a teacher from the Tughlakabad Extension government school, has arrived for inspection. Teachers from schools we supply meals too conduct inspections. We get three-four teachers a day, he says, directing one of his supervisors to show Rawat around. Following the inspection, teachers are expected to fill up a questionnaire with queries such as: Is there proper arrangement for drainage of waste water? and Are CCTVs installed in all the compartments?.Pereira appears confident. We follow all directions. I can monitor CCTV footage on my phone. It is a 24/7 kitchen and that is the first thing I do when I wake up at 5 am, he says.The vans take off on their journeys to schools, some as close as a kilometre away, others at least 6 km away. This is another problem. I dont supply food to the government school right next door, some other NGO does. Schools need to be allotted according to location of kitchens, he says.One of the schools Pereiras organisation provides food for is the South Delhi Municipal Corporation Primary Girls/Boys School, in Deoli, a kilometre away from the school where dead rats were found. Before children take their seats on durries in the corridor, a series of steps need to be followed: The room where food is served is mopped, then two cook-cum-helpers open seals of vessels in the presence of Ram Kumar Meena, the mid-may meal in-charge for the school, and then Meena, a few other teachers and two parents  who were there to speak to teachers about their wards  taste the aloo-puri. Following approvals, at around 3.20 pm, the cook-cum-helpers begin serving the meals to Class I students, who have brought their own bowls and plates. We send the food back if we feel it is spoiled. But then students suffer. It is difficult to prepare the meals again at such short notice. We give students biscuits, etc. on such days, says Meena.Soon, the conversation drifts towards the neighbouring school where dead rats were found. My eldest son studies in Class VI in that school and he loves the kadhi-chawal. But since the incident, I have been packing his lunch from home, says Indu Devi, 40, one of the parents tasting the meals.At the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Deoli, meals continue to be served by the same NGO. No one, apart from students, is allowed to enter the school. Principal sahab baat nahi karenge, says the guard through a small hole in the gate. A little after 3.30 pm, a few students scale the school wall and jump outside. One of them walks over to the general store and buys a packet of chips. I dont like the mid-day meals too much, says the Class VII student.Ask him about students who fell ill, and pat comes the reply: Yes, a few students were vomiting, but they werent from my class. Today kadhi-chawal is being served, but I will go home and eat, he says, walking away with his friends, all of whom have decided to give school a miss today.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
54,Veggie prices to soar from mid-March,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/veggie-prices-to-soar-from-mid-march/articleshow/57382114.cms,2017-02-27,The Times Of India,"JAIPUR: From March onwards, vegetable prices are likely to burn a hole in pockets of the homemakers. As local harvest of vegetables including tomatoes, chilli, lemon, coriander and bottle gourd is likely to go down, prices are likely to shoot up. Prices of vegetables are all time cheap since January due to extremely good local harvest. However, wholesale traders are expecting scarcity of vegetables as local harvest gets exhausted from March.Presently, homemakers are enjoying vegetable shopping as prices remained cheaper in January and February. Tomatoes in wholesale are priced at Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg where as it is selling at Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg in retail market. Onion, which usually brings tears in eyes of the common man, is sold in Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg in the wholesale while its retail market value is Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg.""From mid-March when local harvest of these crops would be finished, there is going to be trouble. From this period, we would be dependent on Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for vegetables and thus supply would be less which will add to the price rise. We are expecting a rise of 15 percent to 25 percent in vegetable price from mid-March,"" said Abdul Aziz, a wholesale dealer of fruits and vegetables at Mohana Mandi which supplies major chunk of vegetables in the city.According to sources, traders are also into hoarding of onions, potatoes and ginger sensing the upcoming scarcity.""We got bumper crop this time from Bassi, Kanota, Chommu, Chandwaji, Dudu and other nearby villages due to which the prices of vegetables were cheaper compared to last three years. Now, when local crop would be exhausted due to supply from mid-March , prices would be high. I think, prices of onion, potato, tomato, ginger, bottle gourd, pea, chilli and lemon would be affected,"" said Sadiq Ahamed, another wholesale trader at Mohana Mandi.Wholesale traders are expecting rise in vegetable prices from mid-March onwards. ""The season for peas would be over by then and we will have to get cold storage stuff for customers which would be selling at Rs 35 to Rs 45 in wholesale and Rs 45 to Rs 50 in retail markets,"" said Nanak Ram Saini, a wholesale trader of tomato and pea in Mohana Mandi."

However, the dip is not reflecting in the Kolkata markets, with prices ranging between Rs 7 and Rs 9. So essentially, due to meddling by middlemen, potato retail price turns five times dearer while covering 60-odd kilometres from the farm to buyer.Sensing an imminent crisis, the Bengal government is set to offer minimum support price to potato farmers in the state to stop distress sale of the food crop. The department of agriculture marketing has asked 460 potato cold storages to keep 10% space reserved for government-procured potatoes.According to the agriculture marketing department, this year, a bumper potato harvest is expected in three major potato producing districts  Hooghly, Burdwan and Bankura and some blocks of other districts. The potato production, this year is pegged at 1.15 crore tonne in 4,500 hectres of land, compared to 90 lakh per tonne last year. A bumper production often leads to distress sale by farmers who fear rotting of the unsold crop in the field.According to the notification (245-AM/0/4C-05/2013) dated February 23, 2017, issued by the agriculture marketing department secretary R K Sinha, on the basis of the advise of cold storage expert committee, all cold storages were instructed to reserve 10% potato storage space for government-procured potatoes. This space will be at the disposal of the district magistrate till March 21. Significantly, the cold storage will be opened on March 1, 2017, for stocking of the potato of Rabi season.Both farmers and cold storage owners welcome this move. Chintamoni Santra of Pursura, the country's highest potato producing block, said, ""This year, I had potato-farming in 1.5 bigha land, which produces 90 packets per bigha. But I had to sell some of the produce at Rs 80-Rs 100 per packet, incurring a loss of almost Rs 100 per packet. If the government buys out some part of the produce, I will be relived of a huge stress.""Bengal's agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said: ""Our chief minister Mamata Banerjee has said farmers must not suffer and middlemen must not loot. This is why we are adopting such measures without disturbing the market equilibrium. Each Panchayat will prepare a list of potato farmers in potato producing districts.""Arijit Saha, the owner of Dhanekhali Cold Storage, feels positive about the decision. ""This will save the potato market to a great extent. A lot of farmers will have a breather. But the Panchayat must prepare the list of potato farmers on a war-footing."""

(Photo | AP)BAGHDAD: Since Iraqi government forces launched the push to take the western half of Mosul from the Islamic State group last week, about 8,000 people have fled from that part of the city and surrounding villages, the U.N. humanitarian aid agency said Tuesday.The agency, known as OCHA, said it is expanding displacement camps to cope with the increasing numbers of those fleeing Mosul.With the support of the U.S.-led coalition, Iraqi forces began the operation to retake western Mosul on Feb. 19, and have so far captured the city's international airport and a sprawling military base next to it as well some neighbourhoods from the southern edge. Iraq declared eastern Mosul ""fully liberated"" in January, after three months of fierce fighting.The people fleeing western Mosul are ""often exhausted and dehydrated,"" the OCHA statement said, adding that an estimated 250,000 people could flee the fighting in the coming days.It also noted ""high"" trauma casualty rates from western Mosul, with at least 75 civilians treated near the front lines over the past week and warned the situation for the estimated 750,000 civilians remaining in western Mosul ""is desperate"" as supply lines have been cut off, in particular, the highway from Mosul into neighboring Syria.Citing eyewitness accounts, OCHA said civilians still in western Mosul are enduing shortages of everything  from food and water to gas, heating oil and medical supplies. The prices of staples such sugar and potatoes have gone up.Associated Press footage from the village of al-Salam south-west of the Mosul airport shows hundreds of civilians trickling to a gathering point in an open and dusty area, carrying a few of their possessions in bags. Security forces separate the men from the women and children before they are taken away in buses and military pickup trucks.Meanwhile, Iraqi special forces moved into western Mosul's Shuhada neighbourhood amid fierce clashes with IS militants as federal police units continued clearing up Gawsaq, a neighbourhood retaken on Monday from IS, according to special forces and police officers.A mortar round landed in one of the streets, killing three civilians and wounding a fourth, another police officer said, as security forces scrambled to try and evacuate civilians to safe areas. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to reporters.The offensive to capture Mosul is the biggest military operation in Iraq since American troops left in 2011. Iraq's second-largest city has been under IS rule for more than two years and remains the Islamic State group's last urban stronghold in Iraq."

Interestingly, unlike in the jallikattu agitation held in Marina, leaders of various political parties have started flocking to the venue after the tenth day, perhaps after testing the waters. MDMK general secretary Vaiko, leaders of People's Welfare Front and TNCC chief S Thirunavukarasar were among those who called on the protesters on Tuesday expressing their concern at the possible impact of the project on the environment.As per the resolutions passed at the protest committee meeting on Monday, protesters held black flags in their hands on Tuesday at Neduvasal. Villagers from Neduvasal West and Aandavarayapuram joined the protest along with hundreds of farmers, students and youths who came from various districts. Meanwhile, residents of 70 surrounding villages including Neduvasal (East and West), Karukakuruchi, Kottaikadu, Vadakadu, Aandavarayapuram, Pullanviduthi and Vaanakkankadu hoisted black flag atop their houses to showcase their resistance. As many as 500 members from the jamath committee in Pudukkottai also expressed their solidarity with the protesters by staying put for a whole day at the venue.Address the gathering, MDMK general secretary Vaiko said that development of the country at the cost of Tamil Nadu was not acceptable and people would protest against the hydrocarbon project. ""Nigeria bore the brunt of hydrocarbon and people opposed it after sensing catastrophe. Now it's our turn. If the union government wants the project, they may have it in Gujarat. I urge chief minister Edapadi K Palanisamy to take strong exception to the project"", Vaiko added.Leaders of People's Welfare Front (PWF) Thol Thirumavalavan, G Ramakrishnan and R Mutharasan, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president S Thirunavukarasar and director V Gowthaman who also addressed the gathering said that the Centre should not compel farmers to accept the project. Otherwise they warned of holding a statewide protest. While addressing a protest organized by PWF at Alangudi in Pudukkottai district, the leaders asked the union government to respect the people's feelings and revoke the project.Meanwhile, college students from Mannar Sarfoji in Thanjavur skipped their classes and staged a demonstration raising slogans against the hydrocarbon project. As usual, Neduvasal villagers prepared and served tasty sambar rice with potato curry, roasted green chilli and pickle to the protesters. As announced, traders will down their shutters across the district on Wednesday in support of the ongoing protest."

There are 500 cold storages in Punjab, with a combined capacity of 25 lakh tonne.Seeing the plight of farmers, the state government had asked deputy commissioners to ensure cold storage owners dont fleece them."
59,Cropping patterns: Diversification dilemma on the ground,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/cropping-patterns-diversification-dilemma-on-the-ground-farmers-punjab-agriculture-4550138/,2017-03-01,Indian Express,"Farmers at a spring maize field in Thammanwal village in Phillaur, Punjab. Anju Chaba Agnihotri Farmers at a spring maize field in Thammanwal village in Phillaur, Punjab. Anju Chaba AgnihotriCrop diversification and moving away from the entrenched paddy-wheat cycle has been the buzzword among Punjabs policymakers for at least two decades now. It will remain so even when the next government takes over in a couple of weeks time. But on the ground, farmers are still planting paddy during kharif and wheat in the rabi season as before. Some have gone in for diversification, but not the way policymakers, both in the state government and the Centre, would want them to. Theres no better example of this diversification dilemma than spring season maize; and it should be an eye-opener for future policymaking.Spring maize is currently being grown in about 30,000 hectares of Punjab, especially in the Doaba region covering Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts that also constitutes the states potato belt. It is planted from mid-February to mid-March, just after harvesting of potato. Spring maizes popularity is precisely because it fits well into the potato cycle. A 95-110 day crop, it is harvested by June, well in time for planting of basmati/non-basmati paddy or even kharif maize. The latter crops are harvested in October, which is also potato planting time.The above cropping cycle, however, is not viewed favourably by the authorities, who feel it doesnt address the more fundamental problem of depleting water tables in the state. The Punjab government wants farmers to grow maize only in the kharif reason to replace water-guzzling paddy. We arent keen to promote spring season maize, as it also consumes too much water, says Jasbir Singh Bains, joint director of the state agriculture department.A senior scientist at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in Ludhiana, too, seconds this view: Temperatures start rising after March and hit 35-45 degrees Celsius level by May-June alongside sunshine duration of 9-9.5 hours. This necessitates frequent watering of the standing maize crop. As an alternative, the government is encouraging farmers to grow spring/summer moong (green gram), mah/urad (black gram), sunflower, vegetables (cucumber, brinjal, capsicum, gourds, beans, etc) and green fodder  which can all be planted in February.But there are no takers for this logic amongst farmers. Why should we grow maize during the kharif season when its yields are not even 25 quintals per acre? We get 36-39 quintals or more from spring maize hybrids. And with rates of Rs 1,000-1,500 per quintal, the returns are more than even from wheat, taking 24-25 quintal/acre yield, minimum support price of Rs 1,625/quintal and 145-day crop duration, points out Jagat Prakash Gill, secretary of the Potato Seed Growers Association who cultivates spring maize of 70 out of his 100 acres land at Thammanwal village in Jalandhars Phillaur tehsil.We prefer spring maize since it is high-yielding, has shorter duration and there is good demand in the market from poultry and animal feed makers. If the government wants us to grow kharif maize, why are PAU and others not developing hybrids that yield close to what we get from the spring-planted crop? Alternatively, why dont they breed spring maize hybrids requiring less water? asks Gurraj Singh. This farmer, who cultivates spring maize on 20 out of his 25-acre holding in Jugral village of Jalandhar tehsil, also points to the Indian Institute of Maize Research, which is being shifted from Delhi to Ladhowal, not far from Phillaur: What are the people there doing to help us?This disconnect between policymakers objectives and farmers preferences has meant that the market for spring maize hybrid seeds is today controlled by private firms. The most popular hybrids in Punjab include DKC 9108 and 9120 of Monsanto and Dupont-Pioneers P1844, P1855 and 31Y45. The biggest grouse of farmers has to do with their prices, which are totally unregulated. Till a couple of years ago, these branded seeds were being sold to farmers at Rs 150-200 per kg. This season, their rates were in the Rs 525-550 per kg range. At 8 kg seeds per acre, it translates into a cost of Rs 4,200-4,400.The distributors/dealers of the seed companies promised us a rate of Rs 1,300-1,400 per bag of 4 kg in early-January. But when sowing began, we ended up paying Rs 2,100-2,200, which was above even the maximum retail price mentioned in the bags. After much hue and cry, they reduced the rates to Rs 1,600-1,700. But by then, much of the seeds had already been sold, complains Arvinder Singh, a 50-acre farmer from Sofi Pind village of Jalandhar who grows spring maize on 40 acres. He further alleges that the dealers did not even provide bills or invoices against their sales.When asked about these seemingly anti-competitive pricing practices, the spokesperson of one of the multinational firms told The Indian Express that we made the seeds available to the dealers at Rs 1,525-1,550 per bag and there was no shortage of material supplied from our end. He, however, admitted that we have no control on our distributors. Equally interesting is the response of the government, which has chosen to be a mute spectator, conveniently citing that it is committed to regulate prices and supply of only kharif season maize seeds. Its another matter that farmers arent interested in growing kharif maize. As a result, they are left with no choice but to deal with private sector monopolies and unscrupulous dealers who have exploited the demand for seeds to jack up prices. The government wants us to grow pulses and sunflower. But we have seen the way moong prices have collapsed within the last one year. For maize, there is at least a market and no lack of buyers, notes Jagat Prakash Gill.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is lending support to the Swadeshi cause as well, albeit in his style.Addressing a poll rally in Manipur on Tuesday, the Congress leader, making a pitch for a food-processing unit, said,Here (in Manipur) you grow nimbu (lemon), narangi (orange), pineapple I hope that a day comes when someone in London drinks pineapple juice, and sees Made in Manipur on the box.Earlier, several news outlets, including Hindustan Times, erroneously quoted Gandhi as referring to coconuts instead of pineapples. Coconuts do not grow in Manipur, pineapples do.The northeastern state votes for a new assembly in two phases -- on March 4 and 8.By the time the mistake was realised, Gandhis comment had triggered several jokes on social media. This, however, was not the first time that the 46-year-old Amethi MPs ideas on boosting industry have caused mirth.February 8 (Ghaziabad): Speaking at a rally, Gandhi said, I want to see the day when bed sheet used in Barack Obamas house will have Made in Uttar Pradesh mark.The Congress leader also criticised the Prime Minister for failing to deliver the promised achche din (good days). He said the promise has come true only for industrialists as the countrys farmers continue to face burey din (bad days).The Congress has often accused the government of following pro-industry and anti-farmer policies.Ghazibad, which has a thriving steel and dyeing industry, was one of the 73 constituencies that voted on February 11, the first of the seven phases of polling for the UP state assembly.February 17 (Rae Bareli): The Congress leader again used the governments ambitious Make in India programme to hit out at the Prime Minister at a poll meeting in Rae Bareli, saying we only see Made in China on everything.Sister Priyanka by his side, Gandhi went on to explain, It is because our PM only listens to 50 corporate families in India and he has helped Vijay Mallya escape and collectively waived off six lakh crore loan for his corporate friends.The PM, he said, could have helped with some money in setting up food-processing plants in the area. I want to see Made in Rae Bareli on packaged products one day, Gandhi said.Rae Bareli, which has five assembly segments, is the Lok Sabha constituency of his mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Rae Bareli voted on February 23.October 1, 2016 (Firozabad): Addressing a gathering of farmers in Uttar Pradeshs Firozabad, Gandhi said he ask the government to set up a potato factory. This was in reply to villager asking him to set up a potato chips factory so that they would be able to get a good price for their crop.Gandhi had told the farmers: You all are demanding a potato factory in your area, but you should understand I am an opposition leader. I can put pressure on the government, but cannot take the decision. I cannot open a potato factory for farmers.March 6, 2014 (Mirzapur): Addressing a rally in the carpet-manufacturing belt of Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi said he wanted the American president to one day wear a wrist watch bearing Made in Mirzapur tag.I want to see a day when the American president is asked: Bhaiya, what is the time? He looks at his watch and on it is written Made in Mirzapur. He then asks his people: Where is this Mirzapur? These youth of Mirzapur are snatching jobs from American youth. Where is this place? sources quoted Gandhi as saying.."

Another group comprising 200 women from villages in Thane and Aurangabad  called the control group  were not provided with the dryers.Developed by S4S, the electricity-free solar-powered food dehydrator uses controlled radiation technology to trap the infrared rays that dry fruits and vegetables. The dehydrated products regain their original properties when put in water. Every year, 25%-30% of the 250 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables produced in India are lost.Undernutrition or malnutrition is intergenerational. It passes from a mother to her children, said Vaibhav Tidke, chief executive officer, S4S. Undernourishment is attributed to poverty, which results in poor ability to buy food and maintain dietary variations, food shortage across off-seasons when agri-products are not available on farms, gender inequality as women are not equipped to buy and supply nutritional food, and poor feeding practices that rely on staple food as major component of diet.Electricity-free solar-powered food dehydrators use controlled radiation technology to trap the infrared rays that dry fruits and vegetables. (HT Photo)The women were trained to use the dryers to dehydrate onions, fenugreek, spinach, dried ginger, mangoes and papaya. These dehydrated products were integrated in their daily diet, especially during the lean season  January to June  when fresh produce is not available for consumption.The fact that vegetables were ready to be consumed during the lean season increased the Dietary Diversity Score  amount of nutrients in ones diet  in the experimental group by 37% more than the control group.During the lean season, women end up eating starchy food. They boil potatoes with salt and some spice; all of which has no nutrition, said Tidke. Dehydrating locally available seasonal food and cooking it improved the womens haemoglobin count by an average of one point  from 8g/dL to 9g/dL, for instance, he added.With the dryer reducing moisture content in agri-animal produce and maintaining nutritional values, women farmers and rural women can preserve seasonal produce for six months to a year, without using chemicals.When vegetables, fruits or any agricultural products are dehydrated, there is a less-than-5% loss in minerals and protein activity owing to the controlled temperature increase during the drying process. The concentration of nutrients, vitamins and protein activity is increased by almost five times owing to the removal of water. Hence, the net gain is enormous, said Bhaskar Thorat,head, chemical engineering department, ICT, and advisor for S4S. This concentration increases energy levels and improves haemoglobin levels, he added.In addition to consuming the dried product and preventing wastage, the women also sold the surplus. Of the 200 women in the experimental group, 105 sold the surplus dehydrated food  approximately 20,000kg of agricultural products.With more than Rs10 lakh in proceeds, the consumption of dehydrated vegetables and fruits helped the women save Rs40 to Rs60 a week during the lean season.The team plans to write to the state women and child welfare and tribal departments with the proposal to introduce solar conduction dryers in villages.There needs to be a policy intervention in terms of installing solar dryers at the panchayat levels, said Tidke.The two-year project was executed by S4S, Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai and Hyderabad-based National Institute of Nutrition. It is supported by the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (Department of Biotechnology), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and USAIDThe solar conduction dryer is a patented technology recognised by the UN, USAID, UKAID, FICCI and University of Texas. It costs three to five times less than other solar dryers and processes 1 tonne material annually.ReadMalnutrition: Pay attention to the Palghars within MumbaiOver 254 children died of malnutrition in Palghar district: Maharashtra CMMalnutrition deaths of tribal children return to haunt Maharashtra"

(Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Financial commissioner, development, NS Kalsi, who is in charge of the agriculture department, said the landing cost of potato in the two countries will be Rs 18 per kilogram, while it will sell for Rs 50 to Rs 60 per kilogram.The profit will be passed on to the farmers. The corporation has sought Rs 5-crore financial help from the government to start lifting the produce from farmers, he said.Bharatiya Kisan Union president Balbir Singh Rajewal said area under potato has been expanding and this season an alltime high of one lakh hectare was under potato cultivation, with 25-lakh tonne production expected.Last season, the area under potato cultivation stood at 70,000-80,000 hectares.Although the quantum of export is negligible as compared to the total production, it will give a fillip to the trade, he said.He, however, questioned the delay in listening to the farmers, who had to bear heavy losses, and suggested export of the produce should be made a regular exercise.Jalandhar potato growers association general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha said big growers have offered their produce for export for free and the income generated by the corporation could be passed on to farmers after recovery of payments from the foreign buyers. To help small farmers, we have offered to lift their produce at Rs 4 to Rs 5 a kilogram, he said.WHY PRICES CRASHEDFollowing the Centres demonetisation move, traders stopped lifting the produce. Seeing the drop in demand, cold storage owners refused to stock the crop.If farmers are not able to sell their produce, they will not be in position to pay for the storage charges, reasoned a cold storage owner. There are 500 cold storages in Punjab, with a combined capacity of 25 lakh tonne.Seeing the plight of farmers, the state government had asked deputy commissioners to ensure cold storage owners dont fleece them."

This led to blockade on the NH as vehicles were finding it difficult to negotiate through crushed potatoes. Later, the administration cleared the road with JCB machines.Farmers also blocked Kartarpur-Kapurthala road and raised slogans against the Union government. They raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and termed him anti-farmer. The farmers were led by Union patron Pooran Singh Shahkot and president Harmeet Singh Qadian.They said that while potato crop was going waste, the seeds for next maize crop had been made expensive. They also opposed giving out river waters from Punjab saying state was already grappling with water crisis as underground water table had severely depleted."
64,How Uttar Pradesh is split down its middle,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/how-uttar-pradesh-is-split-down-its-middle/articleshow/57405870.cms,2017-03-01,The Times Of India,"The last two phases in UP are gearing up to vote in what has been a bitterly fought 7-phase Assembly elections. Polling started in west UP almost three weeks ago. Although bound by politics and administration, east and west UP are vastly different in history and culture. But the biggest difference is of economic development.The per person income (domestic product) of west UP is a stunning 76 % higher than that of east UP. Urbanisation is almost three times, number of factories are seven times more, 20% more land is irrigated, every hectare of land yields 24% more food grains, 48% more potatoes and 76% more oilseeds, and power consumption per person is more than double in the west compared to east.The UP government defines west UP as 28 districts from Saharanpur to AuraiyaEtawah and east UP as 30 districts from Bahraich in the north-west to Sonabhadra in the southeast corner. Population sizes are not too different and literacy rates are similar. But here the similarity ends.The most striking difference between the two regions is in industrialisation. There are nearly 13 registered working factories per one lakh population in the west com pared to just about 2 in the east. As a result, the number of industrial employees per lakh population is 812 per lakh population in west, not a very high figure but over eight times the figure for east.A key difference is of land holding size. For every rural resident in west UP, 0.12 hectares of land is sown for cultivation. In east UP this measure plummets to just 0.08 hectares per rural person. This means that agriculture in east UP bears the burden of one and a half times more people than in west UP. Over 86% of land in east UP is cultivated by small and marginal farmers with less than a hectare of land, compared to 74% in the west.""Feudal stranglehold survived in east UP till very late and its remnants are entrenched even today,"" says DM Diwakar, a Patna-based academic who has extensively researched east-west UP differences. ""In the west land relations were different and hence development has been different.""Diwakar also stresses that west UP saw the Green Revolution which boosted production and further changed the agrarian structure while east UP continued to grind under traditional cultivation and landlordism.Huge investment in agriculture spurred industrial growth and urbanisation in the west but the east remained frozen, he said.""If effective land reforms had been implemented, east UP would have changed,"" Diwakar asserted.This chasm reflects in political and electoral processes too. The more homogenous east UP has flipped through the three big political parties -SP, BSP and BJP -in the last three elections showing a deep urge to change things.West UP has become an intense battleground with SP and BSP sharing the spoils in previous Assembly elections and BJP sweeping the Lok Sabha elections, as it did elsewhere in the state."

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is lending support to the Swadeshi cause as well, albeit in his style.Addressing a poll rally in Manipur on Tuesday, the Congress leader, making a pitch for a food-processing unit, said,Here (in Manipur) you grow nimbu (lemon), narangi (orange), pineapple I hope that a day comes when someone in London drinks pineapple juice, and sees Made in Manipur on the box.Earlier, several news outlets, including Hindustan Times, erroneously quoted Gandhi as referring to coconuts instead of pineapples. Coconuts do not grow in Manipur, pineapples do.The northeastern state votes for a new assembly in two phases -- on March 4 and 8.By the time the mistake was realised, Gandhis comment had triggered several jokes on social media. This, however, was not the first time that the 46-year-old Amethi MPs ideas on boosting industry have caused mirth.February 8 (Ghaziabad): Speaking at a rally, Gandhi said, I want to see the day when bed sheet used in Barack Obamas house will have Made in Uttar Pradesh mark.The Congress leader also criticised the Prime Minister for failing to deliver the promised achche din (good days). He said the promise has come true only for industrialists as the countrys farmers continue to face burey din (bad days).The Congress has often accused the government of following pro-industry and anti-farmer policies.Ghazibad, which has a thriving steel and dyeing industry, was one of the 73 constituencies that voted on February 11, the first of the seven phases of polling for the UP state assembly.February 17 (Rae Bareli): The Congress leader again used the governments ambitious Make in India programme to hit out at the Prime Minister at a poll meeting in Rae Bareli, saying we only see Made in China on everything.Sister Priyanka by his side, Gandhi went on to explain, It is because our PM only listens to 50 corporate families in India and he has helped Vijay Mallya escape and collectively waived off six lakh crore loan for his corporate friends.The PM, he said, could have helped with some money in setting up food-processing plants in the area. I want to see Made in Rae Bareli on packaged products one day, Gandhi said.Rae Bareli, which has five assembly segments, is the Lok Sabha constituency of his mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Rae Bareli voted on February 23.October 1, 2016 (Firozabad): Addressing a gathering of farmers in Uttar Pradeshs Firozabad, Gandhi said he ask the government to set up a potato factory. This was in reply to villager asking him to set up a potato chips factory so that they would be able to get a good price for their crop.Gandhi had told the farmers: You all are demanding a potato factory in your area, but you should understand I am an opposition leader. I can put pressure on the government, but cannot take the decision. I cannot open a potato factory for farmers.March 6, 2014 (Mirzapur): Addressing a rally in the carpet-manufacturing belt of Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi said he wanted the American president to one day wear a wrist watch bearing Made in Mirzapur tag.I want to see a day when the American president is asked: Bhaiya, what is the time? He looks at his watch and on it is written Made in Mirzapur. He then asks his people: Where is this Mirzapur? These youth of Mirzapur are snatching jobs from American youth. Where is this place? sources quoted Gandhi as saying.."
66,Dip in potato prices hits Assam farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170302/jsp/northeast/story_138468.jsp,2017-03-02,Telegraph,"Bongaigaon/Nagaon, March 1: Potato farmers at Mandia in lower Assam's Barpeta district are facing losses because they are not able to get good prices for their produce. The farmers said they spend nearly Rs 22,000 to cultivate potatoes in a bigha of land but are unable to get good returns. Social worker Chand Mamud said prices have gone down to Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg and farmers have no option but to sell their produce at low prices owing to lack of cold storage facilities. The farmers cannot sell them in the district headquarters markets either as cost of transportation is high. Mandia is the potato hub in the district, where 98 per cent farmers grow the tuber. The village, having a population over 3,500, is 10km southwest of the Barpeta district headquarters. Farmers in the village buy potato seeds, fertilizers and pesticides at high prices to grow the crop commercially. Most of them even take loans from private lenders at high interest. The village also lacks irrigation facility and due to which the farmers have to spend money to irrigate their potato fields. Prices of potato at Barpeta Road market varies between Rs 5 to Rs 10 a kilo as traders brings them from Nainital and Bengal. The production in the state has gone up since the agriculture department started distribution of the Kufri Jyoti potato variety for free from 2001 to 2014. ""This year, less rainfall in the winter helped potato production, said senior department officer Dipok Tamuli. Nagaon, Morigaon, Sonitpur, Biswanath Chariali, Barpeta and Darrang are the main potato growing districts in Assam. Agriculture department officials said abundance of quality seeds, coupled with favourable weather are the two main reasons for increase in production of potato in the state. ""Productivity of Pukhraj variety of seeds is almost double and that results maximum potato production,"" said Tamuli. The agriculture department distributed 20,924 quintals of Pukhraj and 1,860 quintals of Khyati variety of seeds among farmers this year. Both the varieties are from Punjab and known as short-duration, disease-resistant and cold-tolerant varieties. ""These varieties could be harvested in 100 days so farmers could opt for another crop assoon as the potato is harvested. Productivity is 15 to 20 times of the seed,"" said Seed Corporation of India managing director, M.P. Rownier."
67,Dirt-cheap crop a hot potato for Punjab farmers,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/mar/02/dirt-cheap-crop-a-hot-potato-for-punjab-farmers-1576428.html,2017-03-02,The New Indian Express,"CHANDIGARH: When it comes to potatoes, Punjab faces a problem of plenty. Unable to sell their produce, angry farmers in the Doaba region have dumped 500 quintals of potato on the road, causing a traffic jam on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway.The Punjab government had asked Markfed and National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) to procure the potato crop, but they had failed to do so. So, we dumped about 500 quintals of potatoes on the main chowk in Kartarpur on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway, said Harmeet Singh Kadian, State president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.The trouble began in November when farmers from Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat cancelled their orders for potato seeds from Punjab because demonetisation ensured they could not pay for it.Usually, Punjab farmers sell around 200 quintals of potato seed at the rate of `3,000 per quintal. This time, the losses are estimated at Rs 1,500 crore. Many farmers, who waited for the prices to stabilise, left their crops standing in the field. But then the new crop came in February, adding to the standing stock and a lot of unsold potatoes already kept in cold storage.Post-demonetisation and the coming of the new crop, there has been a crash in potato prices. Now, potatoes are selling at Rs 1.50 to Rs 2 per kg compared to Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg earlier, said J S Sangha, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary.Farmers should dump the potato outside banks if the government doesnt support them in anyway. The crop dumped yesterday was just a trailer. We will dump the whole crop across the State, as storing it in cold storage costs us much more.In an attempt to resolve the crisis, the Punjab government is now trying to export the crop to Russia and Iran."

70,Bengal opens farm trade,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170303/jsp/bengal/story_138748.jsp,2017-03-03,Telegraph,"Calcutta, March 2: The Mamata Banerjee government today amended the agriculture produce marketing act to allow the entry of major private players in the trade so that better prices were ensured for commodities produced by farmers. But senior bureaucrats said the measure would work if the state's opposition to policies like contract farming was reconsidered. In the amendment passed in the Assembly, the government has made it clear that any company could trade in agriculture produces by securing a single licence, which can be obtained from Calcutta. As of now, the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1972, prevents a company from doing business freely as it needs to obtain licences separately for more than 300 regulated markets in the state. ""The amendment will make the trade in the agriculture produce sector easy for any agency. A bigger market will be opened for farmers,"" said agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta. But senior officials feel opening the market for major private players would not help farmers realise proper price. ""Opening the market for major players is a good move but some other steps like allowing contract farming is required to make things happen for farmers,"" said a senior Nabanna official, who added that major private players needed agriculture produces of certain quality and variety for their business. For example, the official explained, multinational companies, which make potato chips, need chipsona variety. ""Bengal is a major producer of potato... But it produces mainly table variety of potato, which would not attract multinational companies here even if the procedure of doing business is made easy,"" the official added. Bengal produces a large quantity of jyoti variety, known as the table variety and not used by food processing units. The farmers face a lot of troubles in realising prices for rice and potato, two major agriculture produces in the state. In case of rice, Bengal produces common varieties but private players need special aroma rice, which could be produced if contract farming is allowed. ""Farmers would get seeds and fertiliser from agencies and a secured buyer for their produces if contract farming is allowed. If the markets don't have enough quality produce, no company would enter the trade. So, making the market useful for private players is equally important,"" said an agriculture department official. A section of officials, however, said there was a silver line in the horizon after the government prepared a policy to allow private players to go for an indirect form of contract farming in the horticulture sector. ""According to the plan, the private players have to sign contract with the farmers' co-operatives, not an individual farmer, for produces like flower and some vegetables. This gives us hope that the government could rethink its policy of not allowing contract farming in the state,"" said an official."

These are expected to be completed by March, 2018.Official sources said there is hadly any response from private promoters to set up cold stores in tribal-dominated backward districts despite huge subsidy offered by the Government. While the subsidy for new cold stores in plain area is 55 per cent of the project cost subject to a maximum limit of Rs 2.20 lakh, the subsidy amount is Rs 2.80 lakh for scheduled areas.Under the mission, the State Government had planned to bring about 60,000 hectares under potato cultivation to achieve a production of about 11.25 lakh tonnes and 1.42 lakh tonnes of seed potato by 2017-18. However, the area coverage under potato cultivation has been marginally over 25,000 hectares in 2016-17.Referring to a survey conducted by National Centre for Cold-chain Development (NCCD) and NABARD Consultancy Services (NABCONS), the Minister said the State required additional cold store capacity of 2.88 lakh tonnes.In a bid to raise vegetable production in the State, the Government had decided in 2015 to set up 150 new cold stores under PPP mode by 2019. Though the decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, there is hardly any progress due to lack of response from private partners, the sources added."

BSP chief Mayawati during an election rally.Time: 12.45 pmPlace: Inter College ground, Jagatpur, VaranasiMayawatis rally was scheduled for 1 pm, but her audience had started to come in from 10 am. Thousands of them, mostly from the eight assembly segments that make up the Prime Ministers Lok Sabha constituency, all voting in the final phase of the elections on March 8.They came on three wheelers, buses and tempos, and filled the venue in a slow, orderly fashion. Many said they were given food and transport by local village leaders.The election rallies of the BSP leader are like no other in Uttar Pradesh. They are attended by those at the very bottom of the caste and economic pyramid, and are filled with vivid images of the inequalities that lie at the heart of her Dalit politics. Of the 25,000-plus people  including over 8,000 women  at Saturdays rally, perhaps not even a hundred could be called middle class or upper class.The women were in brightly coloured synthetic saris  mostly made in Surat  paired with plastic or synthetic rubber shoes, sandals or chappals. All, old and young, wore metal jewellery with a fake silver or gold shine. Some, both men and women, munched on chana or moongfali in 50-paise packets, or a fried mixture that cost Re 1. There was drinking water  not clean  in loose plastic bags, and a vendor sold colourful icecream of a brand called Madhu. There were no public toilets anywhere near the venue.Over an hour past the scheduled time, there is no sign of Behen Kumari Mayawati. But there are no complaints, no restlessness, not even a murmur in the huge crowd. From the stage, slogans reverberate: Chalo chalein sarkar banayein, haathi wala button dabayein, BSP ki kya pehchaan, neela jhanda, haathi nishaan.Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo) Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo)It is 30 degrees, and directly in the sun sits Ravita Kumari, a 23-year-old mother of two children. She has come to listen to Mayawati with Jeevati Devi, Nirmala and Phoolmati from Jagdishpur. He husband Chhotelal, she says, has studied computtery, and has a mobile shop.Asked if she didnt feel warm in her synthetic sari, Ravita said, Hum chhoti jaat hain, suti (cotton) bahut mehenga hai.How much money does your husband give you every month?Kuchho nahin (Nothing). Rs 5 for Lifebuoy soap, a small tikiya. I use Clinic shampoo once a year. I spend Rs 2 on sindoor every month. The gold bangles Ravita wears are for Rs 70, her ring costs Rs 10, her sari Rs 150. The family has a cow, she says, which gives three litres of milk every day. But the cow eats a lot  khaati bahut hai. The family buys 500 kilos or more of bhusa every year for her.Ravitas monthly household budget is Rs 500  thats all that they have left after paying her elder sons Rs-600 school fees. I dont have Ujjawala gas (the Prime Ministers ambitious scheme to provide LPG connections to BPL households) or a toilet at home. Dont ask me why. Our village elders never keep our name in the list (for cooking gas connections). If Mayawatis government comes, we will have more money, she says.As of now, Ravitas ration card gets her 8 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat for free, and her husband manages another 25 kg of chaawal every month. In our colony, there is no voltage, the fan hardly moves, and bulbs are like dots of light. My biceps pain because I have to draw groundwater daily. The water pump does not work properly, and the thakur in our village doesnt allow us to enter his farm to get water.(Express photo) (Express photo)There are hundreds of women like her at the rally venue, Ravita says. Except old women, all of them work on the thakurs farm, but get no money. The thakur only gives them 6 kilos of wheat every day. Those who work on potato farms are allowed to take a few kilos home. But these are green potatoes, and not of good quality. Landowners never pay us cash.Suddenly, Ravita is distracted. A chopper has appeared in the sky. The crowd rises as one. Ravita is with them, clapping.Mayawati climbs on to the stage. Ravitas eyes are moist, her face is glowing with joy. Kaisi hai? Achchi hai na? she asks.Mayawati ignores the BSP leaders on the stage and starts reading her long speech. Two parties are holding roadshows in Varanasi to occupy the second and third places in this election, she says. Narendra Modi can pray at as many temples as he likes, but he is not going to get results. This is because, she says, the BJP will never be united while I have united the Dalits, and Muslims have added to their heft.Have you got even one rupee in your accounts? Did you get a job after Modi became PM? Has even a rupee of farmers debt been removed so far? Its time to send Narendra Modi back to Gujarat, she says to huge applause.Modi ne chamchon (cronies) ko khadaa kar phoolon ki varsha karaai. He is not going to get the blessings of even his cronies. They dont show it, but they are very unhappy with him. Modis party is daagi-baagion ki party. Many men in the crowd laugh heartily.Mayawati then goes back many years, and starts to read out the history of V P Singhs government, and how the BJP, pursuing its anti-Mandal politics, had forced him to resign. Ravita and Jeevati have begun to doze, and some women start to leave. Other women in blue saris, lathis in hand, tell them to remain seated. They follow the order.On the stage, Mayawati says she has come to know from reliable sources that if the BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation. Akhilesh Yadav is no better, she says  he is Modis nephew, because Modi considers Mulayam Singh Yadav his elder brother. The chief minister is Sa-pa (Samajwadi Party) ka babua, who doesnt know what he is talking. Now, SP ke babua ko bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi nahin bachaa sakti.As Mayawatis chopper leaves, the crowd starts to move out as it had come in  in a slow, orderly fashion. Ravita comes running to this correspondent. Are you going to get me Ujjawala gas? she asks.And then, coming closer, says, Mere pati ko naukri dilwaye, mujhe gas nahin chahiye.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

An early spring sun filters through the trees onto the ruins of Somit Pratap Singhs hereditary home. He is supervising the building of his new home, as the mountain of bricks before which he sits suggests. Somit has just completed his MSc from the Shri Vishwanath Degree College nearby and hopes to become a primary school teacher, once the Assembly elections conclude and recruitment is resumed.Three days before polling in the Kadipur Assembly constituency (February 27), in which this village falls, we talk about the electoral prospects of the parties in the fray. Its BJP versus BSP here, he says confidently. His vote, like that of his fellow Thakurs, will go to the kamal ka phool (lotus, the BJP symbol). He suddenly rushes off and returns with a large notebook, flips it open and shows me a family tree he has drawn up painstakingly. It goes back two centuries. Its important that future generations know who their ancestors were, he stresses.The Thakurs, BJP loyalistsIndeed, pride in their heritage is a recurring theme with the Thakurs who dominate the village politically, own the largest tracts of land, and are patrons of education. Kalan has many shortcomings, but it has an array of educational options in its immediate vicinity from the government school and degree college to the swish Shivbrat Childrens Academy and an engineering college: it ensures that virtually every child here is getting an education. The last named is administered by Uma Shankar Singh, the former pradhan of Kalan, who studied at Mumbais K.C. College and the Mafatlal Institute before embarking on a 25-year-long career in textile quality control that included a stint at Subbu Textiles in Tamil Nadus Erode district.Rajendra Bahadur Singh, a primary school teacher in a neighbouring village, claims his familys arrival in these parts predates Rana Pratap  a Thakur icon  who ruled in the sixteenth century. His ancestors, he says, came as horse traders from Amer in Rajasthan, overthrew the Rajbhars who were the local rulers at the time and settled down in the village of Khanpur Pilai, less than five km from Kalan. Today, he proclaims proudly, Our clan of Kachwaha Thakurs is spread over 52 villages and the Rajbhars work on our land. But we dont have any social relations with them.Its a given that Rajendra and his family, including his elder brother who holds a PhD in sociology from Lucknow University and has done research work at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University, will vote BJP. It is the only nationalist party  all educated people will vote for Narendra Modi, he says.And then he adds, This time, the Rajbhars, who are traditional BSP supporters and even voted for the party in 2014, have shifted to the BJP. The reason? A brand-new Rajbhar party, the Bharatiya Samaj Party, that takes its inspiration from Raja Suhel Dev, ironically enough the Rajbhar king who was defeated by the Thakurs, has allied itself with the BJP this time.Rajbhars shifting right?In Kalan, the Rajbhars, an OBC community, are numerically larger than the Thakurs but, barring the Musahars (earlier rat catchers but now landless labourers), are the poorest in the village. Its members largely live below the poverty line. A handful are marginal cultivators not even growing enough to feed their families, while the vast majority are landless labourers here.The Rajbhar quarter in the village is a tongue of land surrounded on three sides by lush green fields of paddy and mustard. But most of it belongs to another OBC community, the Badhais, traditionally makers of agricultural tools, but whose secondary occupation is cultivation.The crowded mud hovels in which the Rajbhars live are a far cry from the well-lit havelis and whitewashed bungalows of the Thakurs, equipped with modern conveniences. Some have laid out their string beds outside their homes. To protect themselves from the elements and the mosquitoes, they have opened out used fertiliser bags and stitched them into mosquito net-like canopies for their beds.Our ancestors left us no land, says Sanichara sadly, so we work on the lands of the Thakurs and the Badhais. Rajpati and Mala join in the conversation to complain they have the  lal rang ka card  (BPL card) but dont get any of the welfare benefits that others seem to enjoy. No one cares whether we are alive or dead, says Mala. We have no proper drains or toilets, and a kucha (unpaved) road leads to our dwellings. Her nephew, Munna, is a mason who has seen a bit of life outside the village. Look at Bihar: have you seen the pitch (tarred) roads there? he says enviously. Here we were told that everyone with a red BPL card would get a free bulb, and pay Rs. 25 on electricity. But we are being made to pay Rs. 270. In the hand-to-mouth existence that they live, that makes a big hole in their meagre earnings.So has anyone come to seek your votes, I ask. Yes, says Rajpati, someone from the BSP. But when I ask who they are voting for, the women say,  Kono palan nahin (We havent decided yet). Mala adds,  Jahan public jutegi wahan jayenge (Wherever the majority is going, we will follow).Sanicharas father-in-law, Motinath, with matted long hair and a straggly unkempt beard, is more forthcoming: The cycle [the SP symbol] is looking at its community, the elephant [the BSP symbol] at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal .As I turn to leave, there is a surprise. Sanichara, Rajpati and Mala follow me. As soon as they are out of earshot distance from their menfolk, they grab my arm and whisper in my ear: We like Mayawati: we have attended her rallies in the past. We are going to vote for her. Dont you think thats a good idea?Camp BSP: the DalitsIf the Thakurs of Kalan have memories of military triumphs stretching over several centuries that gives them the self-confidence to take on the challenges of life, the BSP phenomenon has empowered the Dalits over the last 25 years. Indeed, though Akbarpur, the birthplace of the socialist leader, Ram Manohar Lohia, is less than 40 km away, only old-timers in the village have fleeting memories of him, with a statue and a few educational institutions named after him there. Instead, with BSP founder Kanshi Ram making this region  of which Kalan is a part  one of his social laboratories, it is the BSP that continues to have influence here.In Kalan, numerically too there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. As I walk to the Dalit quarter, right at the heart of the village, this is immediately visible, especially among the women and the younger generation.Uneducated Dalits like Ramachal and his wife Usha are marginal farmers, who supplement their income by carrying bricks at building sites. But they have nothing left at the end of the month. Ramachals ailing father gets a pension, but thats about it. They complain about notebandi (the demonetisation exercise) and are a bit subdued, but their eldest child, Sonu, who is in Class XI at the local government school, is not. He says he wants to be an engine driver and see the world. His mother butts in to say sourly, Where will we get the money for the bribe? But Sonu remains cool and instead explains the Pythagorean theorem with aplomb  a tribute both to him and the school where he studies.At 17, he doesnt have a vote but clearly takes an interest in politics, for it is he who says that his parents will vote for the elephant.  Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants, Sonu stresses.Like Sonu, one of their neighbours, Sunita Devi, who works at an Anganwadi, has her own world view. An attractive young married woman, she is the mother of three little girls, and has studied till Class X. Modi had said ghar ghar sauchalaya [a toilet in every house], but we have no toilets yet, she says. We will vote for Behenji because she gives the most benefits. When my eldest child was born, she was in power and the government gave Rs. 1 lakh insurance for the baby. When my daughter turns 18, I can use the accrued money for her marriage.I tell Sunita I had heard that a BJP representative visited the Dalit quarter, and ask her what she thinks of the Prime Minister. Yes, Rajesh Kumar [a BJP activist] came here and said, vote for kamal ka phool. I told him we are haathi [elephant] people, so forget about it. And then she takes off on the Central government: I was expecting my third child last November and had gone to my parents home in Azamgarh district. Thanks to notebandi , my parents had such a tough time raising the Rs. 5,000 for me to have the child at a private hospital.So what does she expect of the Prime Minister? When we choose a Prime Minister, we do it in the hope that he creates a harmonious atmosphere, and works for the welfare of all the people. Then everyone will be happy. We dont expect notebandi  everyone sitting at home and crying, she says.If the Dalit women are committed Mayawati supporters, some of the men are considering other options. Ramprakash, a bus conductor who earns Rs. 4,000 a month, says, We are haathiwalen but its not necessary that we will all vote BSP. Modi has done some good work: lets try him once. His fiery young wife, Shashikala, and their neighbour, Meera, turn on him: Rubbish! He has done nothing. We women at any rate will vote BSP.And then comes another surprise. Meera says, Our grown-up sons are considering another option  Akhilesh Yadav [of the SP], because he has given cycles and laptops.The split backward voteBut Mayawati has other admirers among the backward castes. In Kalan, there are half-a-dozen homes of the Lohars, traditional blacksmiths, but who have now turned to carpentry, with many moving to Mumbai. The Lohars have some land, but it is not enough to feed them. Saroja Surajlal Vishwakarma, the young daughter-in-law of one Lohar household, is an ardent Modi admirer. But her aunt-in-law, Parvati, who lives in Mumbai and is here on vacation, hates the Prime Minister. She had to pawn her jewellery to get her husband treated after demonetisation devastated their carpentry business. Someone who begs for your votes should not oppress you. Life was best for women under Mayawati. I have been to her rallies, she says firmly.But not all communities who vote BSP have been empowered. Take Kalans only Musahar family. Ram Chander, his two brothers, and his wife Lakshmina, who suffers from a nervous disorder, live on the edge of the village. Three decades back, they lived in a small room in the nearby kasba , and would travel to Kalan for work. One day, a Thakur said that he would give them a piece of land in exchange for which they would have to make sal leaf pattals (plates) and clear away the soiled plates. Now no one eats from those plates and they do odd jobs to eke out an existence. They also have a little stall on the main road where they sell chewable tobacco, potato crisps and toffees.If the Lohars are divided, another backward caste, the Chaurasias, traditional betel growers and a community that has social relations with the Thakurs, are firmly with the BJP. Kalans current pradhan Bimla Devi was away in Mumbai to attend to her husband Chottey Lal, who is admitted in a hospital there after he sustained a heart attack. They have a thriving betel leaf and motor parts business in that city. That is evident from the imposing three-storey house they are building in the village, with tiered, carved balconies that curve around the structure.Their younger son, Krishna, who has a BSc degree, is standing in for his mother. He reels off all the improvements he has made to the village  drains, roads, electricity  and says he hopes to contest the seat when it is de-reserved. His elder brother Mukesh, who is going to sit for the entrance exams for a government job, and he are both BJP supporters. Mukesh says he likes the BJP but wishes the party would not try and divide society  also he makes it clear that reservation for OBCs must continue. But Krishna likes the party for its anti-Muslim stance: They tease our girls in Muslim-dominated areas and the SP gives them protection, he says, adding, I want Yogi Adityanath to be Chief Minister.In Kalan, however, the Muslims are a miniscule minority, no more than six families, two of whom live on one edge of the village. But the two  related to each other  have quarrelled over land, and a wall separates their homes. Tabassum is a young widow. She and her daughter live with her mother and sister-in-law. They have no land, so her brother who works in Mumbai sends home money to support them. My daughter, Saina Bano, has friends at the private school she attends, but none in the village. For much of the year, they live in splendid isolation: Most people dont know we are Muslims, so we go and play Holi, she says and then adds, We invite people for Bakrid. Yes, she will vote, she says. I hear people are voting for Mayawati. Ill do the same.Akhileshs Yadavs?The Yadavs in Kalan are predictably supporters of the SP: they are largely educated and financially on a stable footing. Sangeeta, a young housewife who also works at an Anganwadi, lives in a joint family. Her brother-in-law Rajesh has an MA degree and is looking for a job. But the family has enough land to not only to feed itself but also sell in the open market. Everyone here says they are voting SP, but it is the younger members who answer the difficult questions. The cherubic-looking Saurabh is only 16, but clearly sharper than his elders: when I ask the family what they have to say about the Yadavs cornering all the benefits, it is he who responds, measuring his words carefully: Do only OBCs walk on the roads or benefit from the ambulances and police vans? Are they the only ones who get pensions? Yes, there may be many Yadavs in the police and forces because we are a martial people. But the bureaucracy is dominated by Kayasthas and Brahmins. Why not talk about that?And then Saurabh springs a surprise. He will be of voting age by 2019 and he says: I am very impressed by Modis personality. I think many in my family will vote BJP in 2019. His uncles demur but he has let the cat out of the bag. After SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav came to power, through the 1990s and the 2000s, political power helped the Yadavs prosper materially and enter the middle class. Their aspirations have changed and many no longer wish to be associated with a party associated with lathi-wielding musclemen. If the advent of the polished Akhilesh Yadav has held them back, the results of the current elections could well determine the future voting patterns of the community.The cycle is looking at its community, the elephant at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal (lotus).Motinath Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants.sonuOur grown-up sons are considering Akhilesh Yadav because he has given cycles and laptops.Meera"
74,Shooting’s Great Divide,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/shootings-great-divide-4554714/,2017-03-04,Indian Express,"Trap shooter Birendeep Sodhi poses next to his Porsche 911 Carrera. Trap shooter Birendeep Sodhi poses next to his Porsche 911 Carrera.Encompassed within shooting are competitors from diverse cultural and economic strata on one hand, there is a shooter as affluent as Birendeep Sodhi, while on the other, there is someone like Jitu Rai, who strode over several hurdles to pursue the sport. Indian Express explores these multi-layered divisions at workLook at this. I could buy this because I didnt shoot for four years. Shooting is an expensive sport. Birendeep Sodhi caresses his Porsche. A blazing red Carrera 911. He leans against it, a shotgun slung on his right shoulder, and poses with his prized possession. Like a hunter whos chased down his prey, albeit in a fancy sports car.Back in the day, Sodhi was a promising young trap shooter; a 2003 junior Asian champion. But his senior career never really took off. Unlike his elder brother Ronjan, who went on to become a world record holder and a World No. 1 in double trap.Sodhi was always there or thereabouts  competing at World Cups occasionally but unable to do anything noteworthy. So in 2012, soon after getting married, he quit international shooting and chose to concentrate on family business. Rather, businesses.What else is making newsSodhi belongs to the Royal family of Sodhi Nagar, a village in the border district of Firozpur in Punjab where his grandfather relocated to after partition. On one of the farmlands, he indulged in organic farming. And along with that, he took up another ambitious project. A holiday resort in Bali, he says. Thats my dream project. The work on that is already underway. Sodhi has set himself a deadline of 2018 to finish that project. The 2018 Asian Games are also in Indonesia. I want to be there. If I can achieve both my targets, itll be great.With that as one of his fuelling motivations, he was back at the range regularly. And at 34, he is on a comeback trail.As Sodhi talks about his journey, 14-year-old Shapath Bhardwaj takes his position at the shotgun range. A prodigious double trap talent, Shapaths career was set in motion by Ronjan. He is among the elite today but the ride to Karni Singh hasnt been a comfortable one for Shapath. His parents working in Meerut, he had to hitch a ride with a fellow shotgun shooter to the range. Shapaths family does not boast of family wealth like many other shooters to back the expensive dreams. Both his parents are journalists who work for national dailies and live in a modest house in Meerut.Shapath Bharadwajs parents own a modest set of wheels. Shapath Bharadwajs parents own a modest set of wheels.For the last one year, he has been travelling to the Karni Singh range thrice a week. On most occasions, the 100km one-way journey was made in a Tata Nano, driven by his mother. The cramped backseat of the countrys cheapest car became Shapaths makeshift study and dining room, eating his meals and finishing his portion for the Class IX exam while travelling to, and from, the range.Last year, while returning to Meerut after selection trials, Shapaths car was hit by a truck as they tried to avoid a biker. The car was completely crushed from the back, his father S Raju says. But his son and wife were unharmed. That day, we thought whether its worth all this? But we had no other option. We couldnt afford to rent an accommodation or move to Delhi. The only thing we could do is to be a bit more careful as we chase a dream, thats all, Raju says.After using a borrowed gun initially, Raju purchased a brand-new shotgun worth (approximately) Rs 7 lakh  their first major investment. Seventy percent of the money for the shotgun was taken as a loan from family members. I am still repaying some of them, Raju, 50, says. Its an expensive sport, you know?***Shooting, they often say, is a rich mans hobby. A stroll around the shotgun range at the Karni Singh Shooting Range during the World Cup gives you an idea why they say so. If not for the frequent boom in the background of the shots being fired, this could well pass off as a plush auto exhibition as the Indian shooters zoom in and out of the range in their fancy automobiles.On the lawns alongside the six shotgun ranges are luxurious tents for the shooters to rest in between their rounds. Some have butlers serving ala carte menu. The last two days, the talking point at the range was Saeed Al Maktoum, of UAEs royal family, jet-setting to Delhi in his own airplane with an entourage as big as his countrys contingent at the World Cup.Its the sport of the royalty. And theyd like it that way. For a new shooter from a modest background, the atmosphere can get intimidating. They want to create this image of shotgun being a sport for the elite, says Mansher Singh, a former Asian and Commonwealth champion.Across the street, the disparity becomes even more glaring. As the shotgun shooters rest in their tents, some of their rifle and pistol counterparts sit on the sidewalk, eating frozen sandwiches while awaiting a call-up for their events. The rifle and pistol disciplines are shotguns poor cousins. They attract maximum participation at a World Cup, primarily because they are more affordable. There is class divide within the rifle and pistol shooters, too. But it isnt as in-your-face as, say, at a shotgun range.The two worlds try to coexist. But when one shooter flaunts a weapon which has his name engraved in 24-carat gold, the other has been surviving on a borrowed rifle for a long part of his career, the gulf, at times, is too wide to bridge. And ever so conspicuous.***Range par sirf score bolta hai.Samresh Jung is perhaps the most chilled out shooter you will meet on the range. You usually see him blend into groups with varying dynamics. But he is one of the rare ones. When we are there on the range, it doesnt matter what background you are from. You are mingling with everyone and its fine, Jung says. What matters is when you get back to your rooms. How you stay, eatA majority of the shooters keep to themselves and stay separately. The rifle/pistol and shotgun shooters barely talk on the range. Most of the times their events are held separately but on the few occasions when they are together, both rarely cross each others paths. Its a predominant thing at a shotgun range. Youre sitting there, getting six-seven people of the same level. They will get segregated. There is no oneness on the range, Mansher says.Joydeep Karmakar, who finished fourth at the London Olympics in 50m rifle prone, says the surprise factor for a first-timer is huge. We stumble upon stuff, which the rest are already acquainted to. On my first tour, I didnt know what kind of food they want to order or the kind of clothes to wear, Karmakar says.We dont come from a strong robust family. We dont have a history of parents staying at 7-star hotels. When you are aboard, contrast is much more visible between the armed forces guys, who come from rural backgrounds, and the rest.A pistol shooter, who is currently with the team, says he would lock himself in the room during his first few tours abroad to avoid embarrassing himself. The lifestyle polarities were such that comfort became a very relative term. During a national championships a few years ago, we were once staying at an accommodation which was fancy for me, the Army man from a remote village says. But a couple of teammates left the place immediately and checked into a fancier hotel. Its not that they are wrong and I am right, just that our definitions of normal differ.The high scores he shot earned him the respect of his peers and they warmed up on the range. Off it, though, very few hang out together. The backgrounds matter, eventually. We mustnt forget shooters were in the strata of Zamindars and Rajas. It started as a hobby and became a little bit serious after the World Cups and Olympics. That is a fact about the sport, Karmakar says.***Ani Koshy, the mother of rifle shooter Elizabeth, says her daughter had it in her genes. The Koshys, originally hailing from Pathanapuram in Kerala, have a rich hunting tradition. Elizabeths grandfather, Abraham, father Prasad and brothers all indulged in the pastime to stay in touch with the traditions and skills of their ancestors, Ani says.The family used to own shares in a rubber estate before selling them and relocating in Liberia. The mother and daughter stayed back, and now Elizabeth is continuing the familys shooting tradition.The journey, however, hasnt been so straightforward for some others. Pooja Ghatkar, who won a bronze medal at the World Cup last week, was raised by a single parent after she lost her father at the age of seven. Its a mother-daughter story of a different kind. Their life would change when Poojas mother Bharti, a maths teacher, Googled shooting. After scavenging through hundreds of pages online to understand the sport, she got Pooja enrolled at the Balewadi Sports Complex range. They then sold their house in Talegaon so that they could afford a rifle and other expenses to pursue the sport, and now live in a rented accommodation near the shooting range in Pune.Abhinav Bindra may have won the gold medal courtesy crores his father, a meat exporter, invested in building a shooting range at his farmhouse in Chandigarh. Jitu Rai, Indias biggest medal hope at present, lived in a modest house on a tiny farm in Nepal.Jitu Rais family at his village in Nepal, where he was brought up. Jitu Rais family at his village in Nepal, where he was brought up.Rai spent most of his childhood growing potatoes and corn. His tiny village, he says, is so remote that it often takes an entire day just to finish the strenuous climb up the hill. The 29-year-old joined the Indian Army, where he would first pick up a pistol.Indian shooting is littered with such flagrantly contrasting stories. You are either rich enough to fund your own ambitions or take the Services route, since the weapons, ammos and infrastructure are easily available. Only a handful few civilians from a middle-class background have made it big.***A shooters decision to choose a particular discipline is influenced largely by affordability. Rifle, pistol and shotgun are the three main disciplines and each of them has varying demands, financially speaking. Shotgun is the most expensive whereas the cheapest events are air rifle and air pistol. So youll notice that, generally, middle and lower middle class athletes will opt for these events, Karmakar says.An air pistol costs approximately Rs 1.5 lakh while the cost of one pellet is Re 1. For an event like the rapid fire, the pistol cost is more or less the same. But the bullet costs around Rs 25. A shooter ends up firing 300 to 500 rounds a day, making it a costly affair.A superior-quality air rifle comes for Rs 2.5 lakh and the cost of the pellet is the same as pistol  Re 1. A small bore rifle is slightly more expensive. It can cost up to Rs 5 lakh and the ammunition costs up to Rs 30 each. A shooter generally fires 100-150 rounds a day, so one days practice can cost up to Rs 4,500. And thats just the ammo cost.The costliest, however, is shotgun. A high-quality shotgun costs approximately Rs 7-8 lakh. The cost of a cartridge is around Rs 25 and the clay target is approximately Rs 20. A shotgun shooter fires 250 shots on an average per day, taking the cost to up to Rs 10,000 for a single session. None of these include coaching or range fees. Its like firecrackers. Paisa dhuan ban jaata hai. You cant use the same bullet twice, Sodhi says. People think because we can afford it, its easy for us. In truth, though, we do it because we are passionate about it.***Mansher is determined to burst this exclusivity bubble.The former Asian and Commonwealth Games medallist talks from experience. Joey, as he is fondly known on the circuit, was a cub shooter but was already challenging the well-established names in the team for a place in the trap team for the 1982 Asian Games.Randir Singh, a former trap shooter, and an ex-secretary general of the Indian Olympic Association. Randir Singh, a former trap shooter, and an ex-secretary general of the Indian Olympic Association.Back then, Karni Singh, Randhir Singh and Gurbir Singh were still active shooters. Even though Mansher had better scores, he wasnt included in the team. My place was given to shooters from the royal families. Thats how the sport was, Mansher says, without taking any names.For the last 10 years, Mansher has been running a talent identification programme in Bhopal for trap shooting. He was mocked initially for trying to bring a sport that was meant for the elite to the masses. Today, the academy has 100 trainees and some have even made it to the national team.One of them, Manisha Kheer, made her World Cup debut last week. Her father is a fisherman at the Bhopal Lake. In the first few nationals, my trainees got overawed by the grandeur, like the lifestyle of the shooters and the kind of equipment they used. It affected them in a negative way, psychologically, Mansher says. But after competing, they realised they are on par with them. There is another shooter I have whose father is an electrician. We are trying to show that you really dont have to be rich to try shotgun shooting, or any shooting for that matter.Most shooters say the difference is less apparent now than what it was a decade ago. The collective rise in the standards means its just the scores that matter. Eventually, youll be known for your scores, Jung says. It doesnt matter then if you drive to a range in a Porsche or a Nano.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"
75,Pepsico India to focus on health products,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pepsico-india-to-focus-on-health-products/article17404907.ece,2017-03-04,The Hindu,"Clean water:Pepsi says it has helped improve access to drinking water for about four million people.APImproving farmers income, stepping up production of health products and protecting the operating ecosystem will remain key constituents of Pepsis business strategy in India, according to a top official of the company.In a free-wheeling interaction with The Hindu here on Friday, D. Shivakumar, CEO, PepsiCo India Holdings Private Ltd., said, we have nothing to do with PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a non-government organisation].Asserting that Pepsi had been a partner of Indian farmers all along, he said sustainability had been a crucial component of its partnership with Indian farmers. Pointing to the technology support and extension programmes that Pepsi had been providing to potato growers in the country, he said the focus of the exercise was to touch the entire value chain  from input provision to facilitating financial support and product procurement. The resultant ecosystem, he said, helped farmers improve yield, get higher price and earn predictable income.Mr. Shivakumar said Pepsi would try to extend similar support to those cultivating crops such as mango. Our effort is very much aligned to the countrys big need of doubling farmers income by 2022. We continue to invest into areas which are very important to farmers, he said.Pepsi, he said, was working with close to 24,000 potato growers. We have brought in Frito Lay variety of seeds into India. Farmers have a buy-back agreement with us, and their income have gone up by 35% over the last 2-3 years, he added.Mr. Shivakumar asserted that we are water positive. In this context, he said, Pepsi had given back 12.75 billion litres of water in 2015 alone through assorted conservation and replenishment initiatives. In Tamil Nadu, especially, Pepsi was water positive by 1.5 billion litres in 2015, he added.The three manufacturing facilities it had in Tamil Nadu provided direct jobs to 3,500 people. A release claimed that PepsiCo Foundation invested $17.6 million (close to Rs. 114 crore) between 2008-2016 for programmes related to WASH (Swacch Bharat) and improved access to clean drinking water, benefiting more than four million people across the country.Tamil Nadu is one of the key markets from the point of our investments, brand stature and community initiatives, he said. His statement must be viewed in the context of a recent call for ban on sales of Pepsi and Coca Cola drinks in the state by local traders associations.Reinforcing the 3 P thrust (on people, product and planet), Mr. Shivakumar said Pepsi would fully fit into the Prime Ministers Make in India campaign even as it sought to transform its product portfolio to contain more health products. We have a vision of this. And, we have a plan as well, he said.Innovation and local tastes would be the focal point of this transformation, he said. All these would make Pepsi more than a carbonated soft drink. In this context, he asserted that the introduction of Quaker products would transform the way breakfast was taken by the Indian people."
76,'Potato factory' keeps farmers in business,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170305/jsp/bengal/story_139079.jsp,2017-03-05,Telegraph,"Farmers cultivate process grade potato for PepsiCo in Anandapur village in Hooghly Anandapur (Arambagh), Mar. 4: Had Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi fought the farm-versus-factory debate over aloo (potato) in Anandapur village of Bengal, chances are that the Congress vice-president would have won by more than a wafer-thin margin. For the hundred-odd farmers working for US multinational PepsiCo, growing the right variety of potato is probably the most crucial step in a long process that culminates in factories churning out munchies. During an election rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh earlier this week, Prime Minister Modi had taken a dig at Rahul, who had in the past echoed farmers' demand to set up a potato factory for them. ""You are demanding a factory of aloo... but I am an Opposition leader. I can't take decisions. I can't put up an aloo factory,"" Rahul had said during his kisan yatra last year. Without naming Rahul, Modi said at a rally this week that potato grows in fields, not in a factory. ""You tell me whether aloo grows in the factory or field. You know but he does not know,"" the Prime Minister had said. But Rahul probably meant potato processing, which Pepsi is doing in Bengal. Bengal produces 112 lakh tonne of table grade potato compared with under 1 lakh tonne of process grade Growing the special process grade potato has saved at least 10,000 farmers this year from a price crash that the regular jyoti variety suffered because of a bumper crop. Compared to Rs 400 a sack (50kg each) for process potato that Pepsi is offering farmers at Anandapur in Hooghly, jyoti is selling at Rs 150 a sack from the field. That is because Pepsi had agreed on the price before the sowing season started in October. Last year, the jyoti variety had fetched a better price than the process variety. But Asim Choudhury, a farmer in Anandapur, stuck to the corporate because of his experience the year before. In 2015, he had decided to give Pepsi a break and gone back to growing the traditional variety. He lost Rs 18,000 a bigha. ""That taught me a lesson. I did not switch this year to jyoti even though there was a higher return in 2016. I have been proven right,"" Choudhury, who owns an acre, said. PepsiCo's chip factories need a potato with low sugar and high percentage of dry matter. The farmer is hoping to make a profit around Rs 18,000 a bigha on the crop he is harvesting now using a power tiller fitted with an attachment specially designed for potatoes. He has rented the machine, as he did in October last year to prepare the field and sow the seeds. The mechanical intervention, which almost turned the farm to factory, saved him at least Rs 2,500 a bigha. Chandicharan Mandal, a local handler or aggregator who has an agreement with Pepsi for cultivation of the process grade potato, had arranged the power tiller on rent with the company's help. According to Jaideep Bhatia, agri-director of Pepsi India, there are 117 such aggregators in Bengal who in turn work with farmers. Machines such as these can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. ""The state laws do not allow direct agreement with farmers like we do in Maharashtra. Even though a direct tie-up would have been more transparent, we are not complaining. We are working with the aggregators,"" Bhatia said. Mandal said he was looking after 150 acres in the area, about 90km from Calcutta. He gets the seeds from Pepsi, arranges pesticides and fertilisers, and then gets power tillers on rent as most small farmers cannot afford to buy them. ""Working for Pepsi has proved remunerative if somebody sticks to the company for 3-4 years. Now with the big power tillers, we are trying to move towards more mechanisation. It is almost like a factory,"" Mandal said, holding a pack of potato chips sold under the Lays brand by PepsiCo in India. His only grouse? ""We want more machines. Only a fraction of land can be harvested with this one. Please tell the company to get it next year. Everyone is asking for it,"" Mandal said, pointing to the tractor which can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. The correspondent's trip to Anandapur was sponsored by PepsiCo"

In addition to that, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandak Committee (SGPC) has decided to directly purchase potatoes from the farmers.Khuswant Singh, (45), of Moosapur village in Jalandhar, committed suicide after he suffered a loss in his potato crop, and was in debt of Rs 20 lakh, including cultivating his crop on leased land. The Punjab government has also instructed the education department that schools should directly buy potatoes from farmers at Rs 5 per kg for the mid-day meal scheme in government schools across the state to boost their sales.The meeting in this regard was held between BKU representatives and Kahan Singh Pannu, Managing Director of PAIC, in which all the details were given to farmer leaders. Corporation officials are in talks with Russia, Iran and Sri Lanka to finalise the deal soon, in a bid to resolve the crisis. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu has agreed to the Punjab Governments request to keep five lakh bags of potatoes in its cold storage.Many farmers, who waited for the prices to stabilise, left their crops standing in the field. However, the new crop came in February, adding to the standing stock and a lot of unsold potatoes already kept in cold storage.The State government has sent the case to the Election Commission of India to sanction Rs 5 crore so that it could buy the first lot of potatoes after the mode of conduct is in place.All the Deputy Commissioners in the State have been directed to buy the crop directly from farmers at Rs 500 and send it to prison departments and schools for the mid-day meal scheme.Meanwhile, Chief Secretary of SGPC Harcharan Singh said, we would be buying the potatoes directly from the farmers as we have told the managers of the gurdwaras and other institutions under the SGPC control to do the same. Presently our institutions are buying potatoes from the open market at Rs 8 per kg on an average. I have also discussed this matter with Punjab Agro Industries Corporation officials.Unable to sell their produce, angry farmers in the Doaba region had on Wednesday dumped 500 quintals of potato on the road, causing a traffic jam on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway.The trouble began in November when farmers from Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat cancelled their orders for potato seeds from Punjab because demonetisation had greatly affected them."

Narinder Kumar Langarwala said he had replaced dal with 'aloo ki sabji' at his daily langar. ""It may be a small step, but this is what I can do to help them,"" he said.While hailing the efforts of hoteliers and langarwalas, Jamhuri Kissan Sabha president Satnam Singh said the government should come to the rescue of farmers. ""We have demanded to fix minimum selling price of potatoes at Rs 10 to sail farmers out of the present crisis,"" he said.Gurnam Singh, a potato grower, said that in view of high demand and attractive price of potatoes received last year, the farmers in the region brought maximum of their land under potato cultivation."

She cited that the vegetables in the village were way much cheaper than in Sambalpur city.In the village, potato was being sold at Rs 5 per kg, one and half kg of tomato for Rs 10, drum sticks for Rs 20 and cabbage for Rs 3 per kg. On the other hand, potato is selling for Rs 8 a kilo, tomato Rs 10 per kg and drum sticks Rs 35 per kg in the city.A view of the vegetable market in Sambalpuron Saturday | ExpressWhile traders attribute the difference in prices to transportation and porter cost besides levy imposed by Regulated Market Committees, failure of authorities concerned to rein in the vendors seems to have led the farmers to such a situation.The tall promises made by the BJD Government to provide 35 per cent irrigation in each block besides cold storage across the State remain unfulfilled. Blame it on the indifference of the administration which has left the vegetable growers and farmers at the mercy of vendors, who never fail to exploit them.The prices of vegetables were much lower a week ago and began rising with the rise in mercury level.Green chilli, which is available at Rs 24 per kg in the village, is sold at Rs 40 in town and city markets, tomato is priced at Rs 120 for 25 kg (Rs 4.80 a kg) and sold at Rs 10 per kg, brinjal around Rs 6 against market price of Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg, cucumber is sold by farmers at Rs 15 per kg while it costs Rs 20 in the market. On the other hand, there is a margin of Rs 10 in one kg of coriander leaves which is purchased at Rs 30 and sold at Rs 40, beans are priced at Rs 20 and sold at Rs 30.But, the summer vegetables of pointed gourd (potal) and ladies finger are expensive as of now with pointed gourd being sold by farmers at Rs 70 a kg. The same is sold between Rs 90 and Rs 120, ladies finger is sold in open market at Rs 50 per kg while farmers are selling it at Rs 30 per kg.It is the cabbage growers who have been badly hit with many failing to recover even the harvesting cost. A bag containing 40 kg cabbage is available for Rs 100 even as it is being sold at Rs 6 per kg in the open market, while cauliflower is being purchased from growers at Rs 12 to Rs 14 and sold by vendors at Rs 20.Onion growers too are crying tears of neglect. In Titlagarh, the Nashik of Odisha, distress sale was reported. Although it has been two years since an integrated pack house was developed by APICOL, mere transfer of land to install the transformer to electrically charge the pack house has denied the onion growers to stock their produce and sell it when prices soar."

Jasbir Malhi INLD MLA Parminder Dhull protests against the state government for low potato prices, outside Haryana Vidhan Sabha in Chandigarh Wednesday. Jasbir MalhiINDIAN NATIONAL Lok Dal MLA Parminder Singh Dhull on Wednesday brought 200 kg potatoes for symbolic sale in the Haryana Assembly complex to show the pitiable condition of potato growers in the state because of a very low price of the crop. He sold the potatoes at the rate of Rs 1 per kilo, alleging that the government has failed to protect the interests of farmers.Watch what else is making news:The employees and others standing in the Assembly complex bought the potatoes from Dhull. The farmers have been forced to sell the potatoes at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg in bulk. Many farmers in Ambala and Sirsa were forced to throw their potatoes on the roads in Ambala and Sirsa because they have to pay carriage charges to take them to the markets in neighbouring towns, Dhull told The Indian Express. Dhull, who brought four bags of potatoes in his Innova, installed a temporary sale counter in the Assembly complex. Here, he was joined by leader of the opposition, Abhay Singh Chautala.The Haryana government should learn from the Assam government which buys potatoes at the rate Rs 5 per kg from farmers offering them minimum support price (MSP) for the vegetables. I fail to understand why the BJP state government doesnt introduce MSP concept for vegetables and fruits to help farmers, added Dhull, a two-time MLA from Jullana constituency of Jind district. According to Dhull, the potatoes are grown in Ambala, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Kaithal and Sirsa districts. Chautala said they would support the farmers, who have planned to agitate, demanding implementation of the Swaminathan Commission Report to ensure profitable rates of their crops.Later, the INLD MLAs also staged a brief walkout from the Assembly after expressing dissatisfaction over assurances of Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar over the issue. Dhankar said the state government sends the recommendations to the Commission for Agriculture Cost and Prices (CACP) for fixing the MSP of crops on the basis of expenditure incurred on the crop in the interest of farmers.Thereafter, CACP submits the recommendations to the Government of India, which after a detailed discussion with the representatives of states, announces MSP. When the market price of pulses and oil seeds is lower than the MSP, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) procures the crop on MSP through HAFED. Likewise, if the market price of cotton is lower than the MSP, it is purchased by the Indian Cotton Corporation at MSP, said Dhankar.He further said that as the market price of black gram and barley is more than the MSP, there is no need for intervention by the government. In addition, according to Dhankar, the state government provides subsidy to the farmers through implementation of schemes sponsored by the Centre and states. Subsidies are provided on seeds, equipments, fertilisers and pesticides, he added. Dhankar said Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is being implemented in order to compensate the farmers for losses on their crops due to natural calamities.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Tomato prices touched a high of Rs 42 a kg at vegetable stores in the city on Tuesday. However, it isnt just tomatoes, but other vegetables too whose prices have begun to climb and are expected to become more expensive when summer sets in.In the case of tomato, prices will have to increase as most of the tomatoes sold are coming from Nagpur, said a vegetable store owner who did not wish to be named. It takes around six days for these tomatoes to reach Chennai as they go to Bengaluru first and then come here. The demand for tomatoes is always high and the supply is getting limited, so prices have to go up.He said he was charging Rs 38 for a kg of tomatoes on Monday but since prices increased by Rs 5 at the Koyambedu vegetable market on Tuesday, he had spiked his rate to Rs 42. He explained that the difference in prices at retail and Koyambedu wholesale market is generally around Rs 4 to Rs 5 less a kg for things like tomatoes and can go up to Rs eight to Rs 10 less in the case of vegetables like beans.Vegetable vendors affirmed that most other vegetables have been hovering around the same prices with minor fluctuation. However, they warned that with the beginning of summer, prices too will go up. They attributed this to different reasons, primary one being the water problem in the State.Water shortage will definitely lead to prices being higher this summer, said S Mani, a vegetable vendor at T. Nagar. Prices of vegetables like ladies finger, especially will keep increasing as it is one of the most commonly bought vegetables in summer.He sold the vegetable at Rs 70 per kg on Tuesday. Prices of onion and potato, however, have remained stable. A kilo of onion can be bought for Rs 18-Rs 20 while a kilo of potato is priced Rs 25."

The drop in potato prices has reduced me to a beggar, says Uttam Das, a potato farmer from Bardhaman district, who has cultivated the crop in 11 acres this year.Mr. Das is one of the many potato farmers in the State who has been badly hit by the sharp decrease in potato prices.Compared with last year when potatoes sold at Rs. 550 per 50 kg, the price this year has gone down to Rs. 200 per 50 kg.According to potato merchants, this years bumper crop along with the heavy losses sustained by them last year due to demonetisation are the key reasons for the drop in prices.While last year the total potato yield in Bengal was 95 lakh tonnes, this year it has shot up to 1.50 crore tonnes, said potato merchant Biswanath De.He pointed out that last year both the potato merchants and the cold storage owners sustained heavy losses due to demonetisation as most of the transaction in the business is done in cash.We (potato merchants) are simply out of cash and last years losses have made us apprehensive and forced us into buying potatoes on large scale, said Mr. De.Almost no buyersIn Bengal, the main potato producing districts are Hooghly, Bardhaman, Paschim Medinipur, Bankura and Birbhum. Usually potatoes are harvested from December to February and then put in cold storage. Merchants start to purchase the crop from March 1 when it is taken out of cold storage. But this year the crop is lying in cold storages and we have almost no buyers, said Uttam Das, a potato farmer. Moreover, nearly 20 lakh tonnes of potatoes will probably rot in the fields as the nearly 450 cold storages in the State are unable to store this years harvest.Price to increase soonEven as he admitted that that there was a problem due to the limited number of cold storages, State Agriculture Minister Purnendu Basu avoided a direct reply on whether potato farmers have sustained losses. Pointing to this years high yield, the Minister said the 450 cold storages in Bengal do not have the capacity to accommodate such a large harvest and urged cold storage owners to set up more facilities in the rural agricultural markets set up the State government.In agriculture profits cannot be the same every year, he told The Hindu . On Monday, Mr. Basu claimed in the State Assembly that currently farmers are getting Rs. 4.50 per kg of potato and the price will increase soon."

Yet to recover from the crop loss of 2015-16 kharif season, they were forced to go for distress sale of cabbage, tomato and chilli and now it is the turn of potato.The farmers had put all their hopes on potato and looked forward to make up for the loss. Even as potato is being sold for `8 per kg in the open market, the farmers are finding it difficult to even recover the cost of cultivation with traders offering anything between `2 and `3 per kg. In the absence of cold storage, the farmers have no way out but to dispose of the produce at throw away prices.Moreover, the State Government is yet to fix the minimum support price (MSP) for potato despite tall claims of Potato Mission. To make things worse there is no organised market to ensure fair price to the farmers.Under Potato Mission, besides providing incentivised potato seed, the State Government had also committed to give capital subsidy for new cold storage as per the agricultural policy of 2013. It was also mooting subsidising power tariff for existing and new cold storages till March 31, 2018.Plans were also sketched to maintain buffer stock to deal with short-term scarcity situation and a target has been set to bring 60,000 hectares of land under potato cultivation by 2017-18. But, on the ground the picture is not rosy. This year, the Department of Horticulture had distributed 5350 quintal potato seeds to 29 farmers in Bhatli, Bargarh and Attabira blocks.The seeds were meant to produce 424 quintal of potato. This apart, about 500 quintal of seeds were procured from open market and cultivated by farmers across the district. As the situation stands today, many farmers have resorted to distress sale of potato while many are refusing to harvest it as they want to avoid further losses.Premanand Dang of Jamurda village in Bargarh block had cultivated potato over half an acre of land. But, he has no purchaser and is forced to sell his produce at distress prices.Those who had taken debt for the crop were the first to sell their crop at `3 per kg in absence of any organised market in the district. Similar is the condition of Rajkumar Pradhan of the village, who is not daring to harvest his crop in absence of market. Even if he harvests the crop, the amount he would be getting for the produce would not be enough to recover the harvesting cost.Assistant Horticulture Officer, Sunil Kumar Seth said no communication has been received from the State Government on MSP of potato. There was no cold storage in the district and said if farmers wish they can avail the facility in Sambalpur, he added."

As Patnaites roll up their sleeves to celebrate Holi this Monday, many will refrain from using synthetic colours and take the natural route this time.""While a 100gm pack of herbal colour costs Rs 70, the synthetic ones are available for Rs 40. Though a tad costlier, the organic variants have made a splash in the market and are more in demand,"" Shyam, a salesperson at a Rajendra Nagar departmental store, said on Wednesday.In fact, a leading fashion retail house in the city is offering its customers a 500gm pack of herbal 'gulaal' for Rs 49 if they buy apparels worth Rs 2,499. Small stores, on the contrary, continue to stock up and sell only the synthetic varieties. Binay, who owns a grocery shop on Boring Road, has ""never heard of organic colours before"".According to health experts, toxins used in colours can cause a host of skin and eye infections. General physician Dr Amrendra Prasad Singh told TOI, ""Chemical colours, adulterated with lead oxide, industrial dyes, burnt engine oil and diesel among other harmful solvents, make your skin dry and are likely to cause cancer. Amid all the fun and frolic, do not forget to scrub the harmful colours off your skin immediately otherwise there are chances you will develop rashes later.""Even youngsters vouch for the benefits of using herbal colours instead of the chemical ones. Mainpura resident Anubha, who goes for a wild and whacky Holi celebration every year, has already ordered a 1kg pack of organic 'gulaal' worth Rs 792 from an online shopping portal. She said, ""Organic colours, made from extracts of flowers and leaves, do not have any ill-effects. However, awareness about them is limited. It is high time we shunned readymade perilous 'gulaals' and geared up for a safe and responsible Holi by smearing each other with natural colours.""While many of us are still unaware of the advantages of organic 'gulaals', old-timers claim that Holi colours were originally made of dried flower petals. Boring Road resident Meera Roy, who has memories of Holis gone by, recalled how she and her sister-in-law made natural colours at home. ""Humaare samay mein milaawat nahin hota tha... We used ingredients that were easily available in the kitchen - flour, henna, beetroot, rose petals, sandalwood, potato and turmeric - to prepare homemade 'gulaal' with a natural fragrance. In fact, there are places like Vrindavan where revellers have kept alive the age-old tradition of celebrating the festival of colours with roses and marigolds,"" the sexagenarian said and advised Patnaites to switch to organic colours this Holi."

With the state-owned Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) not producing any hybrid seeds of watermelons, the farmers are solely dependent on private companies, which are selling seeds ranging from Rs 20,000 per kg to Rs 70,000 per kg depending on the variety. Even the seeds of PAUs non-hybrid watermelon variety, Sugar Baby, are not available for sale at its seed shop on the university campus. When The Indian Express visited the PAU seed shop to buy the watermelon seed, the staff deployed at the shop said, Seeds are currently unavailable, although the sowing season has already begun.What else is making news:The state agriculture department has no control over the seed prices of private companies, which enjoy monopoly in hybrid seed sale. Speaking to The Indian Express, Maheshinder Singh, a potato farmer who has started cultivation of watermelon this season after suffering losses in potato crop, said, I have purchased the hybrid watermelon seed for Rs 50,000/kg manufactured by a Bengaluru-based company. The government is not taking any step to check how private companies are looting farmers in selling hybrid seeds. After potato glut, I decided to sow watermelon before paddy to tide over the potato loss to some extent but even melon seeds are so expensive.Watermelon is mostly grown in the Doaba belt of the state with Kapurthala, Nakodar, Shahkot, Jalandhar pockets being dotted with most of the farms. Some pockets are also there in Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and villages near Sutlej banks. With warm weather required for watermelon cultivation coming early in southern parts of the country, the fruit from Karnataka and other southern states also enter the markets of Punjab before farmers here can harvest.Watermelons from Bengaluru and Chennai are already available at shops in Punjab. In fact, they are available round the year now. So, farmers in Punjab are losing interest in watermelons. Seeds are too expensive and then, at mandis, non-hybrid varieties fetch Rs 5 per kg or even less only in peak summers, said Gurpreet Singh, another farmer from Amloh. The hybrid varieties still fetch Rs 50-15/kg for farmers at mandis, Rs 15 being the closing rate at the end of the season. Dilbag Singh, senior scientist, PAU vegetable department, said, PAU is working to develop hybrid variety seeds but it will still take a few years for seeds to reach farmers. Our non-hybrid variety Sugar Baby seeds cost Rs 300-400 per kg only. Since private companies have monopoly on hybrid as of now, their prices are skyrocketing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
91,What women really want,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170309/jsp/opinion/story_139644.jsp,2017-03-09,Telegraph,"Every year without fail when International Women's Day rolls around, it serves as a brutal reminder of how far women have come since medieval times and also how far there is still left to go. This year in the run up to the IWD, Gurmehar Kaur was abused and trolled for merely having an opinion; the Central Board of Film Certification banned Lipstick Under My Burkha, a film exploring female sexuality; 19 aborted female foetuses were found in Sangli in Maharashtra and many men didn't care enough about women's consent or legal consequences and proceeded to rape them. International Women's Day, in the Indian context, has been reduced to tweets, Facebook posts, corporate meetings on sexual harassment (where only women show up), WhatsApp messages and so on, that thank women in their roles as good daughters, mothers, wives, sisters. These messages then oddly suggest that women should be empowered and that they are like goddesses and so should be respected. I am writing this piece to draw attention to this doublespeak in Indian society that has significantly marred women's parity in all spheres - that we celebrate IWD and use it to only praise and laud women in certain roles where they are wholly and unquestionably subservient to others. As a society, it has been recently demonstrated that we will bully women into silence, pay no attention to her consent, and that we are most comfortable when a woman is in the kitchen surrounded by an endlessly recurring pile of potato peels. Part of the tension between female empowerment and how Indian's understand it is related to women's work and Indian society's reliance on unpaid female labour. Consider the fact that in Iceland, for instance, in 1975, 90 per cent of women in the country refused to show up for work and refused to undertake any household work because they were not being paid the same as men for the same job (roughly 60 per cent less than men). Last year, women in Iceland repeated their protest and left work at 2:38 pm because of unequal pay. Such protests over the years were crucial to women emerging in Iceland as a political interest group that paved the way for the election of the first female president in the world. What would happen in India if women refused to work for a day? Food would not be cooked, children would not be bathed and sent to school, husbands would not have their tiffin boxes for the office, clothes would not be washed, in villages and slums the household would have no water, construction work in many places would halt, food stalls would close, farm work would be hit, diapers wouldn't be changed, bathrooms wouldn't be cleaned, loads would not be carried, prayers would not be offered, in-laws wouldn't be fussed over and cared for and there would be a visible disruption of a huge portion of the unorganized sector. Essentially, all that is needed for Indian society to stop functioning at the basic unit of the family is for women to stop working for a week. I would like to think that the above is an exaggeration and that typical Indian men are in fact competent enough to take care of their needs; that they don't need someone in a subservient position as a sock-washer or sex-provider. However, men that help out at home are very rare in India, but more important, many men feel as if they are entitled to their wife's labour and if she is earning, then to her salary and wages. The most important thing that needs to be done for female empowerment to become a reality is that male entitlement over the female body and female labour must be broken. It is because of this that I find it important to be critical of the social media messages that liken empowerment to some state of female godliness that is rooted in antiquity. Making women believe they are goddesses is like asking them to consume LSD where they feel empowered in a mystical realm, but their reality is that they are still stuck at that kitchen sink. We have crafted an excellent script for Indian women, where in childhood the father-patriarch rules them and as adults the husband and son as patriarchs rule them. This also explains why we have an independently sponsored bill which seeks to limit expenditure on marriages, but does not suggest instead that it should be binding that at least the equal of what is spent on a girl's marriage should have been also spent on her education. We wait for a girl to change from child to wife, in spite of her educational accomplishments and career, and once she is married, we also expect her to prioritize children and family over her career. It is no surprise then that the housewife suicide rate in India is rather high if one looks at the NCRB statistics, and that almost no woman in India has a fight-free marriage where at some point or the other she is not depressed or in conflict with her husband, in-laws, her own parents and brothers over property. There is no point in celebrating International Women's Day if in India this day is only a mechanism for men to show that they are appreciative of female labour by likening women to something holy, when the women in fact would like to see some wages for their effort. The day isn't about how nice men are to send such messages on social media. This day is about rededicating oneself to a fight for parity in income, in social roles, inside the house, in nutrition, in healthcare access, in educational access. Women don't want a sharper potato peeler or a cheap trinket or a gaudy photoshopped message imposed on a water-colour female goddess as affirmation; they want to have the same life chances as men, they want to live fuller lives in the same measure as men, they want the same sense of freedom and entitlement that men have, they want the same income for the same job as men get and they certainly don't want to be trapped in an endless cycle of mundane chores to support any man free of cost. My only plea this year is that as a society we need to discard the double-speak and not put women on a pedestal of a goddess only to have her sweep and mop it. Let's instead pledge that everyday of the year we will all see the work that women do as work that men ought also to be doing. Let's not think that women live to serve men and that marriage is an ultimate goal after which women can give up ambition. Let's not teach our young girls to compete with one another over males. Let's teach them that no one is entitled to their labour for free and that it is better to be financially independent than to be liked by one's husband and family. In fact, let us teach young girls that possessing ambition is not synonymous with marriage. The author is the Chief Coordinator of Research at The Hindu Centre for Politics and Public Policy"
92,Cultivation Under Contract: West Bengal shows the way in win-win potato farmer-corporate tie-up,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/cultivation-under-contract-west-bengal-shows-the-way-in-win-win-potato-farmer-corporate-tie-up-4561007/,2017-03-09,Indian Express,"Representational Image. (PTI Photo) Representational Image. (PTI Photo)This has been a terrible year for potato farmers, with prices everywhere  from Agra and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh to Burdwan in West Bengal  crashing to well below Rs 4 per kg levels. But about 10,000 growers in West Bengal have managed to realise an extra Rs 5 or so per kg, by supplying to the global snack and beverage giant PepsiCo under a contract farming initiative.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAt current rates of Rs 3.40-3.80 per kg for normal potatoes, farmers are grossing Rs 170-190 from every 50-kg sack that doesnt even cover production costs. However, some of us who have entered into collaborative farming with PepsiCo are being paid Rs 8.40 per kg. That works out to an extra Rs 230-250, compared to what we would have got by selling a sack of regular potatoes, points out Shantinath Nandi.This four-bigha (one acre) farmer from Anandapur village in Hooghly districts Goghat block under Arambag subdivision has been growing process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo for the last six years. He produces between 90 and 110 sacks of the tuber from each bigha, which gives Rs 42,000 at Rs 8.40 per kg. After deducting costs of Rs 22,000-25,000, it leaves a profit of Rs 17,000-20,000 per bigha or Rs 170-200 a sack. Had Nandi been growing ordinary table-grade potatoes, his total revenue itself would have been just Rs 170-190, not enough to take care of even cultivation costs of over Rs 200 per sack or Rs 4 per kg.The process-grade potato varieties such as Atlantic, FC3 and FC5, which PepsiCo is promoting, contain 20 per cent dry matter and 80 per cent water. Table varieties have about 85 per cent water. The lower dry matter content makes them less suitable for processing, as the extra water adds to dehydration and energy costs. Normal potatoes also have higher accumulation of reducing sugars. These, when fried, are subjected to certain enzymatic reactions, leading to their blackening. The resultant chips or fries tend to acquire a dark brownish colour, whereas ideally they should possess a light yellow hue.Shantinath Nandi, Asim Chowdhury and other farmers at Anandapur are among the many who have taken to cultivating process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo, under an arrangement where the Indian subsidiary of the American multinational undertakes to purchase their entire produce at a fixed price announced a month before planting.All they have to do is to grow the potatoes for us, says Jaideep Bhatia, director-agro at PepsiCo India.The maker of Lays and Uncle Chipps potato chips brands does contract cultivation  collaborative farming is the term it prefers to use  in Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, its direct farm sourcing operations are spread across nine districts: Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar.In 2010, our procurement was 39,998 tonnes from West Bengal. This year, we will do 72,250 tonnes. This programme is a big success for us, claims Bhatia. He adds that PepsiCo not only provides farmers with disease-free true potato seeds produced from its laboratory in Punjab, but also tractor-drawn planters and other equipment, crop protection and extension services, cold storage and insurance facilitation.Ive been working with this company for the last 5-6 years and there is certainly increased interest among growers for this kind of cultivation, notes Chandicharan Mondal, a potato aggregator, who has brought 200-odd farmers under PepsiCos programme.But the quantities being procured by PepsiCo and other food processing majors are only a fraction of the 10 million tonnes annual potato production of West Bengal alone. While contract cultivation of processing-grade potatoes is useful, there are limits to how much these can replace the normal aloo used in day-to-day meals and table preparations. And to that extent, the woes of growers cannot be wished away.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Strangely, the slide in the wholesale price failed to have any impact on retail market. The retail price rose gradually from Rs 6 to Rs 10 in some markets till Monday.Demonetisation, bumper production in states like UP and Punjab and bumper crop in Bengal collectively have left Bengal's farmers in a tight spot. The shortage of cash and excess supply have hit demand, resulting in a dip in prices. Farmers stare at a huge loss as most of them have taken loans from mahajans at a high interest rate keeping in mind the profits made in 2015-16. ""There was low yield in 2015-16. The retail prices rose up to Rs 24 per kg in city markets,"" said Gour Das of Purshura, a potato farmer, who took loan at a high interest rate and now finds it difficult to recover production cost.It's a mystery how the wholesale potato price and the retail price become inversely proportional. While the potato wholesale prices plunge, retail prices rise. Potato traders blamed the 6-tier middlemen system working between the wholesalers and retailers and higher margin of profit by a retailer as reasons for the price mismatch. On Monday, the wholesale price in Hooghly, Burdwan and Bankura  three major potato-producing districts  ranged between Rs 2.5 and Rs 3. Farmers fear that if the trend continues, the prices may plunge to as low as Rs 1 per kg.There is severe shortage of cash flow in the potato market. Besides, several big businessmen, a sizeable number of teachers, government employees and professionals invest in potato. ""They buy from the farmers and put the same in the cold storage, expecting a good price at the end of the season. However, demonetisation and this year's bumper production desisted them from investing in this sector,"" said Arup Dutta, an agro-economist.""While the total potato yield in 2015-16 in Bengal was 90 lakh tonnes, this year it has shot up to 1.15 crore tonnes,"" said potato merchant Biswarup De. He said that last year both the potato merchants and cold storage owners sustained heavy loss due to demonetisation as most of the transaction in the business is done in cash.Agriculture minister Purnendu Bose said, ""We observe March 14 as Krishi Diwas.

Sure enough, this budget has done it.The subsidy bill is projected to be Rs24,000 crore, up 30% from last year. The subsidy increase has been across the full spectrum of government activities.Subsidies extended to ailing ESCOMs, which account for almost half the subsidy bill, went up by 22%. The political hot potato of making even rich Bengalureans pay more for the electricity they consume was left untouched.Food subsidy saw a massive jump of 75%. This was chiefly due to the expansion of the scope of the Anna Bhagya Scheme. A related populist move was the announcement of one Namma Canteen for each of the 198 wards in Bengaluru. This intervention will adversely impact Bengaluru's vibrant darshinis and gaadis that already cater to a variety of price points.The streak of populism entered the domain of higher education as well. Free laptops have been announced for 1.5 lakh colle ge students.Here, Karnataka has finally joined Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and other states in extending freebies at the expense of taxpayers.In spite of all these populist impulses, the budget did not abandon all sense.For one, the allocation on long-term investment grew by an admirable 29%, including healthy increases on irrigation, flood control and water supply infrastructure.The budget speech included quite a few promising announcements. A growing state like Karna taka with an increas ingly complex econ omy needs smaller administrative units to take care of local needs.

The market is abuzz with products fashionably advertised as organic  from daily consumables like shampoos and soaps to offbeat designer clothes! The word organic is ad nauseam and some products slyly pass off as inherently good just because they are simply tagged so. Now, here is the dilemma when buying. How much organic is too organic; because organic products usually cost more.It seems people world over are leading robust lives and eating healthy; but they are unwittingly ingesting insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides, molluscicides, nematicides, plant growth regulators among others. There is way too much chemicals in food chains than is good. These compounds synthesised artificially to boost productivity in modern scientific farms are ALL toxic. Crop yields have increased dramatically but unscrupulous practices have left behind a lethal cocktail of dangerous compounds. They are an inseparable part of common lifestyles, food preferences and diets. Many studies link pesticides in foods with various ailments without doubt, from IQ loss to cancer! It is now an obvious no brainier to prefer nutritious and safe organic foods for long-term wellness.Many plant-based foods are industrially produced with genetically modified technologies or retailed with high residual pesticides. Based on the 2015 Report of the Environmental Working Group (EWG), an O-List (Organic Must Buy List!) was published. These are highly recommended edibles that should be bought organic even if they dent monthly food budgets. Here are some pointers that will make extra spend on organic alternates worthwhile at the grocers.Fruits with thin skins like apples, peaches, pears, grapes and strawberries are all on the O-List. Research publications show that 99% of apples contain at least one residual pesticide ... and 15 different types of pesticides are typically found on grapes.When it comes to veggies, the dirtiest are potatoes and spinach. It seems definitely worthwhile to go organic on these household staples. Also on the veggie O-list are ladies finger, tomatoes, cucumber, corn, capsicum and most other leafy greens.Dairy products like milk, cheese and yogurt rank high on the O-list. Certified organic dairy products are from cows and buffaloes reared entirely on organic feeds without antibiotics or growth hormones. Non-vegetarians must beware that conventional meat contains all these deadly chemicals in good measure. After all most cows, chicken, and other animals are reared with additives to spur meat production in commercial enterprises intent to maximise returns on investment.It seems only fair to counter the O-list with a clean-list of foods where it is just fine and safe to buy conventional such as bananas, which have a thick skin. Others include watermelon, pineapple, papaya, musk melon, mangoes and kiwi. Vegetables like drumsticks, onions, cauliflower, cabbage (red/white or purple), brinjal, peas, pumpkin, gourds, mushrooms and sweet potatoes find mention here. Amongst the less common vegetables included in the clean list are avocadoes and asparagus.So there we have it folks: O-list vs clean-list! Choose smartly and keep your wallet happy!"

The storms are being caused by a warming of the surface waters in the Pacific Ocean and are expected to continue for another two weeks.Perus government said that 374 people were killed in 1998 during a similar period of massive rains and flooding caused by rains blamed on the El Nino climate pattern. On Saturday, Prime Minister Fernando Zavala updated the number of dead from the latest flooding to 72.

105,Varanasi appeals to stomach and soul,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/varanasi-appeals-to-stomach-soul/articleshow/57712478.cms,2017-03-19,The Times Of India,"Every year Varanasi plays host to thousands of tourists hoping to discover their spiritual side. That has been the temple town's calling card and commerce. But foodies know that Varanasi's crowded streets and bylanes are also avenues of gastronomic delights. Many famous hawkers appear with their pushcarts in the evening. Some don't even have a signboard. Hygiene isn't their forte. But their offerings -- golgappas, rasedar pakoras, lassi - are addictive and available at a price that would buy you only a snigger in a city like Delhi.Quality street food, to anybody who pursues it like an obsessive lover, isn't just about feeling good. The best snacks take you into an unchartered zone where the taste buds groan with delight. It's like discovering an unknown erogenous zone. In their own way, the street-side hawkers of Varanasi are everyday artists in the business of producing and peddling pleasure.You might get that kind of feeling wolfing down Lalman's golgappas, or paani puris, sold from a handcart in a bylane near Lahurabir Chowk. What makes them irresistible isn't the tangy tamarind water but the filling, a slushy mix of chickpea, boiled potato and spices. He also serves a sweet version of the snack that feels almost like a dessert. Like most golgappa sellers in the city, the stuff he serves is customized to the amount of spicy heat your tastebuds can handle. Varanasi is a city of paan eaters. A long-lasting love affair with the paan makes a tongue hypersensitive to spice. This is primarily due to the use of chuna (lime), an essential ingredient for paan; hence the adjustment.Like Lalman, there are several other artistes of the palate strewn across the city, which is now Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's Lok Sabha constituency. One of the go-to places for breakfast is the late Chhanni Devi's, who sold puri-sabji and jalebis from a rundown shop in Lanka area, near BHU. Popularly known as ""Chachi"", she showered abuse on customers asking her to hurry up; the customers, in turn, were addicted to her rantings.Among the famous who graced the place was superstar Rajesh Khanna. The sabji served with the puri is made of pumpkin, potatoes and black gram. There is a rhythm with which her son Kailash Yadav flattens and shapes the dough before it is deep-fried, twice. The shop opens at 3.30 am. ""We start serving jalebis by 5 am and puri-sabji by 6. By 11.30 am, we are through,"" he says. A plate of four puris and sabji costs Rs 24.Adjacent are three shops selling lassi, all run by sons of Panna Sardar who ran the legendary original Pehalwan lassi. This is the third generation in the business. Lassis, with a dash of malai and saffron on top, are sold in clay cups. Some are so thick you almost need to chew.A kulhar (clay cup) of lassi is about beauty in minimalism. No frills; just the best of natural ingredients: curd made of buffalo milk, sugar and a hint of rosewater or saffron. It's part of the city's living heritage, created and consumed every day, sustained by a commitment to tradition. Places like these created a popular expression called 'Lanketing', going specifically to Lanka for snacks.Then there's Pappu's, the legendary tea stall in Assi mohalla that serves milk and lemon tea. The political gyan is free. The lemon tea here is flavoured with Hajmola, giving it a distinct whiff of heeng (asafoetida).There's much more. Near Lahurabir Chowk stands Jwala Prasad 's push cart selling rasedar pakora made of gram flour (besan), spinach and spices. The three are kneaded into a ball, deep fried and dipped in a fiery curry. Then it's served with a sprinkling of sohal, a salty savoury. The pakoras have two variations: sada and rangeen. The rangeen version is stuffed with bhang, a popular intoxicant generally laced with sweets.At Chetganj, Umashankar Sahu's family has been selling kachoris for three generations. As a peddler, Sahu has the smallest of stands where he keeps the kachoris, a little larger than a Rs 10 coin, garnished with shredded radish and carrot, and served with tamarind chutney.Varanasi is also famous for its sweets to which the city's Bengalis have also made a singular contribution. Shops with signs of desi and Bengali mithai can be seen. Some shops located around Pucca Mohal area along the ghats, sell their stuff only between 7 pm to 2 am. On offer are sweets suggestively named: Palangtod (Bed-breaker) and Malaipuri.One has deliberately avoided referring to the iconic Kashi and Deena Chat Bhandars at Godowlia Chowk which are more established joints. Crowds, including tourists, throng to Deena for a taste of their tamatar chaat, a rather unique snack which uses tomatoes ingeniously and which is eaten out of kullars. In the winter, chura matar, dripping with desi ghee, is the rage.Sometimes one wonders why food doesn't figure in the narrative of the holy city. Is it because it is primarily a business of yadavs and baniyas, who don't figure high in the city's intellectual story? There is no simple answer.What one does know is that there is a self-confidence to Varanasi; the way it looks at life, culture, and itself. The eternal city seems to stand a little above everything it surveys. There is a rhythm to its existence that's yet unspoiled by the ravages of time. And food is an inseparable part of it."

Though there is a scope for bettering the state balance sheet, its fiscal situation is not as bad as some states, the chamber said.The top priority of the new government should be to drastically improve the quality and quantity of power supply in the ensuing summer. Like several parts of the country, the challenge is not as much generation and availability of power but the financial health of the power utilities, mostly in the state ownership.The new government should immediately take recourse to the UDAY scheme of the Centre and bring the state utility to robust health so that the users in both rural and urban areas are given better power supply. As is provided in the new scheme of things, fresh investment should be made in separate supply channels to the farmers who, for welfare reasons, have to be given the electricity supply at the concessional rates and the financial load can be taken by the state government, rather than the individual power utility.""Being an agricultural state, Uttar Pradesh has a huge potential in diverse agro activities like live stock, milk production and processing, food processing . For instance, abundant supply of potatoes in districts like Kannauj and mango in areas like Maliabad, need a modern processing facilities which should be encouraged in the private sector by way of fiscal and other support. Likewise, lot more agro hubs and mandis should be built in the state,"" ASSOCHAM Secretary General D S Rawat said.As of now, the state produces about 360-400 lakh tonnes per annum and is the number one producer of milk in the country.The state has several large sized cities like Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Allahabad, Noida, Agra, Meerut, Moradabad, Meerut which need to be modernized and upgraded in terms of infrastructure. While initiatives like metro rail have been taken, they must be enlarged and lot more investment be made in city infrastructure including sanitation, drinking water, urban waste management.""A drive down the state presents a bad picture of heaps of plastics not only in cities but also in villages, creating an environment hazards, including the ground water,"" the chamber said. Since the same BJP is now in power in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, a better coordination should be achieved between the two states to give a better deal to the Bundelkhand areas which have suffered for long due to water scarcity and general backwardness."

The year-and-a-half-old child had swallowed a piece of plastic that got lodged at the entrance of the wind pipe and nearly choked him to death.Alfaz Khan was having potato chips at home on Tuesday, when he swallowed the piece of plastic. But unaware, his parents, Kajal Biwi and Amirul Khan, could not fathom why he was suddenly having difficulty breathing. When Kajal put her finger in his mouth, she felt the edge of the plastic but could not pull it out. The couple took the child to Chittaranjan Sishu Sadan near Hazra where they were sent to the OPD. Doctors there allegedly said the child had chest congestion, nebulised him, gave medicine for cold and discharged him. Alfaz again had difficulty breathing at night.The next morning, the Khans took Alfaz back to Sishu Sadan. ""We told the doctors something was lodged in his throat but they denied it and treated him with medicine and oxygen at the OPD. They also told us we could take him to SSKM Hospital if his condition relapsed,"" alleged grandfather Salam Ali Khan.Back home, as the child turned blue, the family took him to SSKM that night. On checking, ENT doctors at the emergency found a red plastic sheet near Alfaz's vocal cord and immediately operated on him. ""The plastic was stuck below the vocal cord at the sub-glottic region. Around 1am, we conducted bronchostomy, a micro-surgery to remove the plastic piece. Any delay could have cost him his life,"" said Dr Arunabha Sengupta, ENT head at SSKM.Sishu Sadan administration has ordered a probe."

VenkatachalapathyC_VENKATACHALAPATHYThe sweltering heat has made many vegetables dearer in the Fort City.Traders say there has been a slight rise in prices in the last few days.According to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, the price of most vegetables has gone up by Rs. 1 to Rs. 2 per kg.As Mr. Balu puts it, In the summer, many vegetables perish easily and so the cost of perishable vegetables has doubled. This includes beans, broad beans ( avarakkai ) and cauliflower.A kg of beans now cost Rs. 40 to Rs. 60, while broad beans cost Rs. 30 and cauliflower costs Rs. 20, he points out.Tomatoes too are turning out to be expensive. From Rs. 8 a kg last month, the price has gone up to Rs. 15, and is now Rs. 20, he said.When summer is here, vegetable production will be hit and subsequently supply will be affected. With acute water shortage across the State, farmers will most likely find it hard to cultivate crops and yield a good harvest. Also, there has been an increase in pest attacks on the produce over the last few summers.Combination of factorsAll these factors, coupled with the increase in fuel prices and transportation cost have led to a rise in prices, he said.Earlier, a bag of 60-70 kg of cabbage cost Rs. 300 to Rs. 350 in the wholesale market. Now, it costs Rs. 500, he said. Onions offer some solace for customers as the price ranges between Rs. 8 and Rs. 16 in the retail market.Small onions are sold for Rs. 25 to Rs. 40, while the local variety of brinjal (thorny) is priced at Rs. 30 a kg. Drumstick is sold at Rs. 20 kg, while potatoes cost Rs. 16 to Rs. 18.Good quality peas are sold at Rs. 40, while yam costs Rs. 25. The cost of other vegetables such as snake gourd, bitter gourd and green chillies ranges between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20 and ginger is sold at Rs. 40. Second-grade carrots cost between Rs. 20 and Rs. 25, Mr. Balu said.With summer heat rising, the cost of vegetables will only go up in the coming weeks.The prices of vegetables will continue to increase in the next 15 to 20 days, Mr. Balu said."

112,"Direct transfer, 2 lakh sale points: Big fertiliser subsidy reform rollout in June",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/direct-transfer-2-lakh-sale-points-big-fertiliser-subsidy-reform-rollout-in-june-4581320/,2017-03-22,Indian Express,"The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer.Buoyed by its landslide win in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Narendra Modi government has decided to fast-track the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system for payment of fertiliser subsidy to farmers.From the coming kharif season, beginning June, the Rs 70,000-crore fertiliser subsidy budgeted for 2017-18 will be disbursed to companies based on actual sales to farmers captured on point-of-sale (POS) machines installed at nearly two lakh retail points across India.This would be a significant change from the current system, where firms are paid the subsidy on receipt of their fertiliser at the railhead point or any approved godown of a district. Prior to this, till October 2012, they were getting the subsidy on despatch of material from their respective factories.From kharif 2017 onwards, we are moving to disbursal of subsidy only after sale to the farmer takes place. The farmers identity will be verified through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, voter ID or Kisan Credit Card. The sale transaction as well as buyer details would be captured in the POS machine installed at the retailers end and connected with a central server, a Department of Fertilisers official told The Indian Express.The proposed subsidy-post-sale system  as opposed to after receipt-at-district or despatch-from-plant  is already being implemented as a pilot scheme in 17 districts. They include UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home district of Gorakhpur; Kishanganj and Begusarai (Bihar); Dhanbad (Jharkhand); Hoshangabad (Madhya Pradesh); Pali (Rajasthan); Nashik and Raigad (Maharashtra); Narmada (Gujarat); Krishna and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh); Ranga Reddy (Telangana); Tumkur (Karnataka); Thrissur (Kerala); Karnal and Kurukshetra (Haryana); and, Una (Himachal Pradesh).We will have a nationwide roll-out of this system from June 1. Fertiliser companies have been given a deadline of May 31 for procurement and installation of POS machines at all the 1.98 lakh-odd registered outlets selling to farmers. All transactions thereafter will have to be done through POS machines in order to be able to claim subsidy, the official said.The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. A farmer growing wheat or paddy may apply up to three 50-kg bags of urea, one bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and half-a-bag of muriate of potash (MOP) per acre. That requirement could be more  say, three bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and MOP per acre  for potato and sugarcane.But under the new system, it is possible to record transactions at individual farmer-level. If someone is buying 200 bags of urea, that person is more likely to be a plywood or particle board manufacturer than a farmer. Either way, he isnt deserving of subsidy.Neem-coating has already helped check illegal diversion of a highly-subsidised fertiliser towards non-agricultural use. The linking of subsidy payment to data generated at retail sale point leaves virtually no scope for diversion that is always possible from the godown or rail rake point, the official said. Nor can fertilisers be smuggled from border areas to Bangladesh or Nepal, since there will be no POS machines there for recording sales and claiming subsidy.The fertiliser industry has cautiously welcomed the proposed reform. I want this to succeed, as it is an important first step that should culminate in the subsidy being transferred directly to farmers bank accounts, which is what DBT is ultimately about, said Suresh Krishnan, managing director, Zuari Global Ltd, a leading urea and phosphatic fertiliser marketer.The industrys main apprehension is on the preparedness of retailers to accurately record not just farmers details and quantities purchased, but also the company/unit supplying the material in each case. The fact that fertiliser sales are also concentrated over just few months (June-August and October-December) of the year only complicates matters further. Add to this the possibility of the POS device not working due to network connectivity or signal strength problems, it could be a recipe for chaos during the peak agricultural season.We are also concerned over timely subsidy payment. As it is, the industry is owed Rs 40,000 crore of unpaid subsidy bills carried forward each year, entailing an annual interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore for which there is no reimbursement. If payment of subsidy will now happen only after actual sale of material to the farmer, it will add to our working capital costs, said Satish Chander, director-general, Fertiliser Association of India.Under the proposed system, payment of subsidy is to be based on weekly settlement of claims from actual sales data captured on POS machines. The industry will be happy if it really happens that way. We have supported this scheme, so much so that the entire cost of procuring and installing the two lakh POS devices (about Rs 400 crore) is being borne by us. We only want that it should lead to the implementation of DBT in the true sense of the subsidy going directly to the farmers, said Chander.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In this effort, it has offered to act as a mediator.Addressing a gathering of potato growers in Buh village near Harike, Tarn Taran deputy commissioner D P S Kharbanda said that the administration would arrange for a visit of farmers to chips manufacturing projects installed under the agriculture technology management agency (ATMA) and those who would be interested in setting up their own units would be provided loans with up to 33% subsidy.For the past one month, potatoes are being sold for Rs 2-3 per kg in the wholesale market and were available in retail for Rs 10 per kg. Many potato growers had even ploughed their produce due to steep decline in rates.Kharbanda stated that he had instructed the agriculture department to prepare a list of farmers interested in having their own food processing projects. He further said that the district administration had directed the district education officer to purchase potatoes from farmers for Rs 5 per kg for midday meal scheme.On the issue of lack of storage facility in schools, he said the agriculture department had been asked to ensure storage of potatoes in the godowns near these schools."

So far I have sent two bulk orders via Mumbai port to Sri Lanka and Mauritius.""According to MP cold chain industries association, about 65 per cent space in the cold storages is occupied with potatoes along with carrots, coriander, turmeric, jagerry and other vegetables.Traders said that availability of potatoes in the market is sufficient this year due to higher production. February to March is the peak harvesting season for potatoes and other rabi crops.MP cold chain industries association president Hansmukh Jain Gandhi said, ""In anticipation of higher prices, farmers have stocked huge volume of potatoes in cold storages to increase their shelf life.""Indore has maximum number of cold storage units in Madhya Pradesh. There are 75 cold storages in the Indore district, while there are a total 210 cold storages in state.Farmers keep potatoes in cold storages to increase their shelf life and usually take them out when prices go up in the retail market.A cold storage owner Rajiv Tuteja said, ""Prices of potatoes are likely to rule high this year because overseas demands are good. We expect potato prices to rise between Rs 12 and Rs 15 per kg from the current price of Rs 6 per kg."""
117,Cornering the Asian eatery,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/cornering-the-asian-eatery/article17670600.ece,2017-03-27,The Hindu,"Over a long lunch at Jia, which opened last month in Colaba, Neville Vazifdar and his wife, Michelle, spoke to us with passion and insight about the city's food scene and its evolving tastes.Vazifdar, who started Royal China in 2004, back when the only other alternative was China Garden, has seen to it that the restaurant grows in three locations  one each in Mumbai, Pune and Delhi (a fourth in Bandra is currently shuttered, though Vazifdar would like to reopen it as soon as we can). The restaurateurs new venture, Jia - The Oriental Kitchen, opened in Colaba last month. On the day we lunched there with Vazifdar, it was fast filling up with a mix of dating couples, regulars (yes, they already have people who have dined there three to four times), and curious families, on the first truly hot Saturday afternoon of 2017. The ever-expanding entrepreneur has just launched Kuai Kitchen, a quick service Asian eatery in the space formerly occupied by Sufra, the Middle Eastern restaurant by Moshe, on Colaba Causeway.Expanding the repertoireThe menu at Jia offers a mix of cuisines, from Japanese sushi  Its something that people want, theres no doubt about it in Bombay, asserts Vazifdar  to Chinese dim sum and more. Whats on offer reflects the changing tastes of diners, who want more than just Kung Pao potatoes and chicken in black bean sauce, its now Chilean sea bass dim sum and mushroom truffle rice.Its no surprise that the menu at Jia features both, the aforementioned dishes, along with a selection of large plates, a special vegetarian menu, and zingy cocktails for the citys perpetual summer. For Vazifdar, Jia is a chance to grow with the city, while also nudging diners to expand their horizons when it comes to ordering and eating Asian food. I dont think it would have been the right decision to continue to expand the Royal China brand but [rather we wanted to] experiment with new [dishes]. Because when youre already established in something. I think you got to just continue doing that, He says, adding, Then came the idea  okay, Royal China is established, its got its set clientele, but theres so much more that we can do, in terms of food, presentation and adding new dishes, that people want.As plates (sourced from Thailand), came piled with a crunchy prawn tempura sushi, light yet punchy salmon carpaccio, mock meat puffs and more, Vazifdar spoke at length about Mumbais restaurant culture  where diners want value, and consistency over all else. So, even while hes sourcing ingredients from abroad, like Berkshire pork from the U.K., sushi-quality fish from Japan, and chillies from Thailand, just to name three for Jia, the menu prices are comparable to other restaurants in the city. While talking about how he placed a special order for the crockery from Thailand, we learned that everything at Jia has been put together by both him and his wife, from crockery to supplier sourcing, tastings and more.Eccentric titbitsVazifdar, who clearly enjoys the food at his own restaurant, lets us in on a culinary quirk of his  he needs to eat egg fried rice with his Oriental meal, from the first bite itself. And while were tucking into edamame and truffle dumplings (made with a truffle paste, and not oil), we see Vazifdar helping himself to a moundful of rice to go with his food. He explains that earlier, when on sourcing trips to China, hed politely wait for the rice to come at the end of every meal. But as the visits got more frequent, hed explain to his partners in the Middle Kingdom that hed like the rice ordered at the same time as the dim sum and small plates.Expounding on the thinking behind Jia, Vazifdar said, Chinese food has a huge variety of things and we can incorporate so many new items, which are different to what we are doing. Even dim sum uses more specialised ingredients, more imported meat  for which there is a niche in the market. So that is how we made this menu. Citing the example of Chilean sea bass, he said, You couldnt get it, it wasnt there [in the market], in the days when Royal China started, now its readily available.Edible overlapsA canny businessman, Vazifdar also addressed the fact that Jia and Royal China are both located quite close to each other. Is he worried that one will cannibalise sales of the other? He said, There are two answers to that. One is that no, I am not competing, because the food here [at Jia] is very different to what were giving there [at Royal China]. The second thing is, even if I were to give the same food for that matter, either I do it or someone else will come and do it. Then that guy will be taking the money home, here Im taking the money home. We listened intently while using chopsticks to guide pieces of forest honey marinated sea bass onto our plate, with prawns in a sweet and sour sauce, which we gladly ate with earthy mushroom fried rice with truffle oil that included shimeji and enoki mushrooms.Over the years, Vazifdar has learned that restaurants are, the ideal place for social experiments, as he has used vouchers and other inducements to test out everything, from pricing to loyalty and more. Giving an example, he cites the large home-delivery business of Royal China, and said that on a whim, he sent off Rs. 500 coupons on a particular night, that have to be redeemed within a set amount of time. As the expiry neared, sales shot up, as customers didnt want to lose out on the deal.For the rest of the year, without giving specifics, Vazifdar said, Weve got a lot of things happening; we just basically want to think of continuously opening things now. Bombay is a good market, and [by] having different brands under our wing, we can choose which brand [to open] in which [part of the city]. His expansion plans are limited to Mumbai for the moment.Even with his team in place, he still likes to be able to walk into his restaurants and check on them. Vazifdar believes that it takes constant personal supervision and interest to maintain and build the level of consistency that keeps people coming back.Jia - The Oriental Kitchen, Colaba; 6156 2222Kuai Kitchen, Colaba; 33126018"

The situation may turn worse in the coming days owing the truckers strike, as 80 per cent vegetables are imported from other states and neighbouring cities, vegetable vendors and officials say.Summer is the time when vegetables are sold at high price which is evident if the prices are compared from last week to present.With summer, the vegetable prices automatically go up due to low production of non-seasonal vegetables and similarly this time also the prices have increased like every year. There are chances of further increase in the prices of vegetables by next week and the effect can be more if the truckers strike continues, said G Prasad, estate officer of Kancharapalem rythu bazaar.Almost 80 per cent of vegetables are imported from various states and this strike will affect the prices of the vegetables brought from those regions. Mainly onions, potatoes, beans, ginger, garlic, capsicum, pointed gourd, chillies and beetroot. The strike might cause a rise of Rs 2-4 more in the vegetables, Prasad added.The stocks of onions and potatoes are good now. Going by the present scenario we can say that the prices might not go up much this time unlike the previous years as the onions touched Rs 80 a kg but later we cannot say. We came to know about the strike, which might definitely impact us and customers, said Shiva Narayana, a shopkeeper at Kancharapalem rythu bazaar.Trucks go off road on day-1 of strikeVisakhapatnam: With the indefinite lorry strike called by South Indian Motor Transport (SIMTA) on Thursday, 7,000 lorries, in this district, went off the roads.While the transporters are opposing steep increase of 40 per cent in Third Party Premium (TPP) for commercial vehicles, they are seeking withdrawal of the Centres order on the increased third party insurance, challan fees and penal amounts.

Around 4 lakh transport vehicles in the State have stopped loading and unloading operations and joined the strike, said APLOA general secretary YV Eswara Rao. He stated that they had exempted emergency services like milk and water tankers from the strike. We will intensify our strike if the government neglects our demands, he said.Contrary to expectations, the lorry strike did not have any remarkable impact on the economy on the first day of the indefinite strike across the State. There was no effect on the prices of perishable goods such as vegetables and essential commodities. Oil filling station staff in Vijayawada and Guntur said they would fill fuel till the existing stocks last.When contacted, M Ramesh Babu, estate officer of Rythu Bazar in Patamata, said there was no problem in procuring vegetables on Thursday. Most of the vegetables come here in small trucks and autos which are not participating in the strike. Since Friday is a holiday for the market, there might be some problem on Saturday, if the strike continues. Even then, only a few vegetables like carrot, beetroot and potato which are transported by lorries will get dearer, he said.The lorry delivered vegetables in the morning as usual on Thursday. Most of us in the vegetable market are unaware of the strike. We have to wait and see how things will turn out on Friday. If the vehicle does not turn up, there might be a problem, said V Veerababu, a vegetable vendor at Kaleswara Rao Market in the city.Speaking to TNIE, Andhra Pradesh Federation of Petroleum Dealers (APFPD) president R Gopala Krishna made it clear that petrol dealers are not participating in the indefinite strike and it is only limited to transport operators. Only 2 per cent of petrol tankers operated in the State on Thursday and the total operation will be stopped from April 1.Though there will be no impact on diesel sales, two-wheelers might face a harrowing time from Friday with insufficient stock of petrol at the filling stations. The indefinite strike of transport operators will be a great loss to the government rather than the operators, he said."

It networks the existing agricultural produce marketing committees to create a unified market for agricultural commodities. Officials said Koraput is one of the 10 districts to be included under e-NAM.According to officials, in the first phase ginger and potato produced in the district have been included under e-NAM and traders can buy those through online bidding. Till date, 1,700 farmers of the district are growing ginger and potato and 51 traders have registered with e-NAM. The highest bidder will be allowed to purchase the commodity if the farmer agrees to the price, said Susant Kumar Padhi , secretary regional market committee, Koraput.It is expected that through online bidding of products, the monopoly of local traders will be checked in determining the price of a product and the farmers will get the highest price for their products, he added. Anyone from across the country can obtain a license to participate in the online bidding process by paying fee of Rs 1,100 at the respective market committee.According to official data available annually, around 20 tonne of ginger and eight tonne of potato are grown by farmers in the district. Also, farmers are optimistic that through online bidding they will financially benefit and will not be forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices. ""Last year, we sold ginger at Rs 8 a kg to local traders but in bordering Andhra Pradesh it was sold at Rs 35 to 40 a kg. However, through online bidding we are hopeful to get the maximum profit for out products,"" said Chandra Chepadi, a ginger grower of Bodotema village under Pottangi block, who has registered with e-NAM.Apart from Koraput, the e-NAM project will be operational at Puri, Nayagarh, Cuttack, Balangir, Sambalpur, Nabarangpur, Gajapai, Rayagada and Phulbani districts.

However, the situation might change, if the strike continues, warn experts.As many as three lakh lorries in the State went off the roads from Thursday pressing for their demands which include withdrawal of the Centres order increasing the third-party insurance and high toll tax collection on State highways. Though the lorry owners association has exempted essential services like milk, medicines, water and petrol from the purview of the stir, some sections of petrol tank operators have joined the stir across the State on Saturday.""Of the total 1,500 petrol tankers, only 500 were operated on the third day of the stir. Already the petroleum sales have dipped by 60 per cent from Monday, the petrol tankers association has also decided to join the stir in a full-fledged manner. If this happens, the petroleum users across the State might face a serious problem, said Andhra Pradesh Federation of Petroleum Dealers (APFPD) president R Gopala Krishna.Speaking to Express, Rythu Bazar estate officer M Ramesh Babu said that indefinite lorry strike has no impact on the vegetable prices. Most of the vegetables are procured from the nearby villages across the city through auto rickshaws and APSRTC buses. Moreover, the vegetable prices are slashed by Rs 5 on each variety as this is the harvesting season for all the horticulture crops, he said.Veggies turn dearer as arrivals declineThe prices of vegetables also remained stable in Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Rajamahendravaram, but the situation was different in Kurnool. The strike has created artificial scarcity of essential commodities, especially vegetables and their prices are going skyward.As Kurnool city depends on vegetable imports from places like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and other places, the supply constraints due to lorry strike burnt holes in the pockets of consumers.Kurnool imports potato and ginger from Delhi, Agra, Gujarat and nearly 100 tonnes arrives every day to the local markets. Because of strike, potato prices have doubled from Rs 15 to Rs 30 per kg, while ginger too saw similar price hike from Rs 25 to Rs 50 per kg. Tomatoes which were regular imports from Kadapa, Chittoor and Mahabubnagar districts also had its prices doubled from Rs 15 per kg."

Owners have invested money to realise a dreamBorivli is a suburb located along the western suburban line of Mumbai and has several eating joints, including themed restaurants. As one stands in front of the well-known Esspee Tower near the Borivli railway station, an aquarium shop, a rather big one, lit up well and spic and span, stands out.As one approaches the shop, the visitor would see Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd, one of the biggest aquarium shops of Mumbai and Caf Hydro, the first aquarium-themed caf in the country with the biggest fish tunnel.Such aquarium cafs or ocean restaurants are quite common in some of the big tourist destinations in the world. In India it is the first of its kind with a fish tunnel or an aquarium tunnel. In the country, there are several restaurants with an aquarium or a fish tank or an aquarium wall.For 41-year-old Rupesh Sakpal, the director of Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd and Caf Hydro, this was not the first time that he had made an aquarium tunnel. The dream project of Rupesh is at Rajendra Nagar at Dattapada Road at Borivli East. In fact, Borivli is a bustling tourist destination and a happening place in the suburbs. When the Taraporewala Aquarium on Marine Drive was refurbished a few years ago, Sakpals company was tasked to create a 180-degree acrylic glass tunnel of 10x15 sq feet.A restaurant was on the back of my mind. We thought why not to make it more interesting. An aquarium always attracts crowd. In fact, in a restaurant where there is a fish tank, people prefer to sit by its side and dine. I thought of giving a different experience altogether, said Rupesh, explaining his pet project.The 17x15 sq ft fish tunnel is at the level-2 of Caf Hydro. The level-3 has a huge wall aquarium. Setting this up was a challenge and we decided to give it a try, adds Rupeshs uncle Manohar Sakpal, who is the chairman and managing director of Bhagirathi Group.With a variety of colourful, exotic, big and small fish of over a dozen varieties gliding around and excellent lighting, you are in a different world. When you have a meal, there is nothing like it, said Shaibal Gupta, a foodie who had dined at Caf Hydro.Manohar supported Rupesh, who has a Bachelor of Fisheries Science degree, when he started a 100 sq ft aquarium shop on September 9, 1999, near the Borivli railway station. His three-storeyed aquarium shop and caf now are spread over 10,000 sq ft.The ground floor or level one is filled with youngsters and has a feel of Mumbais local trains. It has been constructed using train tracks, train floors, sleepers, racks, ladders and a blue-coloured staircase. The roof has several artwork and bottles.The one-stop pet mall restaurant has been set up at a cost of nearly Rs 25 crore. We have made investments to realise the dream. We are very clear that aquarium is our core business and everything will revolve around it, said Rupesh, who is also developing a public aquarium in Ranchi in Jharkhand. We have to look at hygiene and service and nearly 100 people work round the clock in three shifts, he said as he attended phone calls.After Caf Hydro was inaugurated on January 26 this year, the number of calls have increased. Several corporate houses want to visit, do group bookings or have a similar aquarium in their offices and workplaces, he said. Nowadays people are looking for what is known as a stress-buster aquarium.Paste food, which is made of proteins of fish, is the unique concept of this restaurant. There are variety of delicious dishes like fish bao, fish burger, fish hotdog, fish bullets, fish cake roll.I stay in Borivli and came to know about it and decided to visit the place. I found it interesting and it is something new.

We are paying out of our own pocket,"" said Kuldeep Tyagi of the BKA.Earlier, in March, the West Bengal government announced a support price of Rs 4.60/kg for potatoes and promised to buy 28,000 tonnes of potatoes, after the state faced a similar situation.The BJP Kisan Morcha actively campaigned for the provision of a support price in West Bengal. It has, however, so far, refrained from a similar campaign in UP.""The situation is same in UP. Farmers are only getting about Rs 200 per sack for potatoes. While his expenditure on cultivation, transportation and cold storage is much more. So, the farmer is in fact suffering losses. The state must announce a support price on potatoes, just like West Bengal. Farmers have been suffering and the government has not bothered to do anything,"" said Rakesh Tikait, BKU president.""When we include all costs involved in production, the total cost comes to Rs 7 per kg. The farmer is getting only Rs 3-4 kg in the market. So, there is a huge discrepancy. The government should announce a support price of atleast Rs 10 per kg"", said Pushpendra Singh, President of the KSS.Farmers are also disappointed that while the BJP's Kisan Morcha raised the same issue in West Bengal, it has failed to do so in UP, where it is in power. ""Politics supersedes everything it seems. It is an issue for the BJP in West Bengal, but not so in UP because they are in power themselves"", said Kuldeep Tyagi of the BKA.The BJP's Kisan Morcha on its part assured the farmers that the issue will be raised soon, and they too will demand a support price for potatoes. ""We agree that there should be a support price. We will raise the demand soon with the newly formed government"", said Naresh Sirohi, General Secretary of the BJP Kisan Morcha."

He directed the officials concerned to ensure that only 33 approved varieties of seeds are sold at monitored prices to prevent loss of crop on this account and also coordinate with neighbouring Haryana to ensure that the same quality seeds are sown in the region.Chairing a meeting of the agriculture department here, Amarinder said he would write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking price support to compensate the farmers for the loss incurred due to the difference between maizes market price of Rs 1,100 and the governments Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 1,300.Though the central government declares MSP for maize, it does not directly buy the produce, he said.The Chief Minister directed the agriculture department to explore the possibility of tying up with a commodities exchange or set up an exchange for trading of commodities like potato and cotton to ensure guaranteed sale and save farmers from distress selling, an official spokesperson said here.Amarinder expressed concern over declining cotton yields in the state due to whitefly infestation and told the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) to explore possibilities of introducing better quality Egyptian and Australian cotton varieties to increase profits.Referring to cotton as white gold of southern Malwa region, he underlined the need to educate farmers on the use of less insecticides and pesticides.Directing the officials concerned to ensure sale and use of only PAU-approved pesticides and recognised seeds, the Chief Minister said the agriculture department would need to reach out to 1,500 villages to educate the farmers and create awareness about the threat of whitefly.At the meeting, the agriculture department informed that it has sufficient quantities of seeds, pesticides and fertilizers for the coming crop season.Amarinder also directed the irrigation and power department to ensure regular supply of canal water and electricity supply from April 15.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The strike is set to enter the fourth day on Monday. While prices of some vegetables have crashed, there's glut of others because they aren't being lifted from the city and its neighbouring villages. Also, some vegetables have become dearer as they aren't being ferried to the city, leading to a shortage.""I got my last delivery of onions three days ago. I was supposed to receive another shipment on Monday, but now that doesn't seem likely,"" said Seyid, 21, a vendor in KR Market . While Seyid continued to sell onions at the same price as before, he said he might be forced to jack up the rates if he doesn't get new stock soon.Pushpa and Venkateshappa get their provisions from the Kalasipalya wholesale market. The couple normally trades in cauliflowers, drumsticks and carrots. ""It's very bad. We last got a delivery two days ago. We haven't been getting anything fresh. The cauliflowers have begun to rot. I usually sell each cauliflower head for Rs 25-30. Now, with everything spoiling, I wouldn't even get Rs 10 for a piece,"" said Pushpa, adding normally she would sell carrots and drumsticks for Rs 15-20 per kilo, but the prices have shot up to Rs 35-40 due to the strike.Pyarejaan, 64, who gets onions from the Yeshwanthpur APMC four times a week, said he hasn't faced any problem so far, but might in a couple of days when he'll run out of stock. Ibraz Khan, a wholesaler in Kalasipalya, gets his produce from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. While his prevailing stocks will last for a few days, he says he isn't receiving new shipments.""If there is a shortage of a particular vegetable, the price will rise. But if there is an excess, we'll have to lower the prices substantially,"" he said. ""Since truckers are on strike in south India, I'll have to pay Rs 5,000-15,000 extra to those ferrying potatoes from northern states,"" he added.Ilias, a potato, onion and garlic wholeseller, said that his stock will last only two more days. ""Price per bori (50kg sack) has gone up by Rs 50. Additionally, we were earlier selling onions at Rs 10 per kg; now the price has increased to Rs 15,"" he said.""As of now vans and tempos seem to be doing most of the transporting, something that may not be sustainable in the long run as they aren't equipped for inter-state deliveries,"" he added.Vendors in Russel Market were largely unaware of the ongoing strike and said business is continuing as usual. Aslam Amin, a vendor, said three tempos come from the City Market every day with his stock, and that the strike hasn't disrupted this schedule. ""Our stock will last for another week, so we haven't been affected. However, if the strike continues, we might have a problem,"" said Mushtaq Ahmed, a vendor who gets his vegetables from Yeshwantpur and Kalasipalya markets.Noor, a small-time vendor, gets 10-15 kg of each vegetable every day, but received his last shipment two days ago. ""If this goes on, I won't have anything to sell,"" he said.Truckers are protesting the Centre's move to scrap old vehicles and levy toll on state highways, and are demanding a reduction in third-party premium paid to insurance firms.Not in a mood to relent, truckers intensified their strike on Sunday with nearly 23 lakh vehicles transporting important commodities staying off the roads.G R Shanmugappa, president of the Karnataka State Lorry Owners and Agents Association, said they'd continue their protest till they get a response from the central government and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).""Some 23 lakh trucks stayed off the roads on Sunday throughout the south zone. We have also got an assurance from LPG association workers that they'll support us in our protest. There are only three filling stations for the four southern states - in Mangaluru, Vizag and Salem and they have informed us that they'll not go in for filling. We are also in talks with petrol and diesel association workers who have said they will join us from Monday,"" he said.The truckers are protesting high insurance premiums and scrapping of old vehicles. According to Shanmugappa, private insurance companies are hand in glove with central government agencies as well as IRDA to ensure that decisions benefit them alone. ""They do this once a year. Hike the rates and wait for the money to flow in. They earn crores through this. But we'll not give up till we get some respite,"" he said.However, the truckers' leader said they had not interfered with the supply of certain crucial commodities. ""We have not disrupted transportation of some essential commodities like milk, medicines and water because we don't want the public to suffer. However, the supply of wheat flour, corn meal, finger millet and other foodgrains has been affected,"" he said.Commenting on the strike, chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday said that he has directed transport minister Ramalinga Reddy to hold meetings with the truckers' association to resolve the issue soon."

PTI PhotoDelivering on BJP's poll promise to small and marginal farmers, the Yogi Adityanath cabinet today decided to waive their crop loans up to Rs 1 lakh, totalling a staggering Rs 36,359 crore, at its very first meeting.The move will benefit over 2.15 crore farmers, besides 7 lakh others who had secured loans which turned into non- performing assets (NPAs).The Yogi Adityanath cabinet decided to float Kisan Rahat Bonds for raising Rs 36,359 crore required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers who form 92.5 per cent of the total 2.30 lakh farmers in the state.The decision comes a fortnight after Adityanath took over the reins of the state on March 19 after BJP and its allies stormed to power in the 403-member Assembly capturing 325 seats, an over three-fourth majority.Briefing mediapersons after a 90-minute meeting of the cabinet, senior minister Siddharth Nath Singh and Srikant Sharma said Rs 30,729 crore was required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers.Besides, there were about 7 lakh other farmers who had taken loans which turned into non-performing assets ((NPAs). In order to bring them back into the mainstream, their outstanding dues of Rs 5,630 crore have also been written off.The loan waiver promise was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and state party president Keshav Prasad Maurya and it is the duty of the government to fulfil the promise made in BJP's 'sankalp patra' (manifesto) and the Yogi government was moving ahead in this direction, the two ministers said.In the past, farmers in the state had suffered because of successive drought and hailstorm.Singh said Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act mandated that no state can allow its fiscal deficit to grow beyond three per cent of its GDP. Hence, funds for meeting the expenditure on loan waiver would be raised through Kisan Rahat Bonds.Taking into account the problems faced by potato growers, who face immense hardship in case of bumper crops, the cabinet decided to set up a three-member committe headed by Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to see how they can get adequate remuneration for their produce.The ministers said the committee will also look at how to help the potato growers.The ministers said the cabinet also decided to raise by Rs 10 per quintal the minimum support price for wheat procurement as loading and unloading charges. The MSP for wheat it Rs 1,680 per quintal.A target of 80 lakh metric tonnes of wheat procurement has been fixed for this season and, in the first phase, half of it will be procured, they said. The ministers said instructions have been issued to ensure direct procurement from farmers and that they should not be harassed.In order to check illegal mining, the cabinet decided to constitute a group of ministers. The GoM headed by Maurya will give its report in a week.The ministers said the cabinet also took up the issue of investments in UP for setting up industries so the youth get better employment opportunities in the state itself.For this, a five-member GoM headed by another Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma has been constituted. It would visit other states and study their industrial policies.The GoM will study the policies of BJP-ruled states like Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh among others for preparing an industrial policy for UP for enhanced investment through a single window system."

Prices are expected to rise in the coming two months if there is no relief.A kg of beans is presently being sold at Rs. 100 plus in the retail market, while carrots are being sold at around Rs. 80 a kg. Beans are presently being cultivated only in Malur region, where too, the crop has been severely hit.Brinjals are being sold at an unprecedented Rs. 60 plus levels a kg. The prices of greens and cucumber  much in demand during summer have also seen a big jump in their prices. A measure of sabbakki greens is presently sold at a whopping Rs. 105.All the gourds are trading at high rates. Other vegetables like ladys finger, beetroot and radish are also being sold at higher than usual rates at Rs. 38, Rs. 40 and Rs. 32 respectively. Coconut prices have been trading at the higher end of Rs. 30-Rs. 33 for the past two months and has seen no correction.A senior procurement official at a leading retail chain in the city said that the chief problem had been fall in supplies. Some of the vegetables like gourds, cauliflower, beetroot and others are of very poor quality and even if one is ready to pay more, there is no quality product available in the market, he said.S.H. Keshav, manager, procurement and marketing, Hopcoms, said the arrival of most of the vegetables have fallen by over 40% and if the pre-monsoon rain failed in the coming months, the vegetable market would only head further northwards.G. Muniswamy Gowda, a vegetable farmer from Chennarayapatna on the city outskirts said, water scarcity and rising temperature had hit the crops severely. The water levels in the borewells have fallen in the last one month and there isnt enough water available for the crops. It is for the first time in the last many years that we are not cultivating our full 8 acres of land, but only a part of it, he said.The only vegetables to be trading at affordable prices are onions and potatoes which are below Rs. 20 a kg. The climate is now apt for onions and the market is being flooded with a good supply, said a leading onion merchant at the APMC Yard in Yeshwanthpur. Though tomatoes are being sold at Rs. 25-Rs. 27 a kg, they are of a poor quality, said a wholesaler trader."

Wholesale traders noted that the market received only 220 truckloads of vegetables against its daily share of 300 lorries on Monday. This had led to short supply of vegetables such as carrot, brinjal, beans and beetroot.Lorries mainly from southern parts of the State refrained from transporting goods even though the Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners Federation had announced that essential goods supply would not be affected. Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced this sop to bolster Trinamool's position ahead of next year's panchayat polls, following BJP 's spectacular victory in Uttar Pradesh The decision would cost the government anything between Rs 120 crore and Rs 200 crore. ""The kharif crop has suffered, potato farmers are making distress sales. We are ready to bear the pain despite our financial constraints. Let the Centre show some gesture by waiving farm loans,"" Banerjee said after the administrative meeting held at Kharagpur on Monday.According to sources, the CM's farmland tax waiver doesn't apply to the agricultural cess that applies to all landholders irrespective of their holdings. As of now, small farmers having a holding of 4 acres in irrigated areas or 6 acres in rain-fed areas have been kept outside the agricultural tax ambit. But they have to pay agricultural cess like others. The cess is likely to continue.The salaried class may fret, but the decision sounds more political than economic. Banerjee, who has been accusing the Centre of discriminating against Bengal, has used this sop to take the wind out of BJP's sails.""I don't mind Andhra Pradesh getting a special package from the Centre. But Bengal was denied its due on the Backward Region Grants Fund (BRGF) in Jangalmahal. The Rs 1900-crore Ghatal Master Plan is awaiting the Centre's nod. Why this discrimination? Why are banks sitting on projects submitted by self-help groups? The Centre has to give money to the people, not just go on riot-mongering,"" the CM said.Banerjee said her government had covered as many as 11,000 beneficiaries in West Midnapore under several state government schemes. She also handed over the first 50,000-rupee compensation cheque to a person who lost his job and returned home after demonetisation.While announcing the sops, Banerjee wanted the people to make a promise. ""Wadah koro  danga nehi karunga (make a promise you will not take part in riots),"" the CM said in a bid to combat the saffron challenge days ahead of the Ram Navami celebrations beginning in the state from Wednesday, when Hindu religious groups are planning an armed show of strength across the state.The chief minister also took note of polarisation. ""They are using social networking to spread rumours. Can you imagine, a Union minister has been claiming that the Trinamool government has stopped mangalarati in Dakshineswar temple? I request you to cross-check facts before making up your mind,"" she said.Taking on opposition CPM that has been alleging a nexus between the state government and the Centre, Banerjee gave it back to CPM. ""CPM and BJP are hand in glove. Many CPM activists are joining BJP. Do you know why? They think they can oust Mamata Banerjee by tying up with BJP. CPM has turned out to be BJP's main advisers. Those who are CPM in the morning turn BJP at night. They won't be able to remove us as long as people are with us,"" the CM said."

With summer in full swing, most vendors in the city expect the prices to skyrocket even further.The price rise is seasonal, said Balu, a vegetable vendor at Begumpet. Balu, who buys his vegetable stock from Gudimalkapur Rythu Bazaar, said:The present rise is not due to lorry strike. There were a lot of trucks supplying vegetables to the market on Monday. Farmers are not releasing stock and there is a shortage of supply in the market, said the vendor.The retail price of potatoes have shot up by `4 and are now being sold for `12 a kilogram. The price of ladies finger, carrots, beans, cauliflowers too have gone up.Sem beans have become unaffordable for us vendors. Two days ago the price was `35 a kg but now it is selling at `50 per kg. I decided not to stock the vegetable, said Ravindra Reddy, owner of Hindupriya Vegetable shop at Begumpet. The prices do keep changing every few weeks but a steep rise usually happens in the summer, he added.Interestingly, the rise in potato prices in Telangana comes at a time when the prices have gone down in West Bengal and other states due to bumper crop resulting in over supply.The Centre-owned National Horticultural Boards data for the second half of March also showed a 25 per cent decline in wholesale vegetable prices across many states. The reason for the falling prices has been attributed to farmers rushing to sell off their stock fearing spoilage of vegetables due to summer."
137,Rising veggie prices worry traders,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rising-veggie-prices-worry-traders/article17821230.ece,2017-04-05,The Hindu,"Even as the truckers have decided to continue their strike, traders at Koyambedu wholesale market are worried over the rising vegetable prices.Since Thursday, the truckers strike had affected the supply of some of the locally-grown vegetables and pushed up their prices. Wholesale traders noted that the market received only 220 truckloads of vegetables against its daily share of 300 lorries on Monday. This had led to short supply of vegetables such as carrot, brinjal, beans and beetroot.Lorries mainly from southern parts of the State refrained from transporting goods even though the Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners Federation had announced that essential goods supply would not be affected. Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

To avoid middlemen, farmers can sell their produce directly to such centres by showing Aadhaar cards or land sowing papers.Calling it a coincidence that thetook nine decisions on the festival of Ram Navami, cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh said that a proposal on illegal slaughterhouses was also discussed. He said 26 illegal slaughterhouses in the state had been closed till date.Announcing the decisions after a 90-minute meeting, Singh said loans of up to Rs 1 lakh taken by small and marginal farmers, with land holdings of less than five acres, until March 31, 2016, would be waived. The cabinet also decided to declare loans worth Rs 5,630 cr given by banks to the state's 7 lakh farmers as ""non-performing assets"", writing these off.Singh said, ""The total expenditure on these two heads would be Rs 36,359 crore, which would be raised through 'Kisan Rahat Bond' to keep the budget deficit within the limit of 3% of GDP.""A government release stated, ""Out of 2.30 crore farmers in the state, approximately 2.15 cr have land holdings between one and five acres. About 86.68 lakh of them are estimated to have taken crop loans from banks and they would be benefited.""Reiterating the government's position, Singh said no officer would be allowed to act ""over-zealously"" while enforcing the law, and anyone found doing so would be taken to task. The government isin letter and spirit, Singh said.Reacting to the Cabinet decisions, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav accused the Yogi government of cheating the farmers.""This is not what the BJP had promised. It had promised to write off farmer loans and never spoken about any limit,"" he tweeted minutes after the waiver was announced.Replying to Akhilesh, power minister Shrikant Sharma said the BJP government was working towards fulfilling its poll promises but the opposition is habituated to being critical.Sharma also said anti-Romeo squads were doing good work and have been praised by all. Officers have been directed not to harass couples or ask for their identity cards, else strict action would be taken against them, he said.Clarifying on crop loans, Sharma said any farmer who has taken loan for pesticides, wheat, paddy, fertilizer and seeds would benefit.An eight-member committee under chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar has been formed to prepare the crop loan waiver scheme.The panel, also comprising heads of various departments like finance, agriculture besides the co-ordinator of state-level bankers committee, would work out the modalities of the waiver scheme after examining all relevant aspects. The government would finalise the financing arrangements based on the recommendations of the committee.The government's decision to purchase wheat in first phase up to 40 lakh metric tonne with a target of purchasing up to 80 lakh metric tonne is significant, it plans to do so through 5,000 wheat purchase centres.""If needed, these numbers could be increased,"" Sharma said, adding that over and above the MSP of Rs 1,625 per quintal, the government has also decided to give an additional Rs 10 per quintal as transportation and loading charges to farmers.The government decided to form a committee headed by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya to study how potato farmers produce could be utilised so that they continue to grow it regularly. Other members of the panel include agriculture Surya Pratap Shahi and forest and horticulture minister Dara Singh Chauhan.Similarly, a committee headed by Deputy CM Dr Dinesh Sharma would visit other states to study their industrial policy before a new industrial policy is formulated in the state. Other members of the committee are Satish Mahana, Shrikant Sharma, Rajesh Agrawal and Nand Gopal 'Nandi'.A committee has been formed to study ways to check illegal mining. It would be headed by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya and would have Suresh Khanna and Dara Singh Chauhan as members. The committee would submit its report in a week time, Sharma said. The Cabinet thanked the Central government for giving statutory power to National Backward Commission."
139,"Rs 30,700cr loan waiver by Yogi",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170405/jsp/nation/story_144640.jsp,2017-04-05,Telegraph,"Lucknow, April 4: The Yogi Adityanath government today decided to waive harvest loans worth up to Rs 1 lakh of small and marginal farmers, three weeks after the SBI chief warned against disruption of credit discipline. An allocation of Rs 30,729 crore will be made by the state government for this purpose, said health minister Sidharth Nath Singh, announcing the decision. He told a news conference that Rs 5,630 crore worth of loans of seven lakh farmers in the state that had been categorised as NPA (non-performing assets) had also been waived. ""These loans had been taken from all banks,"" Singh said. Bankers are already grappling with bad loans worth over Rs 9.5 lakh crore on their books mainly because of loan defaults by several large corporate houses. The Uttar Pradesh government's decision, which fulfils an election promise of the BJP, has triggered fears of copycat demands from elsewhere in the country. In Maharashtra, the government is already under pressure to announce a complete farm loan waiver. Health minister Singh said there were 2.15 crore small and marginal farmers, out of a total of about 2.3 crore farmers in Uttar Pradesh. But sources said there were 86 lakh farmers with harvest loan dues of up to Rs 1 lakh. About 1.29 crore farmers would be disappointed by the first cabinet decision of the BJP government, the sources added. Former chief minister and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav tweeted that the state government had ditched poor farmers. ""The promise was to waive total loan, not up to a limit. Crores of farmers feel cheated because of the limit of Rs 1 lakh. The poor farmers have been betrayed,"" he wrote. But BJP chief Amit Shah tweeted: ""Congratulation to Yogi Adityanath and cabinet for historic decision of loan waiver of 2.15 crore small and marginal farmers...."" Singh said it was a coincidence that the first cabinet took nine decisions on the occasion of Ram Navami, celebrated today. The cabinet reaffirmed its March 19 decision of closing ""all illegal slaughterhouses"". ""So far we have closed only 26 illegal slaughterhouses. But it has been resolved that no illegal units would be allowed to continue. Those interested may renew their licence,"" the minister said. Buffalo and goat slaughterhouse owners had alleged that the government was forcing all of them to shut their units. Srikant Sharma, the power minister who jointly addressed the news conference with Singh, said the cabinet had also decided to continue with the anti-Romeo squad. ""It is doing a very good job. But some political parties are trying to malign it. Police officers have been warned that action will be taken against them if the squad demanded identity cards from couples sitting in parks and roaming anywhere else. The innocent would not be harassed and the guilty must not be spared,"" Sharma said. The cabinet also decided to buy 80 lakh MT of wheat at the minimum support price this year and formed a three-member committee under deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to study how potato growers could get better price for their produce. Maurya will head one more committee of three members to report within a week how to check illegal mining. A five-member panel under deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma will study how to attract industrial investment in the heartland state through a single-window system. The other cabinet decisions include a sports complex in Ghazipur and a proposal to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for forming and giving constitutional status to the National Commission for OBCs."
140,Australia banking watchdog warns of more curbs on housing,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/australia-banking-watchdog-warns-of-more-curbs-on-housing/articleshow/58020099.cms,2017-04-05,The Times Of India,"By Jamie Freed and Swati PandeySYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking watchdog said on Wednesday that authorities can and will take further action if needed to stop a debt-fuelled bubble in the country's red-hot housing market.Wayne Byres, chairman of the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA), said measures announced last week were aimed at promoting prudent lending and borrowing practices, and not to influence housing prices.Housing has become a political hot potato and have dominated newspaper headlines recently, with prices in Sydney skyrocketing almost 20 percent a year, having more than doubled since 2008. In Melbourne, they are racing at nearly 16 percent.The feverish pace of price increases prompted APRA to announce measures asking banks to limit new interest-only loans to 30 percent of total new mortgages, from 40 percent now. It also demanded that banks limit investor credit to ""comfortably remain below"" a previously set cap of 10 percent annual growth.""This latest step is a tactical response to current market conditions - we can and will do more, or less, as conditions evolve,"" he said at an industry conference in Sydney.""Our role in the current environment is to promote a higher-than-normal degree of prudence - definitely by lenders and, ideally, also borrowers - in both credit decisions and balance sheet strength.""Just this week, Australia's corporate watchdog joined the fray, introducing a new round of industry surveillance to ensure banks and brokers were not recommending overly expensive interest-only loans to customers.The measures come as regulators grow increasingly worried about a run-up in borrowing at a time when household debt is already at record highs, risking a damaging pullback in home prices.Australian banks are among the world's most profitable lenders with strong capital levels. They emerged out of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed and regulators want to ensure they remain safe.Banks have largely welcomed the recent measures.""I don't think any of us want to see house prices going backwards but more a leveling off of the trajectory would be a good thing,"" said Catriona Noble, Managing Director, Retail, ANZ. ""The 30 percent cap is good and... we can manage that.""""UNQUESTIONABLY STRONG""APRA was also looking at bolstering capital levels to ensure major banks are ""unquestionably strong"" to withstand a repeat of the global financial crisis. It had held off a decision on implementing new measures until an agreement was reached in Basel for global lenders. Although Basel has now extended its deadline APRA is pushing ahead.""It is important to remember that neither we nor the banking industry has stood still in the meantime,"" Byres said.""Without clarity as to a deadline for an agreement in Basel, we have decided it does not make sense to wait any longer to deal with the question of 'unquestionably strong'.""Byres expects APRA to announce new capital rules by mid-2017 and analysts say it is increasingly likely the watchdog will introduce tighter rules on assessing mortgage risk.""We believe a combination of macro prudential measures and higher risk weights could be viewed positively by APRA, the central bank and the government,"" said Richard Wiles, analyst at Morgan Stanley.""Higher capital requirements and slower investor property loan growth would enhance financial stability,"" Wiles said, while higher mortgage rates for property investors ""may remove the case for RBA rate hikes.""On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) held interest rates steady at a record low 1.50 percent for the eighth straight month.(Reporting by Jamie Freed; Writing by Swati Pandey; Editing by Richard Pullin & Shri Navaratnam)"

A shipment of potato seeds (which were to be distributed to farmers for sowing in the coming season) had arrived at Whitefield Railway Station from Punjab. The delicate seeds had to be taken to a cold storage facility close to Hoskote within a few hours, else they would become duds. We did not have the time to remove our seats to increase capacity of our buses. We rushed 20 buses within half hour, he said.Nearly 100 trips were done to and from Whitefield station, and the whole load  crammed into luggage spaces, on and under the seats  were transported.As the transporters strike intensifies, more associations have joined the strike against the hike in insurance premiums for goods vehicles.With the strike expected to continue longer, KSRTC has geared itself for all exigencies.We have instructed all our district offices to ensure buses to help farmers transport their agricultural produce. The last two seats of the bus can be removed if needed to increase the transport capacity. KSRTC will coordinate with Deputy Commissioners of the districts so that KSRTC buses can be called to transport health essentials or horticulture produce, said S.R.

There has been a nearly 40% dip in quantum of oranges coming from Nagpur or beans from Ranchi or even peas from Ooty. Some manage to bring it to the markets through trains or trucks that are not on strike. But as supply has been hit, prices have gone up, said Keshav S.H., manager, Marketing, Hopcoms.For instance, in three days, the price of Orange Nagpura has gone up to Rs. 57 from Rs. 45; while peas from Ooty has touched Rs. 100 per kg."

We should move to being lightly regulated and well governed, where the efficient and honest are encouraged and the inefficient and dishonest are penalised, he said, addressing the graduating students of the Indian School of Business.A well-known face of the Indian industry, Mr. Bajaj mentioned this while outlining what he believed politicians should do. There is no place for crony capitalism, he said.Attributing the relatively low per capita income to a misdirected socialist pattern of industrialisation, especially between 1970 and 1990, he said resources were wasted on the public sector while the private sector stymied. We developed a language of rights, not responsibilities, and created a huge burden of distortions and subsidies in the economy.Politicians should realise the damage done by the socialist clap trap and essentially dismantle the old system. If the private sector has progressed it is because it functions on the basis of merit.Public sector banksTracing other issues such as inefficiencies and corruption, labour laws, and collapse of public education and healthcare, Mr. Bajaj said, Public sector banks have been repeatedly looted by politicians and businessmen in collusion with banks officials. This, he explained, was done to create bad loans, whose cost is ultimately borne by the honest tax payer, leaving us with the hot potato of the twin balance sheet problem.The focus of politicians should be on efficient provision of services in health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure, besides a light but effective regulation of the private sector. Emphasising the need to minimise the role of black money and criminals in elections, Mr. Bajaj said public funding of elections and simultaneous elections at the Centre and the States were a necessary step in this regard.On their part, businessmen should first and foremost run their businesses well, growing in size, reach and capability. We must set and achieve the high standards of governance we expect from the government.Underscoring the significance of teamwork, he told the large gathering of students their families that leadership is about performance, consistent behaviour, and trust worthiness.Chairman of ISB Board Adi Godrej and dean Rajendra Srivastava urged the new graduates to focus on building a better society and be conscious of the need for utmost integrity and diligence. The graduation day marked the graduation of of the largest group of students  1,014  from the institute."

The approval is in tune with the state cabinet's decision to procure potatoes so that the farmers are not forced to sell it at throwaway prices in summer.The purchase will be made at Rs 4,870 per MT. The agriculture ministry will provide an additional Rs 1,217.50 per MT for overhead expenses such as transportation charges, mandi tax and godown charges. Purchase centres/areas will be decided by the state government in consultation with the state procurement agency.The move comes days after the UP government's decision to waive farm loan of small and marginal farmers and speed up wheat procurement drive at minimum support price (MSP) in the state.""The decision to procure potatoes is expected to provide a big relief to farmers who have, otherwise, to sell their produce at low price due to intervention of middlemen. Absence of cold chain in many parts of the state forces farmers to sell their produce within months of its harvest once temperature rises and this led them to get lower prices"", said an official.Announcing the decision, the agriculture ministry said, ""The MIS will be implemented by the state agency. The potatoes will be purchased from the cooperative societies, farmers' organisations or directly from the farmers to eliminate the possibility of middlemen taking advantage of the scheme. The state government will ensure that the produce is purchased from genuine farmers only"".It is decided that the procured stocks will be disposed of in the open market to ensure maximum realizable price. ""If necessary, this can also be sold to processing units within the state. The state agency would also make efforts to export the procured potatoes after processing"", said the ministry.""In order to avoid recycling, the stock would not be sold in the same market/state from where it has been procured during the period of the scheme. However, if the prices are better it can be sold locally"", said the official.The ministry made it clear that barter payments or payments in kind to farmers for procurement will not be allowed. It said, ""Payment to farmers as far as possible will be made through non-cash transaction and receipts for sales must be through banking channel only, preferably through demand draft""."

153,The ultimate price: Should what you pay for tomatoes matter?,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/the-ultimate-price-should-what-you-pay-for-tomatoes-matter-4611009/,2017-04-12,Indian Express,"Photo for representational purposes. Photo for representational purposes.This is the time of the year when as temperatures rise with the summers onset, so do prices of most vegetables. Its a phenomenon as predictable as the fall in prices that accompany lower temperatures during the winter months.A good example is tomatoes, which are currently retailing at around Rs 16 per kg, as against an average range of Rs 8.5-12 during November-January. In all likelihood, prices will firm up further over the next couple of months. Last year, they averaged almost Rs 45 in May, over Rs 56 in June and eased somewhat to Rs 30 in July, before collapsing to below Rs 10 per kg in August (see chart).These wild price oscillations have largely to do with natural, occasionally untoward, factors determining availability. Tomatoes are usually a 120-125 day crop, which start yielding fruits after 75 days, with production happening in flushes. There can be up to ten flushes in any given crop cycle, each following the previous one in four-five days intervals. Although tomatoes can be grown year-round, the water stress during summers means plantings mostly happen in June-July (with the monsoon rains), October-November and January-February. Arrivals pick up from mid-August onwards and peak over the winter.The above irregular supplies are further exacerbated by tomatoes being perishable and not amenable to storage, unlike potatoes or onions. The result is that prices fluctuate hugely during any year, with consumers having to especially pay much more in May-June-July, when crop availability is very poor.When prices of any vegetable go up, there is a natural outcry from consumers. But whats often not realised is that an average household consumes a basket of fruits and vegetables (F&V). While prices of individual items may go up, what matters ultimately for the household is how much it pays for the entire basket during any given month.Thus, even though tomato prices go up with dwindling supplies in the summer months, this does not hold true for other vegetables such as bhindi (okra), kheera (cucumber), lauki (bottle gourd), tinda (round gourd), tori (sponge gourd) and chichinda (snake gourd). You get all these cheaper in summers because of increased availability, which is also the case with mangoes (the King of Fruits), watermelons, sweet lime (mosambi), lychees, plums, peaches and cherries.In the same chart displaying the swing in retail tomato prices since January 2016, we also have the average per kg rate for the entire monthly F&V basket consumed by households. This price  based on the average value of F&V purchased by our consumers at Bigbasket.com  turns out to be relatively uniform and stable. Our consumers paid between Rs 43 and Rs 60 per kg for the average F&V item, which is quite different from shelling out anywhere from Rs 8.5 to Rs 56 for a kg of tomatoes.If overall price stability is what counts, we shouldnt worry much if individual items within the entire F&V basket cost more during certain months. Moreover, prices become an issue only when they go up. Spare a thought for the poor farmer, including the one growing tomatoes. Last August, prices crashed to levels where production costs could not be recovered. In November and December also, a bumper crop, coupled with the sudden demand shrinkage due to demonetisation, led to farmers destroying their standing crop in the field. But that did not bother us much.Price stability is eventually not just about consumers. Its also about farmers. Without a mechanism to ensure enough remuneration for the farmer to feed and take care of his familys essential needs, he will be in no position to produce to meet our consumption requirements. The farmer should be entitled to a reasonable annual income increment, just as we look forward to during this time of the time. A four-five per cent yearly increase in our average F&V spend shouldnt be too much for us to bear.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In another decision, the ogi cabinet also decided that Yogi cabinet also decided that the damaged transformers would have to be replaced within 48 hours, unlike the existing system of 72 hours , Sharma said and added that a roaster of 24-hour electricity in district headquarters, 20 hours in tehsil headquarters and 18 hours in rural areas have been okayed.The Yogi government also gave nod to making roads across the state pothole-free by June 15.

However, due to perishable nature of fruits and vegetables and more dependency on climatic factor, many times these crops face either glut or shortage thereby affecting farmers as well as consumers.""The glut situations are observed in many crops like tomato, onion , potato as well as garlic which lead to heavy fluctuations in area and production in subsequent years. The seminar will focus on various issues related to the topic and formulate policies and strategies to avoid the problems faced by the farmers,"" said an official from NHRDF.The prices of vegetables are decided on the demand and supply ratio. Onion prices go up if demand is more as compared to supply and the prices crash if supply is huge as compared to the demand.The average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 400 to Rs 500 in the past six months due to arrivals of onions in large quantity at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee markets. It costs Rs 1,000 for producing one quintal onion. Accordingly, farmers incur losses if the prices go below that. Hence, this workshop will help farmers understand the glut management for vegetables particularly onions.Divisional revenue commissioner Eknath Dawale will inaugurate the event."

In the last 15 days, prices of many vegetables have more than doubled barring that of potato and onion.In retail markets and shops in Satellite area, except potatoes and onions, no other vegetable is available at rates below Rs 50 per kg. While in Agriculture Produce Market Committee, (APMC), Ahmedabad, brinjal is selling somewhere between Rs8-Rs16 per kg in wholesale, the same is selling in retail at Rs 60 per kg in city localities.The prices of vegetables at APMC have gone up by around 15%, while in retail the prices have almost doubled. Officials from APMC said that all vegetables, except potatoes and onions, are in short supply.According to Gujarat agriculture department, the sowing of vegetables, which was normally done across 1.24 lakh hectares was done only across 82,000 hectares. The department however claims that the sowing of vegetable was around 9,000 hectares more than that in last year.Prices of several vegetables had crossed the Rs 100 mark in retail market in 2016, but had eased after demonetization.Agriculture minister, Chiman Sapariya, however, said, ""The shortfall in sowing has no relation with demonetization. The sowing was delayed because there was less rainfall in 2016, and hence farmers moved away from vegetable to crops that needed less water.""""We hope that prices will likely come down within the next fortnight when the summer crop starts to arrive. The prices are generally on the higher side during this period,"" said D M Patel, secretary, APMC, Ahmedabad.Patel said, ""During demonetization, bulk buyers were away from the market. As a result, farmers were forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices. But now the market has stabilized.""APMC officials said that supply of potato to the APMC each day was 370 kg more than what is normal at this time of the year, and the supply of onion is 415 kg more than expected, daily."

The waiver will cost the state exchequer around Rs 3,500 crore.The farmers having outstanding power bills of Rs 10,000 or more will be allowed to pay the same in four installments, the cabinet decided.It also decided to ensure that transformers were changed in 48-hours, instead of 72 hours, in rural areas and within 24 hours in the urban areas.The farmers will not be required to transport the malfunctioning transformers to the power station. This would be responsibility of the power corporation officials, Sharma said.A memorandum of understanding (MoU) will be signed under the union governments power for all project in the presence of Yogi Adityanath and union power minister Piyush Goyal in Lucknow on April 14, the minister said.The pact will be inked to meet the Centres target of making the state energy efficient by 2018.Relief for potato farmersThe cabinet decided to purchase 1 lakh metric tonnes of potato at Rs 487 per quintal to protect the interest of potato farmers.The government wants to give adequate price to potato growers. Even if we cannot give them profit, we will ensure they do not incur loss, Sharma said.He said district magistrates were asked to set up procurement centres wherever needed.If the previous SP regime had played a proactive role, the condition of potato growers would have been better, he added.Sugarcane dues to be paid in 14 daysThe government also made it mandatory to clear the current dues of the sugarcane growers within 14 days and previous dues within 120 days.Legal action will be initiated against sugar mills if they fail to make payments, Sharma said.Steps to end shortage of building materialsThe state cabinet also decided to amend the Uttar Pradesh Minor Minerals Rules, 1963, in a bid to end the shortage of sand and coarse sand, which is adversely impacting construction activities.Health minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state cabinet had constituted a committee, headed by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, at its last meeting to look into the issue.The committee had submitted its report, he said.The state government will allow transportation of minor minerals with valid transit permits from other states.As a short term measure, district magistrates will issue e-tenders to allocate up to 10-acre area for sand mining for six months. He said short term measures had been initiated as implementation of long-term measures may take six to eight months."

It comprises mostly Dalit families who are into agriculture. The recent works taken up by Tangedco has led to a fear among the residents that the construction will begin soon and force them out of their homes and farms.P. Rani, a resident of the village, said they had not been informed whether the village lay in an area that would be flooded after the dam was built. She also said that many of the residents had small farms in the area where the dam would come up. Tangedco should let us know of their construction plans. We have no idea if we need to start looking for new houses and whether we will be compensated in case we are expected to move, she said.K Nagarajan, a farmer cultivating carrot, beetroot, potatoes and beans on a seven-acre plot that is expected to get flooded, said the locals wanted compensation at the rates outlined by the recent Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, and demanded that a committee to estimate the current market value of the land be set up in consultation with the locals.We don't have a problem with the dam coming up as it could potentially help thousands of people. But there should be more of a dialogue between us and Tangedco, he said.Compensation packageWhen contacted, Tangedco officials in the Nilgiris said the construction of the dam was being undertaken by the projects wing of the organisation, from its headquarters in Chennai. The officials said that resettlement and compensation packages would be handled by the office in Chennai, and that the Nilgiris division of Tangedco would only take over the dam's operation after its completion."

However, most of the agreements signed during the previous two editions of the Progressive Punjab investors' summit are yet to see the light of the day.The previous SAD-BJP alliance had organized the first investor summit in 2013 and claimed to have signed agreements worth Rs 67,000 crore. The second edition of the event in 2015, focused on attracting investments in manufacturing, IT agro-processing , healthcare and bio-sciences, and garnered promises of Rs 1.13 lakh crore investment.According to Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion, a total of 519 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were inked at the two summits of the previous regime. Of these only 22% have materialized so far, several agreements remain only on paper. The first summit witnessed 128 MoUs and of these 62, around 48%, have actually materialized so far. Similarly, at the summit held two years back, of 391 MoUs were inked. Of these, barely 53 or 13%, translated into investment.There was lot of euphoria over the initial interest shown by the big companies to invest in the state. An official of the bureau said that some agreements were in the process of being converted into investment and the final figures would go up. These include 17 projects from the 2013 summit and 64 from the 2015 summit, he said, citing ADLABS amusement park worth Rs 1,200 crore, and Rs 1,400 crore integrated food manufacturing unit as examples.Some of the key projects that have construction work completed include ITC's Rs 680 crore food-cum-logistics center at Kapurthala and Mahindra & Mahindra's Rs 18 crore seed potato project in Mohali. However, there are certain projects that have been put on hold due to various policy issues, including a Rs 50 crore frozen meat project in Mohali, and Rs 80 crore food processing project in Ludhiana.A private university with investment of Rs 350 crore, super speciality hospital for Rs 900 crore, medical university and hospital with estimated cost Rs 1,200 crore, are also in the pipeline listed under the ""Active Conversion Projects"" even though the MoUs were signed after the 2013 summit.The previous government had offered a slew of incentives including cheap power to new investors at Rs 4.90 per unit for five years, VAT retention, exemption from stamp duty, and electricity duty as per the 2013 industrial policy."

165,Wholesale inflation decelerates to 5.7%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/wholesale-inflation-decelerates-to-57/article18089491.ece,2017-04-18,The Hindu,"A decline in the prices of fuel and manufactured products helped inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), to moderate to 5.7% (provisional) for March 2017 despite hardening of food prices, data released by the government on Monday showed.The WPI inflation had touched a 39-month high of 6.55% (provisional) in February while it was -0.45% in March 2016.Compared to last month (February), WPI Inflation declined by 85 basis points (bps) to 5.70% in March17 due to sharp decrease in prices of items like potato (-17.07%), onion (-10.78%), non-food articles (4.91%), oil seeds (-0.9%), said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic advisor, Economic Research Department, SBI.Earlier, the largest decline in month-on-month inflation was in August 15, Mr. Ghosh added. The decline was accentuated by decline in fuel and power inflation and manufactured products.... Fuel prices were significantly cut on March 31 while rupee has been on an appreciating trend since February 2017.These two factors have pushed down fuel and manufactured product prices, he said.Primary food inflation trended higher as vegetable inflation emerged after six months of deflation although food price pressures are not yet a concern, as prices of cereals, pulses and spices have fallen sequentially in the last two to three months, said an analysis by Nomura.Fuel price inflation moderated on favourable base effects and a fall in most market-linked fuels. Furthermore, manufactured inflation moderated sharply to 3% in March from 3.7% in February as prices for manufactured food, non-metallic minerals and machine tools declined sequentially while other categories experienced muted increases, it said.Food inflation has increased a bit and this would require greater monitoring in light of the evolving weather conditions, said Pankaj Patel, president of the industry body FICCI.The government is keeping a close tab on the progress made on irrigation projects, cold chain projects etc. and improvement in these areas is likely to yield positive results.The focus on drip irrigation and micro-irrigation along with improvement in the efficiency of cropping patterns and water use mechanisms will strengthen agri-production and productivity, he said. Commodity prices  crude as well as metal prices  had been edging up putting pressure on wholesale prices over the past few months. However, the WPI based inflation announced today shows a decline from the previous month and this can be attributed to softening of inflation in fuel and power and manufactured goods segments. Further, the recent strengthening of rupee vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar will also contribute towards limiting imported inflation, he said.Output pricesThe analysis done by Nomura research analysts Sonal Varma and Neha Saraf said: Despite the surge in input cost inflation since January, firms have been reluctant to raise output prices, likely reflecting uncertainty over the demand outlook after demonetisation.As demand recovers, we expect firms to start passing on past input cost increases to consumers and the sharp drop in perishable food inflation to reverse. Yet, we believe February marked the peak in year-on-year WPI inflation and it should gradually taper off over 2017 on base effects, they added.Considering the higher-than-expected WPI inflation in Q1, we are raising our 2017 forecast to 4.7% (from 4%) they said."

Prices are generally lower in western UP than in eastern parts of the state.In 2016-17, the state produced a record 155-160 lakh metric tonnes of potato. Adityanath has also reached out to the Narendra Modi government for help, asking Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh to impress upon other states to procure potato from UP and immediately call a meeting of state agriculture ministers in this regard. The UP chief minister also wants potato crop from the state to get prominence for procurement in the Centre's e-National Agricultural Mart.This comes after a top-level committee set up by Adityanath last week submitted a report. As per the report, potato prices in 19 key markets of UP as on April 10 vary widely between Rs 290 per quintal in Farukkhabad and Rs 690 in Lucknow.In nine mandis including seven in western UP in Agra, Saharanpur, Moradabad and Meerut, the wholesale price is less than Rs 400 while it is above Rs 500 in six other mandis including ones in eastern UP in Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Gonda.""If an arrangement is made to transport potato produce from low-price mandis to the highprice ones, then farmers can get a proper price. District collectors of these districts should coordinate, publicise the mandi prices in newspapers daily and inspire farmers to shift their produce from the low-price offering mandis to the high-price ones,"" the UP government said in an order issued on April 18."

He has done a wide-ranging research on potato and the diseases affecting it.He said Uttar Pradesh was the biggest producer of potatoes in the country amounting, to 29-35% of the total national production.Ground reports said 2016-17 saw potato cultivation in an area of 6.14 lakh hectare across the state with an expected production of 155 to 160 lakh metric ton.With the BJP having made huge promises to farmers during assembly polls, handling of the potato harvest will be the first true test of the Yogi government, especially in light of UP being the largest producer of potatoes in the country where lakhs of farmers cultivate this cash crop. Last year, thousands of potato farmers were forced to dump their crop, leaving it to rot owing to very poor price being offered for their produce in the market.To ensure that all promises are kept, the state government, based on recommendations of an expert committee, has come up with a market intervention strategy to handle the potato harvest in the state.Based on it, the principal secretary (horticulture) Sudhir Garg has shared that a scrutiny of the 19 bulk markets or mandis of the state has shown that on April 10, 2017, the bulk price of potatoes varied between Rs 290 and Rs 690 per quintal.Garg has communicated this information through a government order sent to director (horticulture and food processing department).Potato sold at Rs 290 per quintal, the lowest in the state, in Farrukhabad and at Rs 680 per quintal, the highest, in Lucknow.Further scrutiny of the markets has shown that in districts like Agra, Aligarh, Bareilly, Moradabad, Allahabad, Kanpur, Farrukhabad, Meerut and Saharanpur the bulk price of potato was Rs 400 or less per quintal on April 3, 2017. Its price was Rs 500 or above in districts like Gonda, Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Mirzapur and Varanasi.The order says that the government believes that timely and adequate supply of potato from low-priced markets to high priced ones can help achieve a balance in pricing that benefits both farmers and consumers.The government wants the district magistrates and the district horticulture officers to not just get the potato prices printed in local dailies but also through coordination with their counterparts of other districts facilitate flow of potato from low priced districts to markets in high- priced ones.The state government also plans to send potato to other states with support of their agriculture ministers via respective distribution agencies and marketing federations and tapping the e-NAM or e-national agriculture market.Welcome step but support price too low: ExpertExperts believe that extending support price for potato, which is the most important cash crop of UP, is a welcome step. However, they say the support price of Rs 487 per quintal is too low, especially as a bulk of the potato farmers are small scale cultivators.Out of the states total production, around 75 lakh metric ton is consumed by the people and around 7 lakh metric ton is used for processed food. Another 20 lakh metric ton is used as seed. The surplus is exported to other states and even abroad, including Nepal, said prof Pradeep Bhargava, a noted development economist.Uttar Pradesh has 1708 private and government cold storages at present with storage capacity of 130.26 lakh metric ton, amounting to 81% of the expected produce.The state government has said that till March 31, 2017, 96.49 lakh metric ton of potatoes, 74% of the storage capacity, had already been achieved.When there is a bumper harvest, the governments move will enable farmers to get at least the minimum support price. This is a welcome step. However, the support price should have been much higher so as to ensure a decent minimum earning for small-scale farmers who farm on 1 to 5 bigha land so that it justifies their investments and helps make enough money to promote farming and also support their livelihood, he added.Prof Bhargava says that on the face of it, the fact that cost of production on average is Rs 28,000 per hectare and the return is Rs 84,000 per hectare seems impressive. However, when the farmer is small scale and sells potato at a price of Rs 4.87 per kilogram earning hardly Rs 8,400 per bigha, he ends up with hardly enough to justify his investments and labour of three-four months. A better support price therefore is needed, he added."

170,Is hypothyroidism killing your metabolism?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/back2basics/is-hypothyroidism-killing-your-metabolism/,2017-04-25,The Times Of India,"The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in our metabolism. The thyroid gland located at the Adams Apple near your throat, is what produces hormones that activate cell activity by controlling your bodys temperature and the rate that your body burns calories.Our brain produces TSH (magnesium, B-12, zinc and protein are required to produce this) which travels to your thyroid gland and tells your thyroid gland to produce T4. (To produce that we need iodine Vitamin B5 and Vitamin C). Through the blood stream carries T4 and when it gets to the tissues it is converted into T3 (Selenium and glutathione is required for this conversion) which is the active form of thyroid hormone which gets inside of your cells nucleus to do all the work. The little tiny key hole on the surface of the cell is called the nuclear receptor where the thyroid hormone binds with the (This binding requires Vitamin A ad Vitamin D) which is what increases your metabolism.Hypothyroidism means too less of T4 and T3 being produced which will cause people to experience energy loss, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, elevated cholesterol, constipation. So what are the foods that we can use to combat this situation in other words to facilitate the production of T4 and T3. Listed below are the best foods rich in the nutrients according to each particular task.The required intake of magnesium, B-12, zinc and protein can be got from;Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, curds, cheese etc Eggs Meat Pulses and Legumes Nuts and seedsThe required intake of Iodine can be got from;Wheatgrass Spirulina Seafood SaltThe required intake of Vitamin B5 and Vitamin C can be got from;Oats Tomatoes Potatoes Citrus fruits BroccoliThe required intake of Selenium and glutathione can be got from;Brazil nuts Milk FishThe required intake of Vitamin A and Vitamin D can be got from;Eggs Mushrooms FishMost of these are regular foods that we can easily incorporate into our daily diet. Including these foods might be the key to stabilizing the thyroid affecting your metabolism.Claims of goiterogenic vegetables of the Brassica family such as Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and even greens such as spinach and kale, affecting the thyroid negatively are only based on conclusions that the goiterogens will block the absorption of iodine which is one of the key agents of optimum thyroid function. However one will have to eat them raw and in too large and amount for that to happen. Meanwhile if we give up on eating these veggies, we might be barring ourselves from getting lots more nutritional benefits. So, unless there is a specified clinical observation from your doctor dont disbar yourself from these veggies having high nutritional content.To re-activate your metabolism, you need to energize yourself with correct food intake and proper exercise. Smaller meals with consistent balance of carbs and protein, will help you reboot during the day. Divide your activity evenly during the day, so it keeps your food to energy conversion and carbs utility in a cycle. Remember that the key here is consistency, once the body gets used to the cycle, you will see a difference in your health too. Heal naturally."

A call on her mobile interrupts her concentration, and she answers with one word: ""Tomorrow"".""That was an order for 20 cookstoves to deliver in Murang'a County,"" she explained. Making and delivering cookstoves in this central Kenyan region has been Njau's job for the past year.Unusually long drought has caused fields and soil to dry up around Nyeri, forcing men to take on seasonal work as road or construction builders. The burden of maintaining the household with few resources falls on women like Njau, who must look for other sources of income than farming.A growing number of them are setting up clean energy businesses, such as selling cookstoves that burn less firewood than traditional stoves, as an alternative livelihood.The new businesses not only give women a more resilient income in the face of climate change but help protect forests, which in turn regulate rainfall and help stave off drought.""Demand for cook stoves in rural households is fast increasing as deforestation leaves little firewood available for cooking,"" said Njau.Faced with poor crop yields due to irregular rainfall, she decided to sell her stock of maize and potatoes last year to market traders to raise 30,000 Kenyan shillings (about $300).She then used that as capital to buy the equipment needed - a shed and cookstove materials - to start her own business.She regularly receives orders for 10,000 shillings ($100) worth of stoves a week, with the price of one stove ranging from 170 to 200 shillings (approximately $2).""It used to take me three months to make that amount by growing and selling vegetables,"" she said. ""The money now allows me to feed my family and pay for my two children to go to school.""Njau does not regret making the switch from farming.""Last year there was very little to harvest because of the lack of rain,"" she said, gazing at drying shrubs on her farm. ""It looks like it will be the same this year for farmers.""TRAINING ENTREPRENEURSIn the offices of an ""Imarisha"" - a community-based organisation whose name in English means ""to make better"" - in nearby Misha village, trainer Winnie Muthoni shows Njeri Kiraithe how to mix charcoal dust, flour and sawdust in a plastic container to make charcoal briquettes.Muthoni then empties the container into a green compressing machine that turns out black briquettes, which can be burned for energy.Kiraithe is one of hundreds of women who have been trained since 2014 to start their own clean energy business.The initiative is part of the Women in Energy Enterprise in Kenya (WEEK) project, funded by development charity Practical Action, which encourages women in several Kenyan regions to become energy entrepreneurs.In Nyeri County alone, over 120 women run clean energy enterprises, explained James Mwangi Maina, a technology mentor at the Sustainable Community Development Services initiative, which also works on the WEEK project.Kiraithe, who said she enlisted for the free training because she couldn't make enough money from farming, intends to sell her stock of potatoes to raise about 20,000 shillings ($200) to start a charcoal briquette business.""The training has taught me that charcoal briquettes are in high demand in central Kenya's highlands,"" she said.""For instance, chicken farmers prefer to use briquettes to keep their roosts warm at night because the smoke they emit does not make you choke like firewood does.""""Briquettes also protect the environment because they are made of waste,"" she added.Muthoni, a former farmer herself, said that making charcoal briquettes has faster and higher returns than farming.""A 50 kg bag fetches about 100 shillings (about $10), and one person can sell up to 20 bags in a day to traders and farmers,"" she said.Maina agrees, saying that ""clean energy businesses have better returns because the women can potentially make money every day - provided there are orders - whereas farming is a one-off season"".SCALING UPMaina estimates that the WEEK project can create over 450 jobs across Kenya by the end of the year, adding that it plans to also recruit men as trainees to tackle youth employment.Njau's husband Philip gave up his construction job to help her manage and grow their cookstove business.""Men should also be involved in this type of business because the good returns create harmony at home,"" he said.Other trainees hope to become trainers themselves.""When my business flourishes, I plan to train and employ other women too so that they can be self-reliant,"" Njeri said.

173,"Hit by drought, Tamil Nadu farmers turn to technology for saving crops",http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2017/apr/29/hit-by-drought-tamil-nadu-farmers-turn-to-technology-for-saving-crops-1598979.html,2017-04-29,The New Indian Express,"TIRUCHY: Pushed to the brink by the unprecedented drought brought about by monsoon failure and the neighbouring States refusal to release Cauvery water, farmers in Tiruchy are increasingly turning to technology as panacea for their predicament.Of late, farmers have been making a beeline to the Agriculture department seeking subsidy for micro irrigation systems. Official data shows three-fold increase in the number of farmers employing micro-irrigation techniques in just a year, underscoring the need for judicious use of available water through alternative systems.In 2015-16, only 300-350 farmers applied for subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) for micro-irrigation systems. A year on, the number rose sharply to 1,257 in 2016-17. Officials from the Agriculture department link the spurt to the drought that has gripped the State.According to the Tamil Nadu Horticulture Development Agency (TANHODA), subsidy is given for growing horticulture crops like vegetables including potato and onion, and non-horticulture crops such as cereals and pulses, based on the area of cultivation.The cost of devices ranges between Rs 31,000 to a few lakhs depending upon the acreage. Those having up to 5 acres are classified as Small and Marginal farmers and provided full subsidy for installing micro-irrigation systems such as drip or sprinkler units. Large-scale farmers are also included in this scheme, and given 75 per cent subsidy, R Mohankumar, Assistant Director of Agriculture told Express.Selected farmers will be offered a choice of 34 government approved companies to choose their equipment from.Officials, however, point out that a majority of farmers employ micro irrigation techniques, despite the subsidy, only as the last resort.February and March saw maximum enrollment of farmers for subsidy. Drip and sprinkler irrigation systems are thought of only during drought and as a last recourse, an official said.The success stories of farmers who reaped benefits of employing micro irrigation techniques are inspiring scores to adopt the same. Such was the reception that farmers who installed the drip and sprinkler system to irrigate horticulture crops are now extending its usage to non-horticulture crops by making minor modifications, officials added.Speaking to Express, M Peter James, a black gram farmer from Manickapuram village near Manachanallur, said, Prior to installing a sprinkler unit in my 4.5 acres of black gram and ladys finger fields, I had to operate the borewell for nearly 4 hours a day per wetting. With sprinklers in place, the running time of borewells has come down to 1 hour per wetting. Drip irrigation for paddyTiruchy-based Anbil Dharmalingam Agriculture College and Research Institute, in September 2016, cultivated multiple varieties of paddy using drip irrigation on experimental basis at Manikandam where the soil is alkali (less permeable, saline) and ground water saline. It turned out to be a success and harvest was done in January 2017. Paddy varieties such as ADT36 and TRY2 were found to viable for drip irrigation.Maintenance of the system is also very important. Agriculture department officials urge farmers to carry out routine maintenance.In the case of saline water, accumulation of salty substance in drip nozzles have to be regularly cleaned for better results, they say."
174,Simply finger-licking,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/simply-finger-licking/article18287898.ece,2017-04-29,The Hindu,"The memory works in mysterious ways. One day, just a few days ago, one part of my memory suddenly went blink-blink, emitting a warm and happy light. I dont know what triggered it, but a picture popped up in my mind of a small, nondescript shop in Old Delhi. And I recalled that it sold the most delicious bedmi sabzi.Theres an old Chinese saying which states that when memory calls, you must respond. So I responded and rushed off to Purani Dilli one sunny day. I took the Metro, got off at Chawri Bazaar, and then started walking towards Bazaar Sitaram, for, as I recalled, the bedmi shop was there.I found it to my left after walking down the lane for a while. It is still small and nondescript and, as I discovered in the next 10 minutes, it still sells the most delicious bedmi sabzi.The name of the shop is Ram Swarup Halwai. The address is 3294, Bazaar Sitaram, near Lal Darwaza. The phone numbers are 9210040054 and 9310804526. It is not a very well-known shop, but the local people know all about it. And, as I saw, quite a few people stop there for a morning meal.The shop, run by brothers Ajit Kumar and Anil Kumar, was set up 80 years ago by their grandfather. There is a small counter which holds a few different kinds of sweets  chamcham, gulab jamun, rasgulla and barfi.But the shop is really known for its bedmi sabzi and nagori halwa. In a kadhai on the side, you can see bedmis being fried. There is a runny and reddish potato sabzi in a large utensil. In a paraat on the counter you will find small nagoris, and in a huge paraat next to it, theres halwa.Let me tell you whats so special about Ram Swarup Halwais fare. One, the food is excellent. The bedmis are small but crisp, and the potato curry is spicy and mildly tart. The brothers carefully put a slit green chilli in the potato sabzi, so that makes it nicely hot. The small nagoris, again, are delightfully crisp. You pierce it with your thumb, stuff it with a good helping of halwa and pop it into your mouth. Life really looks up after that.The nagori is prepared with maida, or flour, mixed with suji, or semolina, which adds to its crispness. The halwa is excellent, and I thought the suji had been really well roasted  which to my mind is the test of a good halwa.I have always believed that nagori halwa is one of the best breakfast meals you can ever have. You can also dunk your nagori in some sabzi and eat it, if you like to alternate between sweet and savoury tastes.The second important point is that prices havent really gone up much at Ram Swarup Halwais little shop. A plate of two bedmis with potato sabzi comes for Rs. 15, while two pieces of nagori with halwa are for Rs. 10. The rate in the bigger shops in Old Delhi is five or six time higher. Of course, the better known bedmi sellers enhance their bedmis with side dishes, such as chholey, fenugreek chutney and pickled vegetables. Ram Swarups fare is simple  but finger licking good.I ate some bedmis and nagori halwa, packed some to be consumed later and made my way home. I gave my memory cells a little pat on their backs and urged them to carry on with the good work. The next time they go blink-blink, I am sure there will be another happy memory to be revisited."

They urged the authorities to begin works on an elephant corridor.Farmers, under the banner of Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene, staged a protest in Hassan on Tuesday seeking initiation of works related to the elephant corridor and also demanding suitable compensation as they have suffered losses due to jumbo menace.Farmers took out a protest march from Hemavathy statue to N R Circle and walked to the deputy commissioners office. Placing rotti and chutney on their heads, they walked to the DCs office and raised slogans against the centre and state for failing to address the farmers issues. They later submitted a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner V Chaitra.The protesters claimed that commercial crops of Malnad region, including coffee, pepper, banana and paddy are being destroyed by elephants which stray into the villages on the fringes of the forests in search of food and water. Yasalur, Hosuru, Changadihalli, Huchchangi, Igooru, Hethuru are a few villages in Sakleshpur taluk which have been worst affected, they said.The farmers demanded a permanent solution for the elephant menace, compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the kin of the deceased and suitable compensation for crop loss.They also sought good quality seed potatoes at subsidised prices and total waiver of farm loans.Compensation soughtThe farmers complained that despite submitting necessary documents for crop loss, the authorities and elected representatives had not taken any measures in disbursing compensation. Even after the Supreme Courts directive of total waiver of farm loans, centre and the state governments have been neglecting farmers, they said.They said that the fodder being distributed was of substandard quality. While the fodder banks at many places have been closed due to lack of maintenance, the banks at Channarayapatna, Arkalgud taluks have been collecting money for free fodder, they complained."

The construction of the Super Expressway will make the farmers lose their irrigated land in the area. Hearing the farmers grievance, MSRDC MD R Mopalwar promised to look at other alternatives to save their land.Our discussion with them has yielded a positive response. We have suggested them an alternative alignment that will go over mountains and forest land. This will not only save our land but will also save them a lot of money. With our homes and wells, the cost of our land will be much higher. There will be no loss of tree cover as there arent many trees there; it is mainly exposed rock. We are not against the construction of the highway, but we will not let them take away our irrigated land, said Kokate. The alternative alignment suggested by the farmers goes very close to the Kalsubai Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary and thus declared unfeasible by MSRDC.If we are to change our route, we will be entering the buffer zone of the sanctuary and we will not get the permissions for that. Today, we are outside Kalsubai by exactly 100 metres. We instead suggested that we will make an elevated road on that stretch. This will reduce our footprints to the least possible and we will require only half the land. They have 60 wells in these lands and elevated road will protect the wells also. We will continue our discussions with them and examine what best we can do for them, said Mopalwar.Of the 21,000 hectares required to build the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, 399 hectares is forest land, 17,499 hectares is agricultural land and 2,922 hectares is unused land. In the 710-km stretch around eight kilometres will pass through irrigated land. The Sinnar-Igatpuri farmers will together be losing around 46 hectares of land together. On this land, farmers grow grapes, pomegranates and vegetables like onion and potatoes among other crops. Their lives and family depend on this land.The construction of this highway has wreaked havoc in our lives. We constantly live in the fear of losing our land and our familys peace is lost. It is a mental torture. Farmers have begun carrying poison in their pockets now, says Shantaram Dhokne, a grape farmer from the area. Like other farmers, they too complain of pressure from officials to surrender their land. The measurement surveys are conducted with intense police presence and on our slightest protest we are lathicharged.

177,Opposition rejects govt's potato logic,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170504/jsp/odisha/story_149593.jsp,2017-05-04,Telegraph,"File picture of potato harvest Bhubaneswar, May 3: The state government has argued that the demand for potatoes in the state has soared following an increase in consumption especially in urban areas, where people prefer snacks and fast food made from the vegetable. However, the Opposition has rejected the argument and accused the government of coming up with absurd theories to hide its failure to meet the requirements of the people and justify the shortage. BJP vice-president Pratap Sarangi said: ""It exposes the lack of sincerity of the state government. How many urban centres are there in Odisha? Mostly the people in rural areas depend on the potatoes, which is an essential vegetable for them. It is never interested to boost potato production and its marketing in the state."" Director horticulture Srikanta Prusty in a letter to the state government cited that the demand for potato has gone up due to change in food habits. ""Due to gradual change in food habit the demand for potato consumption is increasing especially in urban areas for snacks and fast food where potatoes play a significant role in way of value addition in the processing sector,"" said Prusty. Prusty said the state requires 12 lakh MT potatoes per annum to meet its need. ""As it is unable to produce the required potatoes, most of the state's shortfall is met by neighbouring states such as Bengal,"" he said. In 2016-17, potato was cultivated over an area of 25,218 hectares and the production was 3 lakh MT. ""At present, the state produces around 20-25 per cent of its requirement,"" he said. He said the potato mission was a success in the state. Before starting the potato mission, he said, there were 27 functional cold storages in the state with a storage capacity of 1.37 lakh MT. After completion of the mission, the number of cold storages has increased to 35 with a storage capacity of 1.68 lakh MT of potatoes. On the price regulation of potatoes, he said: ""The wholesale market price of potatoes depends on the all-India mandi prices and the real market price is fixed accordingly."" At present, the potato is currently being sold at Rs 12 per kg."

Other GMO crops include apples that resist browning and potatoes that bruise less.Proponents of biotech crops say the technology lowers the cost of food and helps farmers more safely manage pests and diseases. But there has been increasing pressure from some consumers and environmental groups who argue that GMO crops increase pesticide use and pose threats to the environment and human health.GMO seedings expanded 3 percent in the United States, the largest producer of biotech crops, and 11 percent in Brazil, the No. 2 market, ISAAA said. The two countries represented 66 percent of total GMO crop seedings globally.Plantings declined by 3 percent in Argentina, largely due to reduced soybean seedings as farmers shifted land to corn and sunflower cultivation, the group said.Low cotton prices and high stocks triggered a 24 percent drop in biotech seedings in China, where some biotech corn and soybean varieties are approved for import but not for cultivation.(Reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

Whats more, the Agriculture Department will bear half the cost as subsidy, making the compost available at throwaway prices.Though the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) set up six waste processing plants two years ago, it has failed to market the compost generated there. Today, the plants have a stock of more than 30,000 tonnes of compost of various grades. Officials said this is taking up all the available space and has rendered the plants non-operational, leaving the BBMP with no choice but to launch a special drive to sell the compost.The civic body has already delivered 1,542 tonnes of fine compost (less than 4 mm) to farmers in Chickballapur, Tumakuru and Kanakapura in the past week. While it has set the price at Rs. 1,600 a tonne, farmers need to pay only Rs. 800 as the Agriculture Department will bear the remaining amount. Taking the transportation cost into account, farmers get the compost at an effective price of Rs. 300 a tonne, said N. Manjunath Prasad, Commissioner of BBMP.C.N. Chandru, a farmer from Chickballapur who grows capsicum and potato on 20 acres, has bought 60 tonnes of compost. Delivering it to the farm is a good initiative. The quality is very good, he said.B.Y. Srinivas, director of the Department of Agriculture, said the response has been overwhelming; in the open market, a tonne of compost would cost more than Rs. 3,000 a tonne.Different sizesApart from the fine-grade compost, the BBMP has over 12,000 tonnes of compost of medium lumps (16-35 mm) and over 10,000 tonnes of larger lumps (above 35 mm). Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda recently visited some of the plants and cleared sale of the remaining compost, said officials. However, they are yet to work out the modalities.Leading organic farmer L. Narayana Reddy said even the compost lumps can be used for agriculture as they act as good manure. Lumps have to be broken into finer particles before use, as they will not disintegrate easily in the soil. It would be better if the civic body breaks the lumps before offering them to farmers, he said. He also said farmers need to be educated on avoiding excess usage. I would recommend that farmers not use more than three tonnes for an acre, he said."
180,The man who launched a thousand Darshinis,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/the-man-who-launched-a-thousand-darshinis/articleshow/58557709.cms,2017-05-07,The Times Of India,"Coffee or kokum sherbet? Rava or ragi dosa? Even as newbies wonder what to order at Upahara Darshini (UD) in Jayanagar, Manasa Harish buys tokens for her staple - masala dosa, picks up her plate and settles with it and a glass of water at the small stainless steel table. She sniffs at the ragi dosa eater who is picking at her food and quickly finishes her crisp dosa filled with a mildly spiced potato masala. ""Every time I come to the maternity hospital nearby for consultation, I eat masala dosa here,"" smiles Harish.Eating at a Darshini is an exercise in minimalism. There is no time or lengthy menu to plot the next culinary adventure. Once you give the order, you should be prepared to hop from one counter to the other in quick succession, and eat your food standing while sharing the table with office-goers, offduty security guards and moms with cranky school children in tow.So it is better to stick to tried and tested food as the kitchen at UD churns out dosas and thatte idlis in full view of its diners.This is how Prabhakar R envisioned the ideal Indian fast food restaurant when he started the first Darshini in 1983 where now UD stands. ""Darshini means to see and select food (from a menu) as in a KFC or McDonald's,"" says Prabhakar. In this case, one gets to order south Indian staples at pocketfriendly prices just like he saw during a trip abroad. ""Simple and fast. That's what we needed to beat MNC restaurants and high food prices,"" says Prabhakar, sitting at his Banashankari residence.Today, three decades later, Baba Ramdev wants to start a chain of Indian QSRs or quick service restaurants to gain nationalist mileage and profits while beating 'foreign competition'. Prabhakar, who calls himself a consumer activist and a consult ant, says the more the merrier.""Maybe, Ramdev will be able to do it na tionally,"" he says.Prabhakar is underplaying the impact his Darshinis have had on the eating-out culture. The city has hundreds of Darshinis, most of them mentored for free by the 64-year-old. The model is so popular that the city cor poration has been issuing trade licenses for ""Darshini type hotel"" since the mid-2000s.At the heart of a successful Darshini eatery is pricing. And that is achieved by scaling up operations while keeping things sim ple. ""Earlier, people used to put money on fancy interiors and charge food at three times its price.There was no quality and affordable food for students and working population,"" recalls Prabhakar.At the age of 27, he was already a businessman running a grocery store in Basavanagudi. Prabhakar, whose father G Ranganath ran Udupi hotels in Mumbai and Solapur after leaving Kundapur , had insights into the food industry after helping manage the familyowned Nithyanand Coffee Bar in Basavanagudi. Adulteration and high prices bothered him. A trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Europe helped him come up with a solution. ""I saw KFC and McDonald's and realized that we needed south Indian fast food restaurants,"" says Prabhakar.Back home, Prabhakar adapted the self-service restaurant model at his brother-in-law's Cafe Darshini, which required minimal investment in real estate and labour. ""No body took it seriously as they thought fast food won't work. Then they saw the rush and high turnover,"" smiles Prabhakar.A number of Darshinis came up and Prabha kar became the go-to mentor for food entre preneurs.G Srini vasa Rao, chairman and MD of Mayura Group, still recalls Prabhakar's suggestion to serve 120 ml soup for Rs 5 in 1996. ""I was new to Bengaluru and he was called Darshini Brahma by then. I followed what he suggested and it was a big hit,"" says Rao. That suggestion built the iconic Cool Joint in Jayanagar. ""He knows three things: how to ensure quality of food, what kind of food locals will like and at what price.Cool Joint's sandwich and soup menu was revolutionary,"" he says.Entrepreneurs like R Vasudevan of Hot Chips sought out Prabhakar when the time came for expansion. ""He advised us to keep the price low with no compromise on quality,"" says Vasudevan. But how to sell coffee for Rs 3 in 1995 and make a margin? ""He asked us to focus on volume; that is to sell 2,0003,000 coffees a day,"" says Vasudevan. Prabhakar also told which Coorg coffee to buy and sent experts to train the team in coffeemaking. The experiment worked, says Vasudevan whose 30 self-service restaurants now have a turnover of Rs 100 crore.""This is the model he created even before KFCs and others came to India. By the time the international chains came in, we realized how good his foresight was. He had prepared us even before the competition came in,"" says Vasudevan.Innovations didn't stop there. There was food by weight concept, food trucks, dosa camps, the rural-themed Halli Mane, much ad mired by writers like UR Ananthamurthy, and jazzy new outlets like Taaza Thindi and South Kitchen. ""The interiors and hygiene have to be good to appeal to young sters. There are many north Indians in Bengaluru who are homesick. So food has to appeal to them too,"" says Prabhakar.Despite a nerve problem leading to vision loss, Prabhakar remains active. ""His latest project is South Kitchen. Finally , the family owns something that he has created, after he sold off the original Cafe Darshini all those years ago,"" says Santhosh Prabhakar, his son, who runs cafeterias for corporates.At one point, Prabhakar was so focused on helping others that he stopped running his retail business. Then there were threats from people whom he exposed through media campaigns as adulterators.""My family wanted me to stop my consulting and campaigning. But I didn't stop,"" smiles Prabhakar.His children Seema and Santhosh say that they understand their father's passion for social justice. Santhosh says his father was shaped by the ups and downs any businessman goes through.Though his lack of interest in profit-making occasionally puzzles him, he is happy that Prabhakar tried to make the food industry more process-oriented.There is no quiet retired life for Prabhakar. He continues to consult and remains vocal about 18% GST being ruinous to small eateries. As for the ambitious plan of Karnataka government to start affordable canteens, he is blunt. ""It is going to be a 100% failure as there is no planning,"" says Prabhakar. Unlike in Chennai, which pioneered the popular Amma canteens, real estate is costly in Bengaluru. But where to cook food hygienically? It might work if they have a centralized kitchen and food trucks to sell the items,"" he says.As they say, it is all about the process with Prabhakar."

According to the plan, 55 acres would be brought under plantation of citrus plantation varieties of Kinnow, Daisy and W Murcott. In 2018, 170 acres would be brought under Carrizo, JattiKhatti and Carrizo rootstock liners. Likewise, 300 acres of area would be brought under Carrizo, JattiKhatti and Volk liners during 2019, 2020, and 2021, to expand the ambit of citrus cultivation in order to tap the land potential in the state.The chief minister, while reiterating his government's commitment to farm diversification to improve the lot of the state's beleaguered farming community, directed additional chief secretary, horticulture, Himmat Singh to work out the modalities for the citrus project in collaboration with PepsiCo.The chief minister urged the delegation to further explore opportunities for the farmers of south Punjab to be a part of the project while directing the horticulture department to give liberal subsidies for schemes like drip irrigation. He also asked the department to prepare a comprehensive action plan to adequately enhance the capacities of the two existing Punjab Agro juicing plants, at Abohar and Hoshiarpur, to meet the juicing demands of PepisCo.Amarinder directed the CEO Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion to make the proposed new industrial policy conducive to the juicing industry to enable the state's farmers to reap the maximum benefit by getting a remunerative price for their crop. He also asked the principal secretary to take up the matter of ensuring eight hour uninterrupted power supply to the orchards with the chairman-cum-managing director, Punjab State Power Corporation."

It had, however, increased the reverse repo rate -- which it pays to banks for parking funds with it -- by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent, narrowing the policy rate corridor.As per the new series data, industrial output growth slowed to 2.7 per cent in March as against 5.5 per cent a year ago."
184,April price path offers comfort,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170513/jsp/business/story_151311.jsp,2017-05-13,Telegraph,"New Delhi, May 12: The rate of inflation, both wholesale and retail, remained benign in April. While the wholesale price index dipped to a four-month low of 3.85 per cent, consumer inflation eased to its lowest in at least five years to 2.99 per cent, reviving a debate on whether the RBI should revisit policy stance even as most analysts expect it to hold rates for the time being. The government today came out with the new series of wholesale inflation data under which the base year for calculating the macroeconomic indicators has been revised to 2011-12 from 2004-05 earlier. According to the new series data released today, wholesale inflation in food articles was 1.16 per cent in April, lower than 3.82 per cent in March. The low food inflation was mainly because pulses saw a contraction of 13.64 per cent, so did vegetables (-7.78 per cent), potatoes (-40.97 per cent) and onions (-12.47 per cent). ""A new food index is being compiled combining the food articles under primary articles and food products under manufactured products. Together with the Consumer Food Price Index released by the Central Statistics Office, this would help monitor the price situation of food items better,"" a government statement said. Wholesale inflation in the fuel and power segment was 18.52 per cent, while that of manufactured products was 2.66 per cent in April.

""The new WPI series indicates a sustained trend of lower annual inflation rates when compared with the rather dated 2004-05 base, underscoring the importance of regular updation of the base to ensure that policy makers have access to timely and accurate information while framing policies in a dynamic economic environment,"" Aditi Nayar, principal economist with ICRA, said. The department of industrial policy and promotion updated the WPI by assigning revised weights and the list of items it tracks to better reflect the current reality. It also excluded indirect taxes while computing WPI to insulate it from fiscal policy changes. Retail prices Retail inflation eased to 2.99 per cent in April from 3.89 per cent in March because of the lower cost of food items, including pulses and vegetables. The consumer price index-(CPI) based retail inflation for March 2017 was revised slightly upwards to 3.89 per cent, from 3.81 per cent recorded previously. CPI inflation stood at 5.47 per cent in April 2016. ""CPI inflation for April provided a positive surprise, printing significantly lower than our expectations of 3.6 per cent, led primarily by food items and may well remain below 3.5 per cent in the ongoing quarter,"" Nayar said. The improved monsoon prospects and the upward revision in advance estimates of crop output have infused optimism, although the dip in reservoir levels remains a source of some concern. ""Given the fragile nature of growth, there is a strong reason why the RBI should return its stance to accommodative rather than the current neutral,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at L&T Finance Holdings. Other economists said, however, that with price pressures set to pick up again in the second half, the RBI would be more likely to hold its main policy rate at 6.25 per cent over the coming months. ""For the first half we expect the numbers to be fairly below RBI's trajectory,"" said Anjali Verma, economist at PhillipCapital India. ""However, in the second half it will be nearing 5 percent, which is in line with RBI's trajectory and, therefore, a rate cut is not anticipated."" India's improving inflation performance has pushed real interest rates - the amount by which they exceed inflation -strongly into positive territory. That has attracted buyers to the bond market and driven stocks to double-digit percentage gains in the current year."
185,Changing the way you live,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/612558/changing-way-you-live.html,2017-05-20,Deccan Herald,"Alok Ray May 20 2017, 2:59 ISTAdvertisers target children as, apart from being more impressionable, they are having an increasing say in family purchase decisions.Perhaps the quickest way to understand a societys culture is to study the advertisements. In fact, ads have a two-way link with society. Firstly, ads reflect the prevailing social mores and preferences of the people.For example, the matrimonial ads in India at one time used to seek as groom in order of preference: doctors, engineers, chartered accountants and, as last resort, professors. Some were even more categorical in specifying that the brides family would consider only doctors having degrees from UK and engineers from IITs. Then, over time, with the rising flow of Indian IT professionals abroad, such people working in USA, and Europe began to occupy the pride of place in the list.For some families, apart from enjoying a better material standard of living, staying abroad had the further attraction that it would enable the bride to stay away from the in-laws family. More recently, with MBAs  particularly from the top IIMs  typically earning more than engineers, IIM MBAs have entered the list. Also, an increasing number of matrimonial ads are asking for working brides, instead of housewives, to supplement family income. At the same time, the proliferation of fairness cream ads testifies the premium that the Indian society, by and large, still places on fair skin.It is also interesting to observe how the products promoted by the ads have changed over time. With rising affluence (and aspirations) of the new generation along with easier availability of bank loans for consumer products, the ads for simple consumer goods like basic soaps, detergents and tooth pastes are giving way to more upscale products like body perfumes, air conditioners, motor bikes, cars, LED TVs, smartphones, jewellery, diamonds, flats and villas.Secondly, advertisers  through their ads and promotional campaigns  try to change the tastes, habits, choices and the aspirations of the public. They would make you believe that life is largely meaningless if you dont have a smart phone, shoes, watch, perfume, motorbike, car of a specific brand to distinguish you from the hoi polloi or to make a fashion statement for you.Advertisers particularly target children as, apart from being more impressionable, they are having an increasing say in family purchase decisions in todays society. In addition, investing in changing their preferences is likely to yield higher returns as their life span is longer.In this game of marketing and promotion, celebrities play a significant role. This is an age-old technique. Older people would remember seeing ads in newspapers and movie theatres (long before the advent of TVs) depicting film stars like Nargis or Madhubala using Lux soap every day. The same tradition is continuing, except that the range of products promoted by film stars and sports personalities has widened enormously. Even some state governments are employing such personalities as brand ambassadors for the purpose of attracting tourists or investments.Why do companies pay enormous sums to hire the services of such celebrities to promote their brands? There are two possible reasons. One, the face of a celebrity attracts the viewers attention immediately to the ad and the product stays in the mind of the viewer through association.Second, the fact that a company can afford to pay the huge sum to the celebrity implies that the product must be a good one bringing a lot of revenue. That helps establish the quality of the product in the minds of prospective buyers.Should celebrities be held accountable for the quality of the product or the service being advertised by them? True, it is not possible for an outsider to know fully about the quality (including any fraudulent claims made by the company).Product qualityYet, the celebrities  because of their celebrity status being used to sell the product or service to unsuspecting people  should exercise due diligence before endorsing. Since they are earning huge money, at least they should be made to pay some monetary penalty if they are found endorsing a product making false claims. That would make them more circumspect.Do companies have to spend on ads to survive? In theory, if the products being sold by different firms are identical in quality and consumers also think so, then it does not pay for any firm to spend on ads. Since the identical products would sell at the same price, the extra cost incurred on ads cannot be recovered.That is why we dont see ads for potatoes or tomatoes but find ads for different brands of potato chips and tomato ketchups (as these are not considered identical by consumers). At the other extreme, a monopolist  because he gets 100% market share by definition  cannot gain by spending on ads except when the ad helps expand the total market of the product by making more consumers aware of the product or an improved variety of the product or by enhancing the image of the company by advertising its CSR activities.Is so much spending on ad socially justified? Here a distinction needs to be made between ads to disseminate information and ads to take away sales from the competitors. The first type provides some useful service to the society. The second does not add any net social benefit. One firms gain is cancelled by another firms loss.While ads at tax payers expense aimed at changing social attitudes like open defecation, child marriage, demanding dowry etc are justified, wastage of national resources occurs when politicians use page-long ads to promote themselves under the pretext of informing the public about the laying of foundation stone for a project.If providing information is the objective, a simple press note in the media or a smaller ad without the names and photos of the numerous ministers and politicians should do.(The writer is former Professor of Economics, IIM-Calcutta)"

Pooran says he got a little late waiting for a job, and is now preparing for the Rajasthan governments recruitment exam for sub-inspectors.Pooran sits patiently as a group of women perform wedding rituals, placing dhania (coriander) seeds in his hand, while singing traditional folk songs.There have been several instances recently of Dalit weddings being disrupted by upper and dominant castes in Rajasthan and in other states, but the Bairwas are not worried about that today.Khushi walks out to welcome him in what will be their first meeting(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Khushi walks out to welcome him in what will be their first meeting(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)It is a funeral, instead, that everyone talks about; a funeral two years ago that led to a Dalit protest, which eventually made the Rajputs of the village relent, and made wedding celebrations like Poorans possible.How can we forget? says Santram, Poorans 47-year-old cousin. It happened on March 14, 2015. Jaise hi unhone hamein arthi le jaate dekha, hum par hamla kar diya aur arthi ko dhakka diya. Murda zameen pe gira diya. Hum sabko bada gussa aaya (The moment they saw us carrying the body on a bier, they attacked and pushed it. The body fell. We were furious), he says.In the violence that followed, Santram and 15 other Dalits were assaulted by Rajput members of the village. There had been clashes before but this time, Santram decided not to let go and filed an FIR. Eighteen persons were booked and five arrested.It was then, he says, that the Rajputs relented. They called me and said you do whatever you want, we will not bother you anymore, says Santram, the relief still showing through the triumph in his voice.The same year, Santram contested the 2015 panchayat elections but could not win, though the Bairwas constitute the majority by far, with 150 households compared to 20 Rajput and three Jogi homes. They didnt even let Kanshi Ram (the late BSP founder) win. Who am I? he says with a wry smile.According to the National Crime Records Bureaus Crime In India report 2015, Rajasthan has the highest rate of crimes against Scheduled Castes in the country (57.2, calculated per lakh population). However, says Karauli DSP Prakash Chand, under whom Mehndipur falls, the incidents have come down significantly in the past few years. It is chiefly due to education and awareness about legal provisions. We usually try to solve such situations by talking to both parties, and it works most of the time. Two months ago, we received a complaint from Mehndipur so we sent some forces in plainclothes.Baraatis dancing to a local band, which was also once denied to Dalits by upper castes Baraatis dancing to a local band, which was also once denied to Dalits by upper castesRajkumar Bairwa, sarpanch of Sankarwada, under which Mehndipur falls, says, There have been practically no incidents since the 2015 funeral. The Rajputs also know that the legal provisions in such cases dont even allow bail. That has proved to be a major deterrent, besides education.Since 2015, the village has seen 8-10 weddings without any disruption, including Deendayals. Last year, the 33-year-olds baraat was taken out under heavy police protection. Baraatiyon se zyaada khaki vardi wale they. Aisa lag raha tha jaise kisi VIP ki shaadi hai (There were more policemen than baraatis, like it was a VIP wedding), he laughs. Police say they deployed the force more as a precaution.That was the last wedding in the village that required such protection.Today, as Poorans baraat wades through the Rajput area, children come out on the rooftops to watch. Pooran is riding a horse, wearing a turban and carrying a sword, all traditionally upper caste symbols, and unthinkable at a Dalit wedding until recently.The sword Pooran is carrying had been used by his elder brother Ram Singh. If swords cant be had, the Dalits use a stick to hit the toran (auspicious decoration) while entering the brides residence, as part of a wedding ritual.The wedding will cost Poorans father Ranjeet Singh Bairwa, a construction contractor based in Delhi, around Rs 2 lakh. The horse and the DJ/band cost Rs 15,000. A wedding band is also a newly acquired indulgence for the Dalits. The Bairwas have paid Rs 10,000 for a local band, which includes a small pick-up truck with a music player and large speakers loaded in the back.Pooran in the Tavera hired for the wedding, with cars a safe mode of travel(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Pooran in the Tavera hired for the wedding, with cars a safe mode of travel(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)While he studied only till Class V, Ranjeet has managed some amount of financial security for his family. Among the achievements he is most proud of is the small Vaishno Devi temple he has got constructed near their house. Pooran stops here to pray before getting on the horse.Poorans mother Rampati and eldest sister Guddi smile, as a village woman comments, Forget the turban. Earlier, we had to carry our jutis (shoes) on our heads before upper castes. But now there is no problem. Now we have a band, a horse, everything.While Guddi did not study, Poorans three younger sisters studied up to Class 12.Yahin giraya tha murda us din (This is where the body fell that day), says Ranjeet, as they cross the family temple, shouting to make himself heard over the auto-tuned songs set to electronic beats being played by the DJ.The sword Pooran is carrying had been used by his elder brother Ram Singh. The sword Pooran is carrying had been used by his elder brother Ram Singh.As the baraat sets out, a mild dust-storm rises. The overcast sky mutes the evening sun and a strong breeze brings some respite to the wedding party.The wedding band is playing the songs of local favourites Raju Rawal and Shambhu Meena, which encompass everything from the timeless love of Radha and Krishna to demonetisation. The two singers have been creating waves across East Rajasthan, in the faultlines between its rural and urban areas, with their paeans to the Prime Minister.Tonight, the hundred-odd baraatis burst into a brisk dance to the beats of Waah re Mhara Modiji. Achha achha kanjoosa ki neend uda di re/ waah re mhara Modiji ka lehar chala di re; Paanch sau, hazaar upar rok laga di re/ kaala dhan ki tijori ki vaat laga di re; Ek raat mein paaso paltyo koi samajh ni paayo/ arre suntan hi TV mein news ghano paseeno aayo; Surgical strike se Pakistan hilayo/ greeban ki samajh bhavna dukh mein saath nibhayo; Arre kerosene ki kaala bazari band karwa di re/ waah re mhara Modiji kai lehar chala di re (Modiji has made the stingy sweat, sent the black marketeers running, turned the tables in a night, stunned Pakistan, heard the poor, ended the black market in kerosene).Bemused at the choice of song, Poornas cousin Suresh Bairwa says the band culture has only taken off in the last eight-10 years among Dalits. Before that, it used to be quiet. The groom would leave with women singing auspicious songs, and stop at homes of elders for blessings.Despite the song, the demonetisation cash crunch is itself a thing of the past. Pooran flaunts a three-layer garland of the new Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes, placed around his neck by relatives.The baraat waits for the bride to get ready at Khushis home(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The baraat waits for the bride to get ready at Khushis home(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Poorans brother Ram Singh, who is with the Army Medical Corps, has come for the wedding from his posting in Manipur. The 35-year-old says one major driver of the change in caste equations in the village are government jobs, preferably ones that come with a uniform, providing the Dalits a level playing field and social privilege.That is perhaps why the three young Dalits with jobs in the Army, BSF and CRPF in the village are role models for the community. Vardi vale ko haath lagane se pehle dus baar sochega koi (One will think ten times before laying a finger on a person in uniform), says 21-year-old Sanjay, who wants to join the Army.While most elder Dalits have had partial or no education, they are keen that their children study. However, though several young men want to join the forces, only a few make it. The preparation for the exams, the books, the coaching etc cost money.Sanjay is apprehensive about his chances. Mushkil hoti hai, coaching ke bina nahin ho paata. Maine physical clear kar liya tha, lekin merit list mein nahin aa paaya (It is difficult without coaching. I had cleared physical but couldnt make it to the merit list), he says.After riding around 40 minutes on the horse, Pooran disembarks and gets into a rented Chevrolet Tavera, decorated with artificial flowers and strips of satin. He rides with a young nephew and three relatives, who are coming along to take care of logistics that might arise on the way.The vehicle has been hired for Rs 3,100. The family has also hired 10 Jeeps to ferry guests to the brides village. Some relatives use their own cars while most others cover the 12-km distance on their bikes.There are 8-10 families in Poorans village that own a car. They are well-to-do. Some are contractors. We couldnt afford to buy one because we had to marry off four daughters, says Ranjeet.Pooran waits in tremulous anticipation. Pooran waits in tremulous anticipation.It is cars that have truly liberated Dalit weddings. Non-traditional, they have become a standard since riding a horse could invite trouble from upper castes.In 20 minutes, the baraat reaches Darjapur Patti, the brides village. Darjapur Patti lies adjacent to a Meena-dominated village and some guests mistakenly stop at a wedding there. We just had water, clarifies a baraati later.The reception is low-key since Darjapur Patti has banned loud bands or DJs for all communities. The Meena caste panchayat took that decision. Since we dont have a direct approach road to our settlement, we have to go through their area. That means we cant play any band music either, says a Dalit villager, not wishing to be named.A carpet is laid on the road outside for the groom party to sit on, while waiting for the bride to get ready. Younger family members burst crackers while the baraatis are served rose-flavoured milk.Pooran waits in tremulous anticipation. It is an arranged marriage, and it is the first time he will be meeting Khushi, 24, who is in the second year of her B.A. course.With some moments to spare for the rituals to begin, Nanakram, 70, from nearby Pakhar village, is in a pensive mood. We dont want any of this the mare, the band. Why should the community waste time and money on these things when all they lead to is conflict? he says.However, says Sanjay, its not as simple as that. The older generation doesnt want to change anything. But we have decided to challenge them (the upper castes). Why cant we do what we want? Its our country too. Everyone understands the language of the fist Only then will our condition improve, he says, taking a walk through the village lanes bathed blue in the moonlight.The reception is low-key since Darjapur Patti has banned loud bands or DJs for all communities.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The reception is low-key since Darjapur Patti has banned loud bands or DJs for all communities.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Interestingly, unlike the other upper castes, the Dalits find Brahmins more than willing to pitch in for their weddings. Most of them come from the Mehndipur Balaji temple area, and can earn around Rs 1,100 in dakshina at a wedding like this. We have no issue with them. They dont discriminate, says Suresh Bairwa.If Brahmins are not available, a relative with basic knowledge of Sanskrit fills in. Pooran and Khushis wedding will be conducted by his fathers brother Gulab Chand.The Bairwas say they would have liked their upper caste neighbours to attend. We do invite them but they dont come since they dont want to eat with us. They will accept uncooked stuff but wont share a cooked meal, says Suresh. In the city, my upper-caste friends eat with me, at weddings etc. But when theyre back in the village, they stay away, he says.Dalits, in turn, are almost never invited to Rajput weddings.Pooran and Khushi exchange garlands.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Pooran and Khushi exchange garlands.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)There is some restlessness among the guests now. Its a hot, humid night with barely any breeze and they have been waiting outside Khushis house for two hours. There is some problem with the toran. They are trying to fix it, says Ranjeet.Paper plates loaded with sweet halwa made of coconut and lauki (bottle gourd) along with deep-fried potato snacks are passed around among the guests by the brides side. The naashta pacifies the restive baraatis for a while.Many, including the young and old, light up, puffing on bidis and cigarettes. There is no alcohol though. This is one upper caste convention they dont want to emulate, the Bairwas insist. We dont have alcohol or non-vegetarian food at our weddings. But those who want to drink make their arrangements anyway, says Sanjay, with a twinkle in his eyes suggesting his own little arrangement.The brides side looks relieved, with the first hurdle  the safe arrival of the wedding procession at their door  out of the way.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The brides side looks relieved, with the first hurdle  the safe arrival of the wedding procession at their door  out of the way.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)At about quarter to 11, Pooran and his baraatis enter the arched gateway erected to welcome the guests. The brides side looks relieved, with the first hurdle  the safe arrival of the wedding procession at their door  out of the way.Khushis father Ram Khiladi, a Grade III government schoolteacher earning around Rs 5 lakh a year, has got their three-room house painted in light-green pistachio hue  Khushis favourite colour  for the wedding. The railing of the roof is adorned with lights, with two electric lotuses flanking the palace-style decoration on each side.You cant upset the baraatis, Ram Khiladi says. I have already spent Rs 5 lakh. Her dress alone cost Rs 20,000.After a couple of minutes, Khushi arrives, dressed in a purple lehnga with a transparent dupatta covering her face. Girls in the village have started going to parlours to get ready, but Khushi has got dressed on her own. Pooran and she exchange garlands.The baraat passes a Meena village along way(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The baraat passes a Meena village along way(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)As the women from the brides side sing songs welcoming the groom, everyone moves to the open area where dinner has been laid out. While Khushi goes back inside the house, Pooran heads towards the reception area with his friends.At about midnight, Khushi again emerges. Women from her family surround her under the mandap and help her put on jewellery gifted by the grooms side  a mor for her hair, a rakhdi for her forehead, and an intricate necklace.She then comes to sit on the stage along with Pooran, and a wedding photographer takes their pictures, dictating various poses.Ram Khiladi says he wasnt worried about any upper caste interference at the wedding at their village. Education has changed the attitude of upper castes and more so us. Besides, there are legal provisions safeguarding us. So people want to avoid getting into trouble, says the 49-year-old.Khushis village is dominated by Meenas, who have about 200 households. There are only 20 Dalit families.Ram Khiladis son Rakesh (22) too got married this February without any trouble. We went with a ghodi, band etc, he says.It is an arranged marriage, and it is the first time he will be meeting Khushi, 24, who is in the second year of her B.A. course.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) It is an arranged marriage, and it is the first time he will be meeting Khushi, 24, who is in the second year of her B.A. course.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Left to himself, like other community elders, he too would go for simpler, less expensive weddings, he adds. We have been trying to bring down unnecessary expenses, like serving alcohol or other extravagant practices. But the girls side inevitably has to spend more.Vishnu Singh Sisodiya, the up-sarpanch of Gharoli village nearby and a Rajput himself, says they have also been trying to get community members to rise above symbolic and contentious matters. Earlier these symbols were claimed exclusively by the Rajputs because it was a matter of prestige for the bigger gharanas. It still happens in Rajput-dominated villages. In Mehndipur too, there was an issue related to a funeral. But times have changed. Im a Rajput myself but personally I feel these things should not happen. Whats the point? Cases are filed, people go to jail.Those who arent queuing up to get their pictures clicked with Pooran and Khushi have begun digging into the vegetarian spread: pooris, aalu ki sabzi, salad, raita and sweets. Most of the baraatis leave after dinner, with only those closest to the family sticking around till the pheras. That will be a while. It will probably be morning by then, sighs Ram Khiladi.Around 5 am, Khushi and Pooran finally leave for his home, in the rented car. It has been the grandest day of their lives.Santram says when they look back, thats what would matter, and not as much what all they could do despite the upper castes. Everyone realises these things, band, turban, horse, cost a lot, he says. Given a choice, we would not even want to follow these rituals. But the point is how can we not be allowed to follow them?Band, baaja, banApril 4, 2017Sanjay Kumar was beaten up reportedly for riding a mare in his wedding procession, in Sanjarwas village of Charkhi Dadri district in Haryana. Kumar required treatment along with other members of the wedding party. The ceremony was later performed under police protection. The Dalits named 21 Rajputs as being behind the attack, and alleged they also took away the mare. SHO of Baund Police Station Vikram Singh said 15 of the accused have been arrested, and they are looking for six more. We are trying to reach a compromise, said sarpanch Vikash Singh, an SC.April 6, 2017Vijay Kumars wedding procession was attacked by Rajputs in Gundusur village of Rajasthans Churu district for allegedly playing music on a loudspeaker. 10 Dalits, including women, were injured.

Together with the Consumer Food Price Index released by the Central Statistics Office, this would help monitor the price situation of food items better,"" a government statement said.As per the numbers, inflation in the fuel and power segment was 18.52 per cent while that of manufactured products was 2.66 per cent in April.Last month, the Reserve Bank had left the key policy rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent for the third review in a row, citing upside risks to inflation. It had, however, increased the reverse repo rate -- which it pays to banks for parking funds with it -- by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent, narrowing the policy rate corridor.As per the new series data, industrial output growth slowed to 2.7 per cent in March as against 5.5 per cent a year ago.

188,Centre blames Odisha for onion distress,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/may/23/centre-blames-odisha-for-onion-distress-1608017.html,2017-05-23,The New Indian Express,"BHUBANESWAR: With onion growers of the State crying foul over plummeting prices, the Centre on Monday blamed Odisha Government for failing to check distress sale.The State Government could have taken resort to market intervention scheme (MIS) to provide remunerative prices to farmers. It seems the State is not keen on taking the financial burden to protect farmers from selling their produce at distress price, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told a BJP delegation from Odisha.The basic objective of MIS is to provide remunerative prices to farmers in case of glut in production and fall in prices. However, the MIS is implemented on specific request of the State Government willing to share the loss with Central Government on 50:50 basis, Singh said.It has been brought to my notice that Odisha farmers are incurring huge losses due to fall in prices of onion which is being sold at `3-4 a kg. But there is no proposal yet from the State Government for market intervention under MIS, the Union Minister told the delegation.The Uttar Pradesh Government has taken the benefit of the scheme this year to protect potato growing farmers, Singh said and added that Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had successfully gone for market intervention under MIS last year.Stating that MIS is for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are generally perishable in nature, the Union Minister said though funds are not allocated to the States, the Centre shares the loss of farmers based on specific proposals received from them.With a bumper harvest of onion this year, the State is staring at a possible crisis of the vegetable due to lack of storage facility. As the Centre expects about six per cent decrease in onion production against last year, it has advised the State Government to take timely ameliorative measures to tackle any potential crisis in onion during the lean season.On the day, the State Government advised the Horticulture Department to give stress on informing farmers to store their produce to meet the demand during crisis time.Though the State Government is giving 50 per cent subject to a maximum of `87,500 for construction of onion storage facility under Horticulture Mission, there are hardly any takers.While a 20-tonne onion storage facility costs about `1.75 lakh, the farmers have to bear the cost to reimburse the subsidy amount later. Most of the onion growers do not have the financial capability to spend such a huge amount, official sources said."

In a reply to a question in the Assembly on May 9 2016, the CM had informed that 11.09 lakh hectares were covered under assured irrigation in 2015-16 kharif season. This is only 18 per cent of the total agricultural land of the State, BJP MLA Pradip Purohit told reporters here.Though many farmers in the State committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden, the Government refused to accept the fact to cover up its failure. Nothing could be more unfortunate than to claim that farmers of Odisha do not commit suicide. This shows the apathetic and insensitive attitude of the BJD Government, Purohit said.What happened to the State Potato Mission after three years of its launching? the BJP legislator sought to know from the Government.As per the Mission target, the State was supposed to be self sufficient in potato production. With its annual requirement of about 12 lakh tonnes of potato, Odisha had produced 2.68 lakh tonnes last year. Purohit attributed the failure to lack of storage capacity in the State.Quoting a reply of Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout in the Assembly, Purohit said only five cold stores of the Cooperation Department are functional while 13 have remained defunct. The Government has failed to revive a single cold store during the last 17 years.Even as the State has achieved self sufficiency in onion production, the farmers are selling their produce at throw away price due to lack of institutional support from the Government, he rued.Similarly, the State is way behind the national average in egg and milk production, Purohit added."

Through online bidding of products, the monopoly of local traders will be checked in determining the price of a product and farmers will get the highest price for their produce. According to official data, around 20 tonnes of ginger and eight tonnes of potato are grown by farmers in the district annually.According to a ginger grower, Sukdev Naik of Bankaput village under Pottangi block, last year he sold ginger at `8 per kg, while this year he sold the produce at `31 per kg through online bidding. He said about 24 co-farmers have sold 2.5 tonnes of ginger through e-NAM.The RMC secretary said e-NAM is being operated once a week on trial basis. There is need to create an awareness on this scheme, but he is hopeful that more and more farmers and SHG groups would join e-NAM."

We got our usual supplies. The situation will be the same tomorrow too. The problem will start if the strike doesnt end by Saturday. The wholesale markets are shut on Sunday.

Retailers could take advantage of the situation and hike the prices. We support farmers. Their issues should be resolved at the earliest.Sharad Pawar, a retailer in Turbhe, said, There will be rationing of stock by wholesalers on Tuesday. We will get limited supply. This will definitely affect prices of vegetables. Also, the demand from panicking consumers will rise.Sunil Shingre, a farmer from wholesale market, said, The government should waive our loans and also ensure that we get good prices for our crop. We have been taken for granted for long.Prakash Shahane, a vegetable vendor at Savarkar market in Dadar, said, We are asking our regular consumers to buy a little more.Suryakant Mahadev, who has a shop at Dadar market, said there will be clarity on the situation by Saturday.We have received our daily quota of milk products and there is no problem now, said Santosh Kadam, manager of the Naiguam branch of Apna Bazar.Consumers seem to be quite confused over the issue.

(Source: PTI Photo)Day one of the farmers strike in Maharashtra saw supplies of fruits, vegetables and milk being hit in major cities like Mumbai and Pune. While members of Kisan Kranti, the umbrella organisation of farmers which spearheads this unique strike, maintained that theirs was an apolitical movement, Sadashiv Khot, minister of state for agriculture and marketing, said the protest was politically motivated and was being fomented by people who have failed in their political career.Farmers across Maharashtra had decided to go on strike from June 1 as repeated talks with the state government had failed to resolve the stalemate. Yogesh Rayate, state level coordinator of Kisan Kranti said complete loan waiver of the farmers and implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendation about fixing of agricultural produce were their main demands. As the state government failed to respond to our demands, we had no other option but to go on strike, he said. In response, farmers across the state took to stopping vehicles of fruits, vegetables and milk towards urban areas. A call was also given to farmers not to provide milks to dairies and not to sell their agricultural produce in the wholesale markets.As a result of the call, wholesale markets in Mumbai and Pune reported a sharp dip in arrival of fruits and vegetables on Thursday while markets in Nashik, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar were completely closed. Rajendra Shelke, president of the potato and onion sellers in the Vashi wholesale market in Mumbai, said there was a dip of 35 per cent in the arrival of vegetables. Dilip Khaire, chairman of the administrative board of Pune wholesale market, said there was a dip of 50 per cent in arrivals.The onion market of Lasalagon in Nashik district was completely closed as not a single farmer came to sell his produce. Vashi traders maintained that in case the supply continues to get hit, the rise in the prices of commodities could not be ruled out. Stray incidents of violence were reported from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune where farmers took to damaging milk-carrying tankers as well as vandalising trucks carrying vegetables. In many areas, farmers emptied milk containers and dumped vegetables on the road. Police had reportedly taken action against some protesters in Nashik, Aurangabad etc.Dairies across the state had reported a dip in procurement of milk as farmers refused to provide milk and at places stopped milk tankers. R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)  the proprietor of Amul  said their milk procurement was hit in Maharashtra. Amul sells around 19 lakh litres of milk per day in the state and Mumbai is one of the major markets of the brand. We procure around 10 lakh litres from the state and the procurement was less today.In many places, the tankers were stopped, he said. Sodhi said while they were able to deliver milk on Thursday, if the strike continues, milk shortage could not be ruled out. Kolhapur-based Warna Cooperative Dairys milk tanker was attacked allegedly on Wednesday night near Satra, when it was transporting milk to Mumbai. B B Bhandari, general manager (transport) of the dairy, said they supply around 2.5 lakh litres of milk to Mumbai and procurement of the same was hit. We shall be transporting milk under police protection to Mumbai, but procurement has been hit, he said.An unfazed Khot said the state government will be able to ensure smooth supply of milk and vegetables to the urban areas. The people who are behind this strike are failed politicians who do not want the farmers to prosper, he said. Khot said the government was ready to talk and the on-going strike was not the solution. Rayate and other Kisan Kranti members, however, refuted Khots charges.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
194,Power crisis affects ice biz,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/power-crisis-affects-ice-biz/articleshow/58951163.cms,2017-06-01,The Times Of India,"PATNA: With fall in demand, decades-old cold storage units in the state capital have stopped producing and selling ice over the years. Many of them have even shut down due to power crisis and lack of subsidy.We hardly sell 60 to 70 slabs of ice that are used to protect fish, mutton and dead bodies in morgues during the peak summer season. Since a lot of power is consumed in producing and storing ice, we now preserve fruits in our factory, R S Multi-Cold Storage and Ice Factorys owner Dinesh Prasad said, adding the use of refrigerator in almost every house was one of the primary reasons behind the dwindling demand for ice.Two cold storage units in Digha and Anisabad have stopped producing ice on a large scale and mainly store agricultural products and potatoes now.According to Sunil Kumar and Dhananjay Singh, the owners of two factories in Danapur that do not manufacture ice any more, The requirement for ice is limited from April to June, but the process of producing and storing it consumes a lot of power. We began suffering huge losses due to repeated hikes in fuel surcharge, they said and added its more feasible to store agricultural products.Prakash Cold Storage owner Dev Prakash rued that running cold storages was no longer financially feasible. I stopped selling ice eight years ago as it was mainly used by ice cream and ice candy vendors or in wedding ceremonies. Now that most houses have refrigerators, the demand for ice has dipped. However, there are still some factories in the city that produce ice for small vendors and hospitals, he said.Mahabir Cold Storage in Danapur is one of the few cold storage units where the ice business has not been affected much over the years. A 50kg slab of ice costs anywhere between Rs 155 and Rs 200 and I sell nearly 55 blocks every day. The sale is likely to go up this month as Ramzan is set to begin from Sunday, owner Ranjeet Kumar told TOI."
195,Study to relate food habits to diseases in arid Barshi,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/mumbai-study-to-relate-food-habits-to-diseases-in-arid-barshi-4685028/,2017-06-01,Indian Express,"A study by the Tata Memorial Hospital will make a unique attempt to relate food habits of 2 lakh people in arid Barshi to commonly occuring medical conditions like cancer, brain stroke and cardiac attacks by analysing 120 recipes of food regularly consumed by the local population. A robobtic bio-laboratory is under construction to store blood samples of these locals.The long-term study called India Study of Achievable Health will analyse recipes of commonly cooked food in Barshi to understand the intake of nutrients, carbohydrates, proteins and calories by each individual. Doctors have found 120 commonly cooked food items like dal, brinjal, boiled potatoes and vegetables that are consumed in 364 villages in and around Barshi in Solapur district.Blood samples, blood pressure, data on tobacco consumption and physical exercise and alcohol intake of the 2 lakh people will be noted to measure risk factors. After five years, they will be tested again to check which individual has what disease and parallels will be drawn to co-relate food intake with stroke, obesity, heart ailments and cancer.The nutrient analysis through recipes will show a general salt, oil and red chilli intake by the locals. This will help in establishing traditional risk factors in cancer. The information will be helpful in co-relating several disease in future, Dr Rajesh Dikshit, in-charge of the Center for Cancer Epidemiology (CCE) at Tata Hospital said.The study will require a bio-laboratory to store the two lakh blood samples for at least five years. Specially designed by a UK-based firm, Liconic, a robotic system will be used to store and extract the blood samples from a cavernous, two-storey lab underway at the Tata Memorial Centres ACTREC (Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer) Hospital in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai.The training to instruct the robotic system was conducted in the UK. It will start functioning by July, said Dikshit. Liconic will start setting up the system from June and its technicians will work with the CCE for two years to handle the bio-lab.Set up at a cost of Rs 15 crore received from the Department of Atomic Energy, the laboratory will have the capacity to store 15 lakh blood samples under -80 degrees Celsius of liquid nitrogen. The CCE, which started in 2015, will work on collection and storage of blood samples for long term to create a data pool.The research project is expected to continue in Dervan and Goa but doctors may also include the Northeastern states of India for diverse blood samples.According to researchers, Barshi will help tap the rural populations diet while Dervan in Ratnagiri will provide coastal food choices of the locals. Similarly, the Northeast will provide an entirely different food preference data of its residents.Oncologist said the research will also show how good food habits can curb lifestyle diseases. Barshis example could help us know how urban residents can change diet to prevent risk factors. But that is a far-away plan for now, Dikshit said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

197,Govt bails out potato farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170602/jsp/northeast/story_154684.jsp,2017-06-02,Telegraph,"Guwahati, June 1: The Assam government is ready with 17,000 tonnes of potatoes if and when the state faces a shortage of the vegetable. Talking to the media today, agriculture minister Atul Bora said potatoes were bought from the farmers of the state, especially in Barpeta district, when its (potato) price witnessed a sharp fall. Farmers had to sell potatoes for Rs 2 per kg a few weeks back because of increase in production that prompted the state government to step in. It bought potatoes worth Rs 99 lakh from farmers. Bora said at present, four cold storages are functioning in the state and another three would be ready this year. He added the government had no data on amount of potatoes damaged because of farmers' failure to sell the vegetable on time this year. Bora today released a leaflet on work done by the Assam State Agricultural Marketing Board in the past year. He said the board had succeeded in increasing its cess collection despite closing down 18 checkgates which were one of the sources of cess collection. ""The amount of cess collected this year was Rs 19.71 crore more than last year. The increase was 35 per cent,"" said Bora. The collection of cess was Rs 76.03 crore as compared to Rs 56.32 crore last year. Bora said to ensure that farmers get a minimum price for paddy, the board had bought 16,000 tonnes of the crop in the past year through 41 paddy-procuring centres at Rs 1,470 a quintal. The board has decided to buy bao paddy for Rs 1,500 per quintal. On allegations of farmers about government-supplied paddy seeds not yielding the desired result, board chairman Palit Bora said the farmers did not follow the proper method of cultivation. ""There are 22 Krishi Vigyan Kendras in the state set up by the state government and three others set up by the Centre. But less than 10 per cent farmers visit these centres to take suggestions on how to cultivate paddy. We suggest they visit these centres,"" he said. Bora added the state government had allotted 50 bighas in Silchar to set up an inter-state terminal market which will be the first of its kind in the state."

Biju, president of the Federated Samiti which runs the Mattukatta eco-shop. Thus, the farmers and consumers are assured of a fair price.When we sell quality tapioca at Rs. 23, how long will the other merchants charge higher, Mr. Biju asks.The shops do not garner massive profits, just enough to keep them going.Sixteen clusters of farmers under the seven villages in Kattappana block sell vegetables for local supply through the eco-shops of the samiti, he added.Krishi Bhavans train farmers to use organic fertilizers and pest control measures.The main produce are beans (Hosur and local varieties), cabbage, green chilli, bitter gourd, brinjal, cucumber, tomato, pumpkin, okra, tapioca, banana and yam.Value-added itemsCrops not locally produced, for example onion, are brought from Kanthallur or markets in Tamil Nadu. We will soon produce potato and beetroot for local supply, said Mr. Biju, himself a farmer.The shops also sell value-added items produced at the Vandanmedu cluster unit including dried jackfruit, dried onion, and banana powder.Middlemen outKrishi Bhavan assistant director A.T. Thomas said the aim of the eco-shops was to avoid middlemen.He said local shop owners often created problems as they could not charge prices on their own.

Vada pav, the most popular street food of Mumbai, is also equally famous in the financial capital of India. The popularity of the poor mans burger is slowly catching up. No wonder, vada pav is growing in demand and popularity as the foodstuff will turn 50 this year! Interestingly, it has crossed the shores and slowly making waves in the US and the UK.The liking for vada pav actually cuts across class and generations as it is savoured by common man to celebrities. And the story of Mumbai is incomplete without vada pav, its signature dish. Celebrities have endorsed vada pav as their best fast food. Seeing a vada pav being made is one of the finest aromatic experience. Vada Pav is fresh, available 24x7 and a fast-moving food item.Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar's love for vada pav has been well documented and he had narrated how he used to eat it at Shivaji Park-Dadar, where he got the lessons of cricketing. I and my son (Arjun) love to eat vada pav at Shivaji Park Gymkhana and there is nothing that can beat this snack, laced with chutney, he once said, talking about one of his favourite snacks.In fact, on August 23 every year, the Vada Pav Day is celebrated. Most of the well-known travel and cuisine writers have covered widely about vada pav.It's not very clear as to who and when vada pav was first sold. But most believe that it was sold first in public somewhere in the mill heartland of Mumbai in the mid-60s, catering to the workers of what was earlier known as Girangaon, where at one point of time there were over 100 textile mills. Subsequently it spread to other parts of Mumbai and soon became a hit.Another version is that it started at a small stall owned by Ashok Vaidya outside the platform No 1 of the Dadar station. My father started it around 1966-67 and slowly it evolved, said his son Narendra.Most of the cafes and restaurants serve vada pav in Mumbai and there are several stories and tales attached to vada pav and anecdotes of celebrities. Aaram, the iconic restaurant located at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, gives Aaram vada pav. A stall outside Dadars Kirti College, has been attracting customers and is popular among celebrities. This is very popular among the celebrities.Among office goers of the Fort-Flora Fountain area, one of the famous places, is the CTO vada pav located near the Central Telegraph Office. There are several stalls along the maidans of Mumbai-- Shivaji Park, Oval, Azad, Cross Maidan, among others and these are fast food for the players.One of popular vada pav stalls was the khidki vada pav in Kalyan in Thane district, which was started in the late 1960s by the Vaze family, who used to sell vada pav from a window of their house facing the road. The Jai Maharashtra stall at Azad Nagar is another such place. Gajanan vada pav in Thane sticks to the traditional vada pav but what makes it different is their chutney.The vada pavs in inter-city trains like Deccan Queen (Mumbai-Pune), Flying Ranee (Mumbai-Surat) too have their own importance. Trains and food go hand in hand...and for trains arriving and departing from Mumbai it is about the taste of vada pav and how it changes from station to station, said foodie and independent journalist Ajit Joshi, one of the experts on Mumbai's business history. Vada pav in railway stations like Thane, Igatpuri, Karjat, Kasara, Khopoli and Virar are famous and people prefer it during their journeys as they go out of the city limits of Mumbai, added Joshi.The price ranges between Rs 10 and Rs 20 in street stalls and fast food joints.Vada pav has been part of the culture of this metropolis. People of Mumbai love it and it has now spread to most of the important cities of India, says veteran tourist guide Raj Suri, who also publishes tour guides and maps of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.Nowhere across the world such a food item has been so popular,"" said Sanjeev Sabde, veteran culinary expert and food writer. The taste of vada pav also varies from stall to stall and shop to shop, restaurant to restaurant....the vada pav of Kirti College would be different from Aram vada pav, he said.If fact, there are aspects of social and political colour to it as well. The Shiv Sena used vada pav stalls and haath-gaadis (push carts)to promote itself, said Prakash Akolkar, who has penned Shiv Sena  Jai Maharashtra. When a factory or a mill laid-off workers, the Shiv Sena would help the jobless to set up vada pav stands outside the factory, he said.The party, of late, had been encouraging the Shiv vada pav stalls. However, some organisations have challenged the Sena taking advantage of food stuff in the Bombay High Court.The Marathi compound word batata vada means potato fritter. Pav which is a variant of Portuguese po is sweetened bread. As far as calories are concerned, it is close to ameal. A 200 gram vada pav would have 290 calories, 25 gram fat, 25 gram carbohydrates and 5 gram protein, said chef Hiralal Patel. The ingredients in a vada pav allows you to keep on working for hours, he said.There was a serious need for a filling, light, nutritious, easy-to-carry snack for the morchas of millworkers, shipping unions, Shiv Sena rallies, said Ashok Thakur of Kirti College vada pav.Today vada pav selling has become an organised business. Chains like Jumbo King and Goli Vada Pav are catering to not only Mumbaikars but also people in different parts of India. Vada pav is available in some places in the US and the UK. Now, there are samosa-pavs, bhajia-pavs, usal-pavs, misal-pavs, variants which are also equally popular, especially among youngsters."

Unable to afford to expensive vegetables , they opted for the much cheaper chicken.""It is not that we didn't try, but is 250g of French beans cost Rs90, what can we do? We realized that our budget for the entire month would be badly hit. Ours is a big family comprising eight people. Chicken, being much cheaper, has come to the rescue. Vegetable supply might have resumed, but the cost hasn't come down,"" she said.From stockpiling vegetables to buying frozen foods or even turning non vegetarians, the middle-class is trying its best to tide over the crisis.""On Saturday, I went to a supermarket and bought some frozen or packed vegetables, mostly peas or drumstricks, but they turned out to be stale,"" said Arti Desai, a Hadapsar resident. ""Staples like potatoes or onions were out of stock. I finally boyght two brinjals for Rs65 from a local vendor. Pulses, rice and brinjals were all we had for the last two days,"" she added.Urmila Sankar, a Koregaon Park resident, is ruing not having a larger refrigerator. ""On Friday, we filled our fridge with vegetables, but could not fit them all. The vegetables we had kept outside spoiled in the humid weather. If this continues, we will be in a fix. We cannot have paneer every day. And now, even that is a luxury due to the milk shortage,"" she said.Her husband Murli, who had gone out to buy vegetables, was not a happy man either. ""I spent almost Rs500 to buy a kilo each of three vegetables. How can French beans cost almost Rs 80 for just 250g?"" he said."

But attempting to break the protests is not a victory. It is a failure.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis last week attempted to quell the agitation by promising a loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in phases. The decision will be firmed up by October 31, he said, prompting a few farmers groups to call the agitation off.The Sena taunted the government, saying it will have to take responsibility if even a single farmer commits suicide until then owing to financial burden.The Shiv Sena and farmers leader Raju Shetti, another BJP ally, extending their support to farmers on strike could become a headache for the Fadnavis government that succeeded in engineering a split among the farmers who are staging agitations.Meanwhile, officials from the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee at Vashi said the supply of onions, potatoes and other vegetables to Mumbai is likely to be adequate though prices have risen by 10-15 per cent. We are getting a supply of 60 trucks of potatoes from Pune and Ahmednagar districts. Although there hasnt been any supply from Nashik, there will be strong supply coming from outside the state. In terms of vegetables too, about 400 trucks are coming in, so Mumbai is likely to be unaffected."

Prices for tomatoes at the Dadar market had surged from Rs 15 to Rs 80 per kg for the past couple of days, before cooling down to Rs 50 a kg on Monday. In the suburbs, however, tomatoes continued to sell at upto Rs 100 per kg and coriander at Rs100 a bundle, though daily staples such as onions and potatoes were affordable at Rs18-20 a kg. The supply has greatly reduced and is poor in quality, said Pramod Desai, who owns a vegetable stall in Dadar. He estimates he had to throw out a third of the supply he got Monday, which comes from Nashik.The prices of other commodities rose too. Green peas, usually sold around Rs 80 a kg, were around Rs 120 per kg. The price of cucumbers had almost doubled, selling at Rs 90 instead of Rs 50 per kg. In Byculla, many shops remained shut over the past three days due to unavailability of supplies. We dont have any vegetables, what will we sell? said Aftab Ghaziani, who sells tomatoes.The situation at the Vashi APMC seemed better. The market supply was normalised Monday, according to wholesale traders. However, they expect the prices to be more volatile on Tuesday, as the afternoon supply was disrupted. Today, business was normal, said Nagesh Rao, a wholesale trader.Milk supply hasnt been affected in the city, as most people prefer packaged milk over fresh milk, according to the traders.Buyers have been forced to work with the rising prices. The only solution is to buy fewer vegetables, and hope that the prices stabilise soon. I usually buy 2 kg of tomatoes, but could only afford one the past week, said Prabhadevi resident Huzan Sheikh.At Vile Parle East Market, supply remains short and prices high. We have to charge triple, not even double. Many have been forced into closing shop. Even the limited supply we get is not good quality, as it rots when the lorries are stalled, said Manoj Kandu, a stall owner.Things seem to be looking up at Colaba market, as Badelal Kesarwani, a vendor there said, Prices have fallen since yesterday, and, hopefully, will begin to get back to normal soon. Milk supply has taken a hit as well, with dairies and suppliers complaining of shortage. We only receive 50% of the usual supply since the strike started, said Appa Kurade, who runs a dairy in Vile Parle.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

It has been the second year of a bumper onion crop with no buyers, forcing the government to announce a belated decision to procure the onions for Rs 8 per kilogram.Farmers are angry because the government neither made arrangements to procure the crop on time nor intervened to ensure a reasonable price. They threw onions on roads given the prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss.The distress is visible in the suicide numbers. From February 2016 to mid-February 2017, 1,982 farmers and farm labourers reportedly committed suicide, which was one-fifth of the total suicides in the state, where 21,000 farmers have taken their lives in 16 years.The National Crime Records Bureau attributed the reasons to crop failure, failure to sell produce, inability to repay loans, and other non-agriculture factors such as poverty and property disputes.The farmers should have been affluent if 20% growth figure given by the government is to be believed, said former state agriculture director GS Kaushal. But, he said, the reality was that input costs were rising and government failed to ensure remunerative price.MP farmer agitation: How the crisis unfolded June 1: Farmers begin a ten-day-long agitation in Madhya Pradesh demanding better price for their produce June 4: Clashes break out between police and farmers in Sehore, Indore and Bhopal districts, leaving six policemen injured June 4 afternoon: A delegation of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), which is affiliated to saffron parivar, defers farmers agitation following a meeting with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Ujjain June 4 evening: Enraged by the announcement of BKS, other two major organisations spearheading the agitation - Rashtriya Kissan Mazdoor Sangh and Bharatiya Kisan Union - say agitation had not been called off or deferred.

Experts say crop failure rate in the rain-fed regions is high.The state governments zero percent interest loan benefitted some farmers. But farmers in general were not able to claim benefits again as they were not able to repay the short-term loan. This, local government officials say, pushed farmers to local money-lenders, a reason for farmers to demand loan waiver.The governments bid to improve horticulture and food processing is mainly confined to paper, leading to farmers not getting benefits, much like farm owners in Punjab and Haryana."

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is likely to visit the spot on Wednesday. Curfew is clamped across the district.Angry farmers have said they will not cremate the five bodies unless chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visited the district, and have called for a strike supported by the opposition Congress. Many farmers have blocked the Neemuch-Mahu highway with the body of one deceased farmer.Last night police caned farmers who gathered at the mortuary. However, they allowed the bodies to be taken away in the wee hours. But we continue to stick to our demand that until and unless the CM visits the district, the cremation will not take place, said Patidar Samaj, Neemuch president Mahesh Patidar.

Customers had bought extra stock earlier. Few bought vegetables over the past three days owing to the rise in prices. Today, however, there has been a substantial increase in the supply, compared to the past few days, said Gangadhar, a vegetable vendor from Matunga market.Vendors at the APMC market in Turbhe, Navi Mumbai, reported that supply had returned to normal and prices had reduced on Wednesday. (Bachchan Kumar/HT)Ashok Walanj, APMC director who also represents the onion and potato market, said the market received 125 trucks carrying onions.Over the past few days, there was a shortage in supply. Today, however, we received a good supply of onions and potatoes. We got onions from all over Maharashtra except Nashik. We also got 50 trucks of potatoes. Prices are low, he said.Vendors said the supply of fruits had not been hit much. As it is the holy month of Ramzan, the middlemen cannot afford to stop supplying fruits. They have somehow managed to deliver a certain quantity of fruits daily. There has been some shortage, but our sup, said Prakash, a fruit vendor at Matunga market.The supply of fruits to Navi Mumbais markets was not affected much during the statewide farmers strike. (Bachchan Kumar/HT)The strike took an ugly turn in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday after protestors took to violence and police had to resort to open firing, in which five farmers were killed.As many as 350 trucks carrying vegetables arrived at the Navi Mumbai APMC market on Wednesday. Only 15 of these were from Maharashtra. About 320 vehicles supplied the market with vegetables on Tuesday.Parts of Maharashtra are only supplying us with minuscule quantities. However, there are arrivals from outside the state, which are taking care of the demand, said wholesaler Ganesh Pingle. He added that prices have not dropped much as supply is yet to return to normal in wholesale markets. In retail markets, however, prices have reduced.Prices in retail markets are expected to drop in the next few days. (Bachchan Kumar/HT)Mukund Pawar, a retailer, said prices may reduce over the next few days owing to steady supply. There should be a further drop in prices by Thursday."
207,Fields of unrest,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/fields-of-unrest-4695442/,2017-06-08,Indian Express,"There is a clear pattern to the farmer agitations currently on in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars. These farmers  unlike their brethren in drought-prone Marathwada, Vidarbha or Bundelkhand, who are largely into subsistence agriculture, and often resort to seasonal migratory employment  have seen good times, particularly through the first decade of this century till about 2013. This was a period of remunerative prices for most crops on the back of a global agri-commodity boom and domestic demand fuelled by rising incomes.The first setback to the above party came towards mid-2014, with the collapse of world commodity prices, leading to both falling exports and rising imports of farm products from the country. The current crisis, however, has to do more with domestic headwinds that may have some link with demonetisation. In virtually every crop marketed since November  whether soyabean, green gram, pigeon-pea and potatoes or tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, fenugreek, grapes and pomegranates  farmers have experienced huge price declines. The government claims this is mainly due to bumper production. But there is also a demand side. Produce trading in India is predominantly cash-based. The body blow this traditional agro-commercial capital has suffered due to demonetisation  and the inability of formal finance to fill the gap  may explain the apparent lack of liquidity in the markets now. With nobody really to buy and stock up, the speculative capital that used to buoy commodity prices has practically ceased to exist. And its farmers who have taken the ultimate hit.This situation is unsustainable, both politically and economically. But the solution cannot lie in farm loan waivers. Indebtedness is only the symptom of the actual disease, which is one of low prices and demand for produce. What the farm sector desperately needs is liquidity, which can come from institutional finance, modern agro-processing and organised retail, both domestic and foreign. While a zero GST rate on most primary farm produce is a welcome move, it needs to be supplemented with the removal of all restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports. There is also a case to impose higher import duties, especially on pulses and edible oils, as a temporary measure. If there can be anti-dumping duties and minimum import prices on steel or float glass, why not for products from the farm  more so, in todays troubled times?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

209,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,Indian Express,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

212,Farmers’ ire not about loans alone,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-ire-not-about-loans-alone/articleshow/59078066.cms,2017-06-09,The Times Of India,"The farmers'agitation in MP, and before that in Maharashtra, has pushed a simmering agrarian crisis into the spotlight.Earlier, the newly elected UP government announced a loan waver for small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra government said it was exploring the possibility. The Centre itself had announced that it would strive to double farmers' incomes by 2022. All these were raising expectations of farmers, especially after enjoying a good monsoon and record harvest in 2016-17, after two consecutive years of drought.Yet why are farmers - the lifeline of India - angry and resentful?One of the key factors fuelling agrarian anger is that good year or bad year, they are unable to earn enough. There is always a mismatch between their cost of production and what they get in the mandis. A quick comparison of cost of production and farm harvest prices as data collected by the agriculture ministry reveals the mismatch for 2014-15, the last year for which such information is available.In several states, for several widely cultivated produce like paddy and wheat, prices at which farmers are selling their harvest are actually lower than what they spent in cultivating the crop. In Madhya Pradesh, the epicenter of current agitation, paddy was fetching 15% less than cost of production while wheat was giving them just 2% profit.MP has emerged as a major player on the national scene exhibiting an agricultural growth rate of 9.7% between 2005-06 and 2014-15 compared to 3.6% for India as a whole. Share of agriculture in MP's gross state domestic product has increased from 25% to over 30% in this period. Area under vegetables and fruits has increased by 78% since 2010-11. According to a study done by Ashok Gulati and his colleagues at ICRIER, expanded irrigation, strong procurement system for wheat and bonus over its minimum support price and expansion of all-weather roads to connect farmers to markets have led to this boom in agriculture.Yet, after enjoying the boom for several years, the state's farmers have ended up in the same trap that has been haunting their brethren in other states. The reason why farmers don't get suitable margins is because of their input costs  water, diesel, fertiliser, etc. For cultivating wheat in MP, Rs 1,241.34 were spent on fertilisers per hectare in 2004-05 which has more than doubled to Rs 2,695.27 per hectare in 2014-15. Similarly, cost of seeds used in one hectare increased from Rs 998 in 2004-05 to Rs 2,653 in 2014-15. Even cost of irrigation has jumped from Rs 1,961.50 to Rs 2,599.55 in this period. These and other costs like labour, agricultural machinery hiring charges, pesticides, rents, have all gone up while prices that farmers get have lagged behind.As recently reported, support prices may be higher than what farmers get but getting payments is so difficult that farmers often have to sell to traders at lower prices. This dire situation is also causing mounting indebtedness of farmers with over half of agricultural households in debt as per an NSSO survey for 2012-13. MP was reported to have 46% debt ridden farmers.Should farmers diversify to get more value for their crops? This would appear to be a way out except that even in those cases, farmers' margins plummet after some time. UP's potato farmers were getting a measly 5% profit, while in Punjab, cotton farmers have suffered enormous losses of as much as 20%."
213,Why a problem of plenty is hurting farmers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/616449/why-problem-plenty-hurting-farmers.html,2017-06-09,Deccan Herald,"Soutik Biswas, International New York Times, Jun 10 2017, 0:07 ISTFarmers are on the boil again in India. In Maharashtra, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with the police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop.The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation.Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to the countrys GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived.In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops  the government sets prices for farming and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of Indias controversial withdrawal of high-value notes  popularly called demonetisation  late last year.The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers begged and borrowed from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me.So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop.Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say theres not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash.A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asias biggest onion market, in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of Indias annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were exaggerated. There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways, Manoj Kumar Jain said.Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crisis is actually rooted in Indias chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers, said Ashok Gulati, an agriculturespecialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly.In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted.In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4 degrees. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee for every kg of onion a month.So the government needs to make sure  or even subsidise  to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasnt been able to make that happen, Gulati said. For one, India just doesnt have enough cold storages.There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers.Secondly, theres not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops dont perish or go waste. Take onions, again. One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, less than 5% of Indias fruit and vegetables is processed.Regressive methodThirdly, farmers in India plant for new harvest looking back at crop prices in the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices.If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales.You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last years prices, says Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul. Punjab, Indias granary, is a perfect example.At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater. Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability.They (the policies) are distorting the choices that farmers make  those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing wheat we no longer need, says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy.But the best that the governments here do is to quickly raise crop buying prices and alleviate the farmers suffering.Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes  and announce a controversial farm loan waiver  and quell a simmering farmers revolt .The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same."

215,Fields of unrest,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/fields-of-unrest-4695442/,2017-06-09,Indian Express,"There is a clear pattern to the farmer agitations currently on in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars. These farmers  unlike their brethren in drought-prone Marathwada, Vidarbha or Bundelkhand, who are largely into subsistence agriculture, and often resort to seasonal migratory employment  have seen good times, particularly through the first decade of this century till about 2013. This was a period of remunerative prices for most crops on the back of a global agri-commodity boom and domestic demand fuelled by rising incomes.The first setback to the above party came towards mid-2014, with the collapse of world commodity prices, leading to both falling exports and rising imports of farm products from the country. The current crisis, however, has to do more with domestic headwinds that may have some link with demonetisation. In virtually every crop marketed since November  whether soyabean, green gram, pigeon-pea and potatoes or tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, fenugreek, grapes and pomegranates  farmers have experienced huge price declines. The government claims this is mainly due to bumper production. But there is also a demand side. Produce trading in India is predominantly cash-based. The body blow this traditional agro-commercial capital has suffered due to demonetisation  and the inability of formal finance to fill the gap  may explain the apparent lack of liquidity in the markets now. With nobody really to buy and stock up, the speculative capital that used to buoy commodity prices has practically ceased to exist. And its farmers who have taken the ultimate hit.This situation is unsustainable, both politically and economically. But the solution cannot lie in farm loan waivers. Indebtedness is only the symptom of the actual disease, which is one of low prices and demand for produce. What the farm sector desperately needs is liquidity, which can come from institutional finance, modern agro-processing and organised retail, both domestic and foreign. While a zero GST rate on most primary farm produce is a welcome move, it needs to be supplemented with the removal of all restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports. There is also a case to impose higher import duties, especially on pulses and edible oils, as a temporary measure. If there can be anti-dumping duties and minimum import prices on steel or float glass, why not for products from the farm  more so, in todays troubled times?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

PTI A truck set on fire by protesters near Bhopal on Friday. PTIA leader of an RSS-affiliated farmers union has said that both the Centre and state governments have failed to provide relief to farmers who have been suffering because of low prices of their produce.Farmers have been angry for a long time. The situation was about to explode anytime. The government could not understand it. Now the issue is completely politicised, Prabhakar Kelkar, national vice-president of RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), told The Indian Express.The remarks came amid farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh and the death of five farmers in police firing in Mandsaur.What you have seen in Mandsaur is just the reaction of a small fraction of farmers. The governments (Narendra Modis and Shivraj Singh Chouhans) promised many things in the last three years. They did do something, too. But nothing is seen on the ground, he said.Kelkar said the state intelligence had failed to see the calls on social media and give the right feedback to the government. He warned that things had gone out of control and the unrest could spread to other states, affecting the image of the BJP and the PM. Onions and potatoes are also lying with farmers. They will not be able to store them once monsoon begins. The anger will intensify. The government should start procuring the produce, he said.Kelkars remarks came on a day S Bhupinder Singh Mann, a leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union, another farmers body, wrote an open letter to the PM reminding him of his promises to farmers regarding MSP and a debt waiver. Expressing pain over the killing of farmers in Mandsaur, he wrote, Instead of fulfilling the promises and listening to the protesting farmers, you chose to issue two full-page advertisements in newspapers by spending crores of rupees just to make false claims on achievements on agriculture and cover up your failures.BJPs Kisan Manch chief Virendra Singh Mast justified the farmers protest, saying agitation was part of democracy. According to the MP, it was administrative failure that led to the agitation turning violent. I have written to the PM and CM to consider procuring farm produce for midday meals, security forces and police forces, he said.However, Singhs party colleague Hukumdev Narayan Yadav, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture, said those who were taking up arms, indulging in violence, looting and destroying public property were not following democratic practices. It is not kisan andolan, it is ugravadi andolan, which would not have been appreciated by Mahatma Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia or Deendayal Upadhyay, the MP said. Their demands are just, but we cannot support violence.Yadav, the BJP MP from Madhubani who often takes up the causes of farmers in the Lok Sabha, asked the government to form a committee with agriculture experts and farmer leaders to draft a law that would enable the entire farming community to benefit from the loan waiver scheme. The worst sufferers are small and marginal farmers, most of whom do not borrow money from banks but local sources. They also should get loan waiver, he said.He added that those who still have not been able to digest the fact that ordinary people from backward communities like Modiji and Chouhan reached high positions have conspired against them and misled the farmers to protest.Hukum Singh, the BJP MP from Kairana who has been vocal on farmers issues, refused to comment on the current unrest.Nityanand Rai, the BJP MP from Bihars Ujiarpur, asserted that both Modi and Chouhan have been working hard for the welfare of farmers and blamed the Congress for putting oil into the fire in Madhya Pradesh. However, he admitted that the Mandsaur incident should not have happened.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A few areawise disparities in the prices of some vegetables remained.Tomatoes and onions were being sold at an average price of Rs 15 to 20 per kg in most areas while cauliflower, brinjal and cabbage ranged between Rs 30 to Rs 60 per kg.Vegetable vendor Shankar Surve from Shivaji Market in Camp said retail prices of all vegetables were back to the normal level from June 8 as they were before the farmers' strike.""We also saw normal supply into the wholesale market on Thursday and Friday . Except for leafy vegetables, which always see an increase in price during the first couple of weeks in June, most vegetables like capsicum, brinjal and cabbage were being sold at Rs 30 per kg in Camp,"" he said.Leafy greens are usually up costwise during this time of the year due to inclement rainfall in some parts of the state, which destroys produce or an almost lack of rain resulting in less water supply for the vegetables, sources in the retail industry said.Most leafy vegetables, including fenugreek, spring onions and coriander, were priced at Rs 25 per bunch in the retail markets, currently .Vegetables that arrive in Pune's wholesale market come from the surrounding villages and from other states.For instance, a significant amount of okra comes from Gujarat, potatoes come from Indore. Within Maharashtra, a bulk of produce to the Pune market comes from Jalgaon, Solapur, Satara, Kolhapur, Karad and Bhigwan, among other regions.A vegetable vendor said prices in his area are just 10% above the normal due to less supplies in the wholesale market. ""The supply has reduced as farmers are currently involved in sowing for the kharif season. However, normal supplies may be expected in the next few days,"" he said.In most areas, vegetable prices have come down considerably in comparison to the initial days of the farmers' strike. Ranjeet Pawar, a vendor in Pimple Saudagar, said prices normalized a couple of days ago and most vegetables are below Rs 50 in his area.""Cauliflower was Rs 50 per kg two days back, but has now dipped to Rs 45. Chillies still cost Rs 68 per kg,"" Govind Singh, a vendor in Baner, said.Anand Mali, a chef, said, ""Vegetable prices in Mandai have dropped to the normal.However, retailers tend to charge erratically even now.Leafy vegetables, however, remain costly in comparison."""

221,Delegation of farmer organisations to visit Mandsaur on June 11,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/jun/11/delegation-of-farmer-organisations-to-visit-mandsaur-on-june-11-1615261.html,2017-06-11,The New Indian Express,"NEW DELHI: A delegation of farmers organisations are likely to hold meetings with farmers in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, where five famers were killed in police firing.The group consisting of members of over a dozen farmers organisations also extended support to the farmers of Madhya Pradesh who are agitating for their legitimate demand that the BJP-led central government and state government should fulfill all promises made by them in their central manifesto of 2014. The delegation is likely to visit the town on June 11-12.VM Singh of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, Dr Sunilam of Madhya Pradesh Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, Yogendra Yadav of Jai Kisan Andolan, Avik Saha of Jai Kisan Andolan, K. Balakrishnan of Swaraj Abhiyan and Somnath Tripathi of Swaraj Abhiyan are also part of the delegation. This initiative is also supported by Paschim Odisha Krishak Sangathan Samanvay Samiti, Narmada Bachan Andolan, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Rayathu Swarajya Vedike, and Samajwadi Samagam. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan started a fast on Saturday to resolve the farmers crisis.Slamming the fast, Congress said that inaction of the state government forced the farmers to sell their crop below minimum support price to the middlemen.Terming the indefinite fast a pretence, Congress party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked Chouhan to prepare for his political exile.Speaking to reporters in national capital, Surjewala said,Shivraj Singh Chouhans fast is a drama...it is a sham, he should answer why a case of murder has not been filed in the death of five farmers in Madhya Pradesh.This fast is nothing but a pretence. The Congress is with farmers in their fight for their rights, Surjewala said while alleging that farmers are selling potatoes and onions at throwaway prices in the state. He also blamed BJP for making false promises over providing better prices to farmers for their produce."
222,The crops of wrath,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-crops-of-wrath-demonetisation-4699598/,2017-06-12,Indian Express,"Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrest Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrestWhen demonetisation happened, many, including this writer, thought the decision, taken at the start of rabi plantings in November, would significantly impact farm production. We were proved wrong. Good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. They successfully weathered the DeMo storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments, for labour, purchase of seed, fertiliser and pesticides. Informal credit networks and social capital ensured that, at the end of the day, we had a bumper crop.Where demonetisation did have an impact, however, was in the prices received during harvest: Potatoes in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, fetched below Rs 350 per quintal this February, compared to Rs 600 or more last year. Moreover, while prices in 2016 had crossed Rs 1,100/quintal by mid-May, they are stuck even now at Rs 350-400. The same goes for rabi onions in Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, that traded at an average of Rs 450 per quintal in May, as against Rs 750-800 and Rs 1,200 in the same month of the preceding two years. Farmers, likewise, sold tomatoes at Kolar, Karnataka, in early May for Rs 300-400 per quintal, down from Rs 1,500-1,600 a year ago.When was the last time we saw all three  potatoes, onions and tomatoes  wholesaling at less than Rs 5/kg, and even retail prices within Rs 20/kg? And this, in peak summer! The above fire sales  the evocative term used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its latest bimonthly monetary policy review statement  has been repeated across a range of other crops too: Garlic and methi (fenugreek) seed prices at Mandsaur  the district in Madhya Pradeshs Malwa region thats become synonymous with the ongoing farmer unrest  averaged Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,100-3,200 per quintal in April, whereas these ruled at over Rs 4,100 and Rs 4,700-4,800 respectively during the same time last year. Farmers in Nashik, which has also witnessed large-scale street action, along with the rest of Western Maharashtra, had to dump Sonaka grapes at about Rs 12 per kg in March, having sold the same green seedless variety for Rs 45 or so last year.Even more illustrative is the story of soyabean, a kharif crop that, at harvest time in November, quoted at Rs 2,800-2,900 in Indore  that price has barely moved since then, even as sowing for the new season has commenced. A similar fate has befallen arhar/tur (pigeon-pea), which realised Rs 4,300-4,500 in January-February at Gulbarga, Karnataka.That rate, already below the governments minimum support price of Rs 5,050, has fallen further to Rs 3,700-3,800 levels now. Given a choice, will any farmer plant soyabean or arhar in this kharif season?The idea behind throwing these numbers is to emphasise a fact that should be obvious: Whats going on isnt an ordinary fire sale limited to one or two commodities. This is not an isolated sugar or egg price crash, affecting only the cane grower in Muzaffarnagar and Sangli, or the layer poultry farmer of Namakkal. It is about a generalised fall in prices across agricultural commodities. Weve entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.How? Well, much of the produce trading in India is cash-based and financed through a chain of mandi intermediaries, processors, input dealers and retailers. While difficult to establish, anecdotal reports suggest that this traditional agro-commercial capital was dealt a body blow by demonetisation. The collateral damage from it has been a haemorrhaging of liquidity from the markets. With the trade, which used to previously buy and stock up whenever prices fell, no longer active  it neither has the cash, nor the confidence now  the produce markets are suddenly without an important source of liquidity. True, this speculative capital was also a source of inflation, wherein, say, a 10 per cent production shortfall led to prices zooming 200 per cent. But today, its the opposite: A 10 per cent output increase engenders a 200 per cent price collapse.One does not know how long it would take for formal finance, banks, commodity trading houses or organised retail, to fill the void left by traditional agro-commercial capital whose transactions were largely in cash. Till that happens and liquidity truly returns, the ultimate sufferer is the farmer, evidence of which is visible in mandi prices and restive hinterlands.But even assuming demonetisations effects to be transitory, there is another elephant in the room in the form of inflation targeting. The finance ministry and the RBI, in February, 2015, signed a monetary policy framework agreement, obliging the latter to achieve an annual consumer price index (CPI) inflation target of 4 per cent, subject to a plus/minus 2 per cent band. While such inflation targeting may have been adopted by some 29 other countries, the Indian case is unique because of the sheer weight of food and non-alcoholic beverages in its CPI. At 45.86 per cent, this is way above the corresponding combined share of these items in the official CPIs of the United Kingdom (10.3 per cent), Canada (16.41 per cent) or New Zealand (18.84 per cent).Given the high weightage of agricultural products in its CPI, the success of inflation targeting in India is predicated on what happens to food prices. And since inflation at the retail and not just the wholesale level is whats being targeted, it inherently incentivises policy actions that depress farm prices (fire sales may, after all, not be all that bad a thing for the five wise men and one woman constituting the RBIs monetary policy committee). That could also explain why our policymakers today are naturally predisposed towards imposing controls on stockholding, domestic movement and export of farm goods, alongside allowing duty-free imports, at the slightest hint of a price increase  while doing nothing when produce realisations hit rock bottom.Inflation eventually isnt just a matter of the prices of goods and services going up or down. It is also about whose prices are rising and whose are falling  in other words, winners and losers. In the current deflationary environment, the farmers are the clear losers.harish.damodaran@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
223,Majha farmers revert to Pusa 1509 Basmati,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/majha-farmers-revert-to-pusa-1509-basmati/articleshow/59134664.cms,2017-06-13,The Times Of India,"AMRITSAR: Higher yield and early maturity of Pusa 1509 variety of Basmati has found favour with farmers in Majha once again despite the fact that rice exporters do not prefer it over other available varieties of the aromatic rice.Talking to ToI, former agriculture officer Parmjit Singh Sandhu said, ""The crop is ready for harvest in about just 90 days as compared to Pusa Basmati 1121, which takes 140 days to ripen. Early maturity allows farmers to grow vegetables during rest of the time."" He added that previous issues relating to marketing of Pusa 1509 had been resolved by the government, making it easier for farmers to switch to the long-grained basmati variety.""Pusa 1509 has an average yield of around 24 quintals per acre as compared to Pusa 1121 which yields around 20 quintals per acres,"" said farmer Satnam Singh Ajnala, a farmer leader. He said the purchase rate for Pusa 1509 was Rs 1,500 per quintal as compared to Rs 2,200 of Pusa 1121 last year. ""Though there is a loss of around Rs 8,000 per acre by growing this variety, it is easier for farmers to make up for the loss by growing vegetables over a month and half and make up to Rs 35,000 per acre,"" he said.""This year, there has been a 50 per cent increase in sale of seed for Pusa 1509 variety over other strains of Basmati,"" said Gaurav Mahajan, a seed store owner. He said after early harvest of Pusa 1509, farmers could grow peas, potatoes or fodder and make good money.When contacted, Chief Agriculture Officer (CAO), Amritsar, B S Chhinna said they were yet to conduct a survey to find out the most favoured Basmati variety this year. He said the paddy sowing would start from June 15 and Basmati would be transplanted a month later."

None proved to be plastic rice. It is fake news, Mrinalini Darswal commissioner of the state food safety department told HT.Rumours about plastic rice have been making rounds and spreading like wildfire over the past few days. It all started when customer complained that plastic rice was used to prepare biryani in Hyderabad.The news not only grabbed media headlines but also became viral on social media as wheat and paddy forms the staple diet of Indians.We have been receiving calls from wary customers across Delhi. Such rumours were also spreading across the social media. Earlier this month we received a grievance letter from a person. It was then we decided to go for a random check, said a food safety officer of the department.The samples were checked in the food laboratory of the department of food safety. All the samples complied with the specification under regulation no 2.4.6.5 of the Food Products Standards and Food Additives Regulation Act 2011 which defines the standards of rice in India.Only four samples were found to be misbranded due to labelling violations and one sample of cooked rice was found to be unsafe as it contained some bacteria, said Darswal.Environment right activist Vikrant Tongad who had shot the grievance letter to the food safety department said the panic about plastic rice being imported from China and flooding the markets were making rounds in social media.It was unlikely that plastic rice would be imported to India as it costs much more than normal paddy. Secondly India produces enough paddy and doesnt need to import rice from China. But as news of plastic rice were also surfacing from other countries I decided to inform the food safety department, said Tongad.Sources said that the concept of plastic rice first surfaced around seven years back in China. It was popularly known as the Wuchang Rice Scandal. It was said to be made out of sweet potatoes and synthetic resin moulded into the shape of real rice. In 2016 Nigerian authorities claimed to have seized around 2.5 tons of plastic rice."

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

In all five instances, the families of those who killed themselves said the farmers were under heavy debt - from government institutions and private money lenders. Two of the suicides have happened in Kanpur district, and one each in Mahoba, Banda and Kaushambhi. The government has ordered inquiries into the suicides.The spate of suicides come after the state's BJP government, led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, waived off loans to the tune of Rs 35,000 crores in April. The waiver was part of the BJP's promises in the run-up to the state assembly elections. However, there is confusion among farmers over which loans are covered by the scheme, and which are not.""This government does not have a framework. They did not say whether there would be a limit or a condition to the waiver"", said Samajwadi Party's Basudev Yadav, who was sent by former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to visit the Dwivedi family in Kaushambhi.The state's deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya hit back at the Samajwadi Party.""SP is doing vendetta politics. We are committed towards working for the farmers and the loan was waived in the first cabinet meeting,"" the minister said.At Kaushambhi's Bakhtiyara village, 60-year-old Ram Babu Dwivedi committed suicide on Wednesday morning. The potato farmer recently received a loan recovery notice from a local cooperative. He had accumulated over seven lakh rupees as loan from government banks and crop worth 300 quintal rotted away in his fields.""I used to ask him about the loans but he would always say that he would take care of it,"" said Devendra, Ram Babu's son.Yesterday, a farmer in Kanpur, Shiv Kumar, died at a Kanpur hospital.

His meagre earnings supported his wife, and four young daughters.""In his condition, 60 - 70 thousand rupees was no less than 6-7 lakh rupees,"" said his younger brother Ravi Shankar, also a farmer.Neighbouring Madhya Pradesh has been witnessing violent protests by farmers who are demanding loan waivers and better prices for their crops. The protests abated this week after the government announced some relief this week and paid a compensation of Rs 1 crore to the families of each of the six farmers killed in Mandsaur on June 6. Prohibitory orders have been lifted from Ratlam today - a day after they were lifted from the epicentre of the protests in Mandsaur."
231,Vegetable prices fall by up to 90%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/vegetable-prices-fall-by-up-to-90/article19052003.ece,2017-06-15,The Hindu,"Forty-six-year-old Ramesh Pahuja, a commission agent dealing in potatoes and tomatoes at the Khandsa Subzi Mandi, is worried about his dwindling profit margins due to the sharp decline in prices of vegetables this season.Claiming that the slump in the vegetables market started nearly six months ago when the government announced its demonetisation decision, Mr. Pahuja said that the prices of tomatoes had come down drastically from Rs. 50-55 per kg in June last year to just Rs. 5-6 per kg this season.High supply, low demandWith the drop in prices, our profit margins have nose-dived, it is becoming difficult for us to pay our rent or pay salaries to the workers, said Mr. Pahuja, proprietor of Satguru Trading Company.Involved in the business for over two decades, Mr. Pahuja attributed the sharp fall in prices to the bumper crop, due to good monsoon last year, and the ban on export of vegetables to Pakistan.The arrival of tomatoes in Khandsa has doubled from five tonnes last year to 10 tonnes this year, but the demand is constant and is leading to a sharp fall in prices. Besides, the vegetables are not being exported across the border. The export was allowed for three days this season and prices had suddenly gone up, but it was then closed, said Mr. Pahuja.Devidas, another commission agent, said that the prices of potatoes, onions and lemons had also fallen sharply compared to last year.Potatoes were being sold at Rs. 20 per kg in December last year, but now their prices have nose-dived to Rs. 5-6 per kg. Similarly, onions are now selling for Rs. 7-8 per kg compared to Rs. 10-12 last year. Lemon is selling at Rs. 15 per kg whereas it was Rs. 35-40 per kg last year. The sales have also decreased to half, further taking a toll on our profit margins, said Devidas, proprietor of Sahil Fruits and Vegetables Company.The commission agents, however, said that the farmers had suffered the brunt of the situation.The farmer gets around Rs. 4 per kg for tomatoes. He not able to even recover his cost. The farmers in Jharkhand a few months ago dumped tonnes of tomatoes on the roads after the price fell to just 50 paisa per kg. Same thing happened in Chhattisgarh, said Mr. Pahuja.Food for thoughtVegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are now grown in every part of the country so the supply has increased. But it is not financially viable for the government to buy them at higher rate and sell at lower rate in the market.

232,May wholesale prices soften,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170615/jsp/business/story_156860.jsp,2017-06-15,Telegraph,"New Delhi, June 14: A sharp drop in vegetable prices has pulled down wholesale inflation to a five-month low of 2.17 per cent, prompting India Inc to raise the pitch for a rate cut by the RBI. The wholesale price index (WPI) based inflation was 3.85 per cent in April and (-)0.9 per cent in May 2016. In December, the reading was 2.10 per cent. WPI for the month is based on the new base year of 2011-12, which was revised last month from 2004-05, with an aim to reflect the macroeconomic picture more accurately. ""I think the case for supporting growth is getting stronger and we hope that the RBI will take a relook into its monetary policy stance in the light of these new numbers,"" Pankaj Patel, president of Ficci, said. The slowdown in wholesale inflation comes against the backdrop of retail inflation easing to a multi-year low of 2.18 per cent in May. Data showed that wholesale prices of food articles shrank 2.27 per cent in May on an annual basis. ""The WPI inflation is expected to record a sharp decline to sub-2 per cent in June 2017, led by the base effect and trends in food and commodity prices. The impact of the distribution of rainfall and rise in minimum support prices on the sowing pattern, and the extent to which the prices are revised amid the transition to GST, would be some of the key factors influencing inflation from July 2017,"" Aditi Nayar, principal economist at Icra, said. Pulses and cereals saw a slower growth in prices. The inflation print for vegetables read (-)18.51 per cent. While potatoes saw a deflation of 44.36 per cent, for onions, it came in at 12.86 per cent. The rate of price increase was 4.15 per cent in cereals, down from 6.67 per cent in May last year. Protein-rich pulses turned cheaper in May as prices fell 19.73 per cent. ""Lower IIP growth and continuous decline in both WPI and CPI-based inflation has provided some space for monetary easing. Even with policy easing, the probability of a sharp pick-up in investment demand is very low; the rate cut may help in increased demand for consumer durables affected by demonetisation,"" Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings & Research, said."
233,"Now, Bihar farmers demand loan waiver",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-bihar-farmers-demand-loan-waiver/articleshow/59183739.cms,2017-06-16,The Times Of India,"PATNA: After Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana, the flame of farmers ' protest has entered Bihar as well.As chief minister Nitish Kumar was busy taking feedback from farmers on the agriculture roadmap of his government in an official programme at S K Memorial Hall here on Friday, a large group of farmers staged a dharna at Gardanibagh demanding implementation of minimum support price with 50% additional incentive and wavier of their agriculture loans.In a bid to register their protest, around 100 farmers under the banner of Akhil Bharatiya Rashtrawadi Kisan Ewam Mazdoor Sangahtan spilled milk on the road and threw onion and potato at the dharna venue. Most of these farmers claimed to be followers of Brahmeshwar Singh or Mukhiya, who headed the banned, upper caste militia Ranvir Sena in the state.""The condition of farmers in Bihar is quite bad and soon there would be cases of farmers' suicide in Bihar as well, if the government won't act. We blame Nitish Kumar as well as Narendra Modi for our plight as both are doing nothing to help us financially and in other ways. Both are thugs,"" said Vivek Sharma, state convenor of the farmers' body staging the dharna.The agitating farmers also took a dig at Nitish for organising Kisan Samagam programme at S K Memorial by ignoring their plight. ""Who organises meeting with farmers in AC hall? While we have to sell our farms due to financial crisis, the CM invites select farmers to his programme. Such programmes are just aimed at deceiving the common people and ignoring serious issues,"" said Awadhesh Nandan Sharma , district president of the farmers' outfit.Earlier this week, Nitish had slammed the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre for its failure to resolve the nationwide farmers' protest. ""Farmers are in a bad condition, but the central government is indifferent to them. The government's failure to enforce MSP for farm produces has forced the farmers to protest. The country has been facing an agrarian crisis due to the low price of farm produces,"" Nitish had said on the sidelines of his Lok Samvad programme on Monday.In Friday's protest, the farmers demanded minimum support price of Rs 50 per litre for milk, Rs 100 per kilogram for pulses, Rs 3,000 per quintal for paddy and Rs 4,000 per quintal for wheat.""RJD chief Lalu Prasad never fails to term himself garibo ka neta, but he never supports milkmen, his traditional vote base,"" said Vivek."

Express Photo by A Aggarwal Farmers block the NH-1 (GT Road) at Ambala Cantt Friday. Express Photo by A AggarwalAFTER BLOCKING national highways for two to three hours in Haryana on Friday, farmers have threatened to gherao New Delhi with tractor trolleys if their demands for loan waiver and profitable prices were not met.It may happen that a bigger agitation can be announced. We can go for an indefinite jam of roads, gherao of Delhi with tractor-trolleys and jail bharo agitation, said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Haryana, while addressing hundreds of farmers, who had blocked the National Highway-1, which connects New Delhi with Chandigarh, near Ambala.As part of the call for nationwide agitation on Friday, the farmers blocked national highways in different parts of Haryana apart from blockage of roads at four other places. And, to avoid confrontation with the farmers, police did not stop them from blocking roads, making it a smooth affair for the agitators. The authorities, though, diverted traffic routes to avoid long jams on the national highways.We had coordinated even with the authorities of Patiala, Karnal and Panchkula to divert routes of heavy vehicles far way from Ambala, said Prabhjot Singh, Deputy Commissioner, Ambala, who kept monitoring security arrangements for hours when the farmers were sitting on the national highway. Despite that, there was a near traffic jam in Ambala when traffic was not being allowed on the national highway because of the farmers stir. The farmers also blocked National Highway 71A which connects Panipat-Rohtak near village Rukhi (Sonepat) with another highway, which connects Chandigarh and Hisar, near Barwala town. Haryana DGP BS Sandhu said the agitation was completely peaceful throughout the state.A senior officer said Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was taking feedback about the agitation from the district authorities every five minutes. In support of farmers, former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda held a panchayat at Pipli (Kurukshetra) while INLD held protests at district headquarters in support of the agitating farmers.Farmers, who had reached the protest site in Ambala district on their tractor-trolleys, were perturbed over the manner in which their crops were not purchased at reasonable prices. Harbhajan Singh (52), a farmer from Nalvi village in Kurukshetra, said, We opted for sunflower and potato hoping good prices as the government keeps stressing on crop diversification. But, lack of appropriate arrangement for better procurement dashed our hopes.Explaining in depth, Jogender Singh, an owner of five acres of land at Mamumajra village in Kurukshetra, said, Last year, we had paddy but we were offered Rs 200 per quintal less than the minimum support price for it. Then, we opted for potatoes but we were offered just Rs 1 per kg in the market while its production cost was Rs 7 per kg. Now, the government has announced Rs 3,950 per quintal MSP of sunflower. But, the government says it will buy only 25 per cent of the production of farmers at the rate of MSP. Where can we sell our rest of the crop now?Another sunflower farmer, Rajbir Singh, who has 4.5 acres of land, said, The government is ready to buy only 25 per cent of the sunflower crops at MSP and to sell rest of the crop, the farmers have to depend on traders, who offer only Rs 2,500 per quintal for this crop in the open market.Echoing similar sentiments, farmer Jasbir Singh said, If we sell the sunflower crop at the rate of Rs 2,500 per quintal, then we will be able to meet just our expenditure and there would not be any saving for us.Chaduni said, We will hold a panchayat in Shahbad on Saturday to demand MSP for the entire crop of sunflower.Haryana police, meanwhile, have filed FIRs against hundreds of farmers in connection with the blockage of roads by them in different parts of the state on Friday. The police in Rohtak district have filed two FIRs in connection with the blocking of highways  Rohtak-Panipat and Rohtak-Jind. Rohtak SP Pankaj Nain said 42 farmers have been named from about 120 others in two cases lodged in this connection.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Bhuprendra Rana)More than 4,000 Congress workers were reportedly detained Friday across Gujarat for blocking traffic on national and state highways as part of the rasta roko (road blockade) agitation in support of farmers demands. During the protest, state Congress leaders and workers demanded farm loan waiver, hike in minimum support price, reduction in costs for fertiliser, pesticides, seeds and other agricultural inputs, besides adequate supply of power and water for irrigation.There was no report of violence from anywhere in the state during the agitation. At Amirgarh in Banskantha district, Congress workers and farmers cut trees to block the road. In Deodar, Lakhni, Dhanera and Deesa, farmers blocked the state highway for about two hours by putting stones and burning tyres on the road. In Danta, they dumped potatoes to put obstruction on the roads. In Gandhinagar, Congress workers jammed a road near Gift city.They dumped road building materials to block the road at many places in the state capital. In Porbander, Congress workers obstructed the traffic by burning tyres near Narsinh Tekjri on the national highway. Former state party president Arjun Modhwadia, who led the blockade in Porbander, said that the party workers squatted on the road at several places on the outskirts of the town to block the traffic. Former MP Jagdish Thakore said that the road blockade protest was highly successful in Patan and Aravalli district. State party spokesperson Manish Doshi said that party workers blocked roads all over the state in support of farmers demands. He said BJP governments in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra were anti-farmers.For all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App"
236,Haryana farmers forced to sell potatoes at 20 paisa/kg,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/haryana-farmers-forced-to-sell-potatoes-at-20-paisakg-4709585/,2017-06-18,Indian Express,"(Representational Image) (Representational Image)Haryana farmers have been selling their potatoes for as low as 20 paisa per kg in the grain market of Pipli in Kurukshetra district this year. And if market labour charges are deducted, their net earning is just 9 paisa per kg. This is not just an allegation by farmers but a fact verified by a Market Committee of the Haryana government. Documents accessed by The Indian Express show that Sukhpal Singh, a resident of village Mangoli (Kurukshetra), sold 43.20 quintal potatoes for Rs 900 at grain market at Pipli on May 25.He paid Rs 520 as labour charges in the grain market for cleaning and unloading of the potatoes. The arthiya (commission agent) paid him just Rs 380, which means he earned just 9 paisa per kg, mentioned the document. The commission agent in this case, Ram Kumar Saini, told The Indian Express there could be many cases like of Sukhpal. Sukhpals potatoes were not good in quality. But even the good potatoes were purchased at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg. This time, there was no demand of potatoes from Bihar. Probably, they (Bihar farmers) had cultivated enough potatoes this year, said Saini.A farmer from village Mamumajra in Kurukshetra, Jasbir Singh, said, I also sold my potatoes for Rs 20 paisa per kg. There was no buyer in the market. In fact, it was an outcome of notebandi. The traders had no money. But ultimately the farmers are being forced to bear the brunt of notebandi. I had cultivated potatoes in 40 acres of land. We were forced to sell even the early variety potatoes at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg in December and January. I agree potato produce this time was a little high in comparison to the previous year. But where is the government which keeps saying it will facilitate export of potatoes and other products.Why was there no arrangement to export potatoes to Pakistan, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka? questioned Jasbir Singh.Another farmer from the same village, Jogender Singh, said, The potatoes are bought at throwaway prices from farmers. We fail to understand how the same potatoes are sold by rehriwalas to the people in urban areas at the rate of Rs 15 per kg. The cultivation of potatoes proved a business of huge loss this year for farmers as the average production cost of potatoes was Rs 7 per kg, he said. Bhartiya Kisan Unions Haryana unit president Gurnam Singh Chaduni said, The farmers blocked national highways on Friday to demand profitable prices of their crops. Now, we will discuss the next strategy on June 19.Former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who along with other Congress MLAs met Haryana Governor to seek his intervention to solve problems of farmers on Saturday, said, This is an anti-farmer government. BJP leaders who used to stage half-naked protests to demand implementation of recommendations of Swaminathan Commission report to ensure 50% profit on the cost input of crops are now MLAs and ministers in the Haryana government. But now they have nothing to do with the farmers.However, Haryana Finance Minister Captain Abhimanyu said, Hooda, who is now protesting (for) the report of Swaminathan Commission, should tell the people of the state what he had done regarding this report. He has forgotten how, apart from forced acquisition of the land of farmers, they were offered cheques for Rs 2 or Rs 3 as compensation for losses due to crop damage during his regime, which just served to rub salt into their wounds. Abhimanyu said the present government was taking consistent action on the report of the Swaminathan Commission report, which had been appreciated by Chairman of the Commission, Prof. M S Swaminathan himself.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
237,Across the Aisle: Farm sector on the boil,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/across-the-aisle-farmers-agitations-agriculture-farm-sector-on-the-boil-4709331/,2017-06-18,Indian Express,"Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat? Wait and see.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
238,Drought  low yield drive vegetable prices up by 40%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drought-low-yield-drive-vegetable-prices-up-by-40/article19097340.ece,2017-06-18,The Hindu,"Drought across the State and low yield in neighbouring districts of Chennai have hit the supply of vegetables to the citys wholesale market at Koyambedu. The prices of several vegetables have spiralled this month, as a result. Even a bunch of mint and coriander leaves costs Rs. 40 due to the severe water crisis in places in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka where the plants are grown.Traders at the Koyambedu market said the market now receives only up to 250 truck loads of vegetables daily compared to the usual 350-400 trucks. S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association, said several vegetables are now at least 40% costlier than last month. Usually, the prices of vegetables that escalate during summer begin to drop from mid-June. But, as the drought situation continues across the State and also in neighbouring States, vegetables may remain expensive till July, he said.Onion, tomato and potato are the only vegetables that are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 25 per kg. Cabbage and snake gourd are also being preferred more by some customers as they are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kg in the wholesale market. Several customers have cut down on their volume of purchase. Beans and carrots are expensive.Low yieldP.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flower Merchants Welfare Association, said: Even the locally grown green chillies and brinjals are priced high this month as the yield is less across the State. Vegetable prices have been increasing for three months. But Ramzan has helped to keep sales up, he said."
239,Adulteration provides food for thought,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/adulteration-provides-food-for-thought/article19097316.ece,2017-06-18,The Hindu,"Last week, the city witnessed a video of MTC staff purporting to show plastic rice being served in their canteen. The clip, showing men in khaki bouncing small balls of rice off the walls and tables at the canteen of the Ayanavaram bus depot, spread like wildfire on social media. The footage also came close on the heels of information shared on WhatsApp regarding the seizure of alleged plastic rice in other parts of the country.In a State where its own Dairy Development Minister came out with the shocking allegation that private milk producers were adding chemicals to their products, similar claims pertaining to adulteration of rice with plastic seemed ever more probable. So, is there really plastic in rice and sugar, and are there chemicals in milk? Could eggs be made of plastic? Was there any truth to the messages circulating on WhatsApp or were they merely old wives tales that no one in the position of authority was prepared to debunk?As one scare story after another finds prominence through social media platforms, questions are asked, and sometimes answered, with knee-jerk reactions. As adulteration has long remained a tool of choice for unscrupulous traders looking to make a quick buck, only the adulterants have varied with time. Consumer activists point to the need for a proper system capable of answering these questions in a scientific manner, and wherever necessary, allaying rumours and suspicions about food safety that arise periodically among the public.The term plastic rice came into being after a scandal was exposed in China in 2010, in which pellets were made by mixing sweet potato powder with poor quality rice. A resin was found to have been used for the bonding. But this was banned.But in India, although there have been several complaints and allegations of rice being mixed with plastic, tests conducted on so-called plastic rice have conclusively proved that there had been no plastic element in such rice samples, said A. C. Mohan, secretary, Federation of Tamil Nadu Rice Mill Owners and Paddy-Rice Dealers Associations.As regards the clips showing rice balls being bounced off the walls, Mr. Mohan said that gelatine, which is found naturally in rice, could make it bouncy if rolled into balls. Boiled rice has more of gelatine, which retains more of its germinal matter. While raw rice varieties including Basmati are not sticky, varieties grown in Tamil Nadu such as Ponni , ADT 36 and Adhisiya Ponni are more sticky than the usual boiled rice. Rubber samba and Maappilai samba are rare varieties that have even more starch and gelatin and are suitable to make kall dosai . These varieties take longer to grow (in some cases six months) and are more healthy, he explained.Federation president D. Thulasingam said that rice merchants were also consumers in the first place, and that they will not sell such adulterated products. Various government agencies had taken samples and conducted tests but so far, no plastic has been found in rice anywhere in the country. Plastic cannot be cooked, it will only melt in the heat. Rice will sink in water, whereas plastic will float. Any home-maker can differentiate between boiled and raw rice by mere feel, smell and sight, he said.It also does not make economic sense to mix plastic with rice, he said. Plastic pellets available in the market are costlier than rice. A kilo of plastic costs anywhere between Rs. 80 and Rs. 100, whereas rice costs Rs. 30-Rs. 60 a kilo. How can someone use a costlier item to make something cheaper? Also, we have at least six months worth of stocks of rice and there is no need for importing rice, let alone plastic rice, Mr. Thulasingam added.R. Kathiravan, designated officer, Food Safety department, Chennai, said that 20 samples of rice were collected and sent for analysis. While 16 of them were sent to the food analysis lab at the King Institute campus in Chennai, four samples were sent to a lab in Thanjavur . Of the 15 results received till date, there has been no evidence of any plastic content in the rice in Chennai, he said.Chemicals in milkUntil a few days ago, milk vendors too had to ward off such queries from consumers after State Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji levelled allegations against certain private milk brands, saying they were adding chemicals to milk.In the wake of the controversy, district administrations stepped in at places such as Madurai and Coimbatore and tested milk samples submitted by the residents. In Madurai, the electronic milk adulteration tests showed that out of 217 samples taken on three different dates in the city and two other locations in the suburbs, 25 samples were found to be of sub-standard quality, while another was found to be unsafe for consumption. District Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that awareness was high among rural people as well.Maheswari of Jawahar Nagar, Thirumangalam, in Madurai, said she purchased milk from a vendor who supplied it in quantities of 100 ml and 150 ml. Since it was not branded, we decided to provide a sample of it for testing and found that it was safe to consume, she added.Madurai-based consumer activist Andrews pointed out that the government officials carried out tests only after the Minister for Dairy Development raised the issue of adulteration, adding that such tests should be conducted on a regular basis. Not just milk, the officials should also carry out periodic tests on all items including oil and rice as there have been complaints of sub-standard goods coming in, he added.Adulteration of milk is being monitored on a monthly basis, said a senior Food Safety department official. Of the samples we collected, only one from Madurai was found to be unsafe, as soap oil had been mixed with it. With regard to the other samples, some were found to be sub-standard  containing water, for instance, in milk, but they were not unsafe in terms of health, he said. While sub-standard milk can attract a penalty, unsafe milk can lead to a case in court, a fine and imprisonment, he noted.A milk industry expert said that so far, in samples lifted by the Food Safety department, only samples of unpackaged milk have been found to contain traces of detergent or soap oil.The soap element may have even been due to improper cleansing of utensils at homes. Private milk producers know that their customers are brand-conscious and loyal to their brands due to certain factors, the most important being quality. At times, when it comes to favoured brands, consumers wont even bother about the cost. Companies will not compromise on quality and end up losing the loyalty of such consumers, he said.However, the Milk Commissionerate has stopped taking samples of milk ever since the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) stepped in and began collecting samples.Plastic eggs scareIn the wake of the recent plastic eggs scare, acting on a State-wide directive and complaints from consumers, checks were conducted on eggs in Coimbatore district. All of the 161 samples collected in April this year were found to be safe. Samples of popular White Leghorn were tested at the government laboratory in Madurai, said O.L.S. Vijay, designated officer, FSSAI, Coimbatore.Adulteration not newWith plastics and chemicals prevalent in pretty much everything we use, the adulteration scare is here to stay. In the 1980s food adulteration was something that people had just begun hearing about  it used to mean stones in rice, water in milk, sawdust in tea and brick powder in chilli powder. But all that is pass now.Adulteration has taken on a new avatar. It now comes in the form of non-permitted colours being added to snacks like bhajji and pakoda sold on the roadsides, maida bleached with chemicals, oil-soluble red colour added to chilli powder and cheap palm oil mixed with other cooking oils to reduce the price, says G. Santhanarajan of the Consumer Association of India (CAI).Even the word adulteration is not to be found in the Food Safety and Standards Act. The Act talks about safe foods, sub-standard and unsafe foods. You can simply pay a fine and get off the hook unless the product is deemed unsafe. We now have to be afraid of plastics, especially those that come in the form of food packaging. Packing hot food items in plastic bags is bad for health as the heat causes the plastic to react. Everything from oil to water to pulses that we buy comes in plastic packs. But since nobody has time for anything, people dont even bother to carry their own bags to department stores to avoid plastic bags, he rued.Enforcement failureAfter the Food Safety and Standards Act came into force, though a separate set-up came into being to check food standards, the very same officials of various local bodies have been implementing the norms. Consumer activists feel that the department is failing at enforcement.Nirmala Desikan, chairman and managing trustee, CAI, said that the new Act was a detailed and more comprehensive one than the one that it replaced. There are so many things that are adulterated, but the problem is that they (officials) are not strong enough in implementing the rules. We also dont know how many complaints it (Food Safety department) receives or how many are dealt with. The department is not transparent, she said.Food Safety officials have refused to provide the exact data on adulteration of milk in the State to The Hindu . Only rough figures of complaints and samples collected were provided. Each laboratory gets around 500 samples a month. Just 100 samples are collected from milk products, said a source.Many residents have registered complaints with the Food Safety department through its WhatsApp number 9444042322. We will increase random sampling to study the trends. The analysis is done in three days. Samples are collected within 24 hours of receipt of complaints, said an official.But activist T. Sadagopan is far less optimistic. The very few checks that are done hardy matter since very few people are penalised. And those who adulterate will continue to do so. For the consumer, this would only mean unchecked adulteration leading to an adverse impact on their health.( With inputs from Aloysius Xavier Lopez and Zubeda Hamid in Chennai, L. Srikrishna in Madurai and Wilson Thomas in Coimbatore)Food samples are collected within 24 hours of receipt of complaints.Food safety officialThe problem is that they (officials) are not strong enough in implementing the rulesNirmala DesikanConsumer Association of India"

The violent agitation that erupted in the Malwa belt of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the death of five farmers in police firing, has now spread to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. The demand for farm loan waiver, accompanied by higher crop prices, is now gaining momentum.More than 3.18 lakh farmers have committed suicide in the past 21 years. Every 41 minutes a farmer commits suicide in the country. While I agree that farmer suicides are a symptom of a bigger malaise that afflicts agriculture, policymakers have failed to take the massive death toll as a sign of terrible economic depravity that plagued the rural landscape. How long could we expect farmers to take the hit silently? It had to happen one day, and no one knew what will trigger it.For nearly three decades, more so after the economic reforms were ushered in, agriculture has been a victim of neglect and apathy. Following the World Banks prescription of moving 400 million people from the rural to the urban areas by the year 2015, successive governments deliberately created conditions to turn farming unviable, thereby forcing an increasing number of farmers to abandon agriculture and migrate to cities. To keep food inflation under control, farmers have been routinely paid less, not even to cover the cost of production, thereby driving them against the wall.With each passing year, the crisis worsened. The 2016 Economic Survey tells us that the average annual income of a farming family in 17 states, roughly half the country, is a mere Rs 20,000 or less than Rs 1,700 a month. Such a dismal income, merely enough for subsistence, was the outcome of economic policies over the years. I shudder to think how these farming families must be surviving all these years. After all, it is not even possible to rear a cow in less than Rs 1,700 a month.But I doubt if such details mean anything to mainline economists and policymakers. With the markets crashing after every harvest, and with the government reluctant to save farmers by ensuring that they get at least the Minimum Support Price (MSP), farmers are pushed deeper and deeper into a never-ending cycle of debt. Even the MSP is often less than the cost of production. In Maharashtra, the production cost of tur dal has been worked out at Rs 6,240 per quintal. The MSP was Rs 5,050 per quintal, but the price at which farmers were able to sell tur, and that too after waiting for nearly a week in the mandis, was between Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,200 per quintal.Take another case. A farmer in Haryana toils hard for three months, putting all his labour to reap a bountiful harvest of potato only to find the prices crashing, thereby forcing him to sell 40 quintals of potato for just 9 paise a kg. The shock often turns fatal. But the fact remains that the government has rarely come to his rescue. Compare this with the fall in stock markets, and the finance minister promises to monitor the crisis on an hourly basis, holding a press conference to assuage the investors. Have we ever seen the finance minister or the agriculture minister monitoring the deplorable condition when farm prices crash?The poor farmer has been left to live in indebtedness, which keeps multiplying with every passing year. The crisis is compounded by the denial of a rightful income to farmers for their produce. To keep food inflation under control, it is the farmers who have paid the price. In reality, it is the farmers who have been subsidising the nation all these years. Successive governments have therefore deliberately kept agriculture impoverished. An estimated 58% of the farmers go to bed hungry every night.After Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced a farm loan waiver worth Rs 36,359 crore, which will benefit 92 lakh small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra announced a loan waiver worth Rs 30,500 crore. Punjab is expected to take over at least Rs 30,000 crore of the bad loans. Though I am not in favour of loan waivers but in a deplorable situation that agriculture has been pushed into, a waiver is a short-term relief.It is an emergency measure to bail out millions of small and marginal farmers in distress. IndiaSpend estimates a total of Rs 3.1 lakh crore of farm loan that needs to be waived. This is still far less than the Rs 4 lakh crore bailout package that the telecom industry alone is seeking. Another Rs 1.7 lakh crore of bad debt is what the steel industry hopes will be written off.Holistic approachLoan waiver must be followed by policies that ensure loans dont pile up again. A tinkering here and there is not going to address the crisis. It needs a holistic approach and a paradigm shift in economic thinking.To begin with:The effort should be to make farming economically viable.The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, which works out the MSP for crops, should be directed to factor in four allowances being paid to farmers  house allowance, medical allowance, educational allowance and travel allowance. So far, MSP only covers the cost of production. Government employees get a total of 108 allowances.Since MSP benefits only 6% of the farmers, it needs to be understood that the demand for providing 50% profit over MSP will benefit only these 6% farmers. For the remaining, who are dependent on the exploitative markets, the need is to set up a National Farmers Income Commission, with the mandate to provide a minimum assured monthly income package of Rs 18,000 per farmer family.Public sector investments must come in urgently for constructing Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee mandis and also for storage godowns. At present, there are only 7,700 APMC mandis. What India needs is 42,000 mandis for every 5 km radius. And like in Brazil, where it is mandatory for a market yard to procure anything a farmer brings, APMC mandis should be equipped to do the same.(The writer is a commentator on issues relating to farmers and agriculture)"
241,UP farmers in dilemma due to drop in price of potatoes,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-farmers-in-dilemma-due-to-drop-in-price-of-potatoes/articleshow/59222686.cms,2017-06-19,The Times Of India,"AGRA: All cold storages in Agra, one of the biggest potato producing regions of UP , are currently filled with potatoes . Farmers say there is no point selling the produce as they are not even able to get back their investment due to the low price. It is estimated that around 6 crore sacks of 50 kg each, totaling 30 lakh ton, are stored in Agra region alone. State horticulture department has now appealed to farmers not to hoard the tuber. Recently government determined minimum support price for procurement of potato at the rate of Rs 487 per quintal, but farmers said it is too low to benefit them.There are around 240 cold storage units in Agra. All of them are completely filled with potatoes, with farmers refusing to take them out till the prices become better.According to horticulture department officials, In August the potato crop of Karnataka will hit the market. This may result in a sudden fall in the price of the stored potatoes. Therefore farmers in the state have been advised to continue selling the stored produce to avoid even worse losses.Potato is a major crop in the district, cultivated in around 72,000 hectares of land. Agra division, which includes Agra, Firozabad, Mathura and Mainpuri, is one of the major producers of the tuber, which is supplied to states including Maharashtra, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.District horticulture officer Anita Singh said, ""The current potato prices are much lower than in previous years. In the near future, there is no significant scope for increase in potato prices. To avoid major losses, farmers should slowly continue to sell their produce. Depending on quality, the present market rate of potato is Rs 300 to 600 per quintal whereas it should be between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 per quintal.""According to department officials, increased in production of potato and a stop on supply to Pakistan and some other neigbouring countries is one of the reasons behind the drop in prices.Rakesh Goyal, secretary of Agra Cold Storage Association said, ""Compared to previous years, this time around 12% more potato came for storage. But due to low prices, few farmers are taking away their produce.""According to market experts, till June 20 around 25% of the produce should have been sold. But business has witnessed fall of 12%.Khandoli farmer Sharvan Singh said, ""Government has turned farmers into a joke. The minimum support price is not reasonable at all. It doesn't even pay for the investment we made in the crop.""Agra Potato Business Association general secretary Aamir Bhai said, ""Ever since demonetization, business has continued to be derailed. Farmers will be forced to throw their produce on the roads, but the government does not seem to be concerned.""Farmer Gyan Singh Sikarwar said, ""Next year I will not produce potato at any cost. I am thinking of sowing some other crop but that needs money too. I already have a pending loan of Rs 5,000 and banks have told us we will not get further loan till the previous ones are waived by the government."""

The booking cost for a wedding at the Rock Garden is Rs 70,000, out of which Rs 10,000 is refundable.The Chandigarh administration has imposed a ban on all wedding events at the Rock Garden.Earlier, wedding occasions were permitted at the third phase of the garden. The decision has been taken in view of the wedding functions creating a mess at the Rock Garden and also posing a threat to the heritage. However, the decision will be applicable for those who have already booked the venue for wedding.Home secretary Anurag Aggarwal told the Chandigarh Newsline:  When a wedding event is organised, the preparations are not done in one or two hours. Tents are erected in the morning and caterers would prepare food right in the middle of the area. One can witness sights like potatoes being peeled at the heritage site.The home secretary also said even tourists faced problems because of the weddings as the area would remain closed for them during such occasions.There are tourists who would come from far off places to visit the Rock Garden. But at many times, they were unable to visit the third phase of the garden because it would be closed until the wedding is over. These orders will not to those who have booked the venue already and the events are lined up for the next two months. But, we are refusing new bookings now, said the home secretary.The administration received complaints that garbage, especially green waste, was not being cleaned after a wedding function and would give a bad look to the garden.The booking cost for a wedding at the Rock Garden is Rs 70,000, out of which Rs 10,000 is refundable.This decision, however, may impact the revenue collection of the Rock Garden Society as there are several bookings ahead of the wedding season.Nek Chands son Anuj Saini said: Though this decision may have an adverse effect on the revenue collection because this was the main source of earning for the Rock Garden Society, it is good for cleanliness and upkeep of the garden as well because garbage would remain stashed for days and it would raise a stink.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

PTI Photo Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village Lodh in Mandsaur district. PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The farmers of main crops such as rice, turmeric, millets, bajra and all horticulture crops could manage only 50 % of their regular production this season. This has affected the arrival of vegetables to the farmers shandies and other markets in the district.Due to the steep fall in the arrival, the prices of vegetables have shot up by about 30 % in the shandies, according to official sources.Small onionThe price of small onion remained as high as Rs. 100 per kg in the shandies and also in the open markets.The price of tomato that stood at Rs. 15 last week, rose to Rs. 22 per kg on Friday in the shandies; the price of carrot has gone up to Rs. 72 from Rs. 60 last week.Similarly the price of beans stood at Rs. 70 per kg; brinjal stood at Rs. 36 per kg; ladies finger Rs. 30; chillies Rs. 46; potato Rs. 24; raddish Rs. 25; beans Rs. 70; snake gourd Rs. 28; flat beans Rs. 50; beetroot Rs. 40, and cabbage Rs. 28.However, the price of big onion has registered a downward trend.

Aiyar was speaking at a symposium organised by the Telangana Congress on Indian Agriculture  Contribution of Smt Indira Gandhi and a review of present scenario as part of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhis birth centenary celebrations.The minimum support price (MSP) for farmers this year has come down compared to last year, Aiyar claimed. Sixty per cent of Indias population is in agriculture. What is their condition? I will tell you the condition. Indiraji started Minimum Support Price.That means, you (farmer) should get more than this. If that is not available, we will support you. Arhar  MSP is Rs 5,050 per quintal. It is being sold at Rs 2,700, he said. Giving out figures, he claimed that other crops like garlic, onion, potato are also being sold at a price less than last years price.The input costs in agriculture have increased substantially thus offsetting any rise in price for the produce, he said. They say we will get (farmers) income doubled. How will you double? This helpless man goes to market and sees that his expenditure is rising. Somebody told me that there is a 700 per cent rise in expenditure of inputs compared to 1991, Aiyar said.Recalling that Rajiv Gandhi, when he was Prime Minister in the 1980s, personally visited villages during a crisis in agriculture, he alleged that the present government spoke only rhetoric.Hailing the leadership of Indira Gandhi in improving agriculture in the country, the Congress leader said she was instrumental in the success of Green Revolution. C Subramaniam (Agriculture Minister), MS Swaminathan (scientist) and Sivaraman (bureaucrat) made stellar contributions to green revolution then, but incumbent Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh suggested doing Yoga as a way to address distress in agriculture, he said.Under the present NDA regime, situation in Kashmir worsened and Indias relations with neighbouring countries like Pakistan, China, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have suffered, Aiyar claimed.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This is the second type of assistance announced by the state government. The government had earlier announced a transport subsidy for potato farmers Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, while speaking to reporters, said that the state government has implemented a new scheme and has allocated Rs 100 crore to provide assistance of Rs 1 per kg and Rs 50 per 50-kg gunny bag to farmers growing potatoes or onions.In Gujarat, the total potato produce is about 39 lakh metric tons and that of onions is about 10 lakh metric tons. Patel said that a committee headed by him had been formed to assist farmers growing potato and onion. The committee also has the agriculture minister Chiman Sapariya, health minister Shankar Chaudhary, minister of state for agriculture Vallabh Vaghasiya and irrigation minister Nanu Vanani.Patel said the committee decided that the government should also provide assistance to farmers who have restored their potato and onion produce in cold storages. Apart from this, the farmer will get Rs 1 per kg for exporting the produce from the state.Officials said that if a farmer sells 300 quintals of the crop in Gujarat he will get Rs 30,000 as subsidy. If he sells the same amount outside Gujarat, he will get an additional export subsidy of Rs 30,000.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association, said, ""This subsidy will be come as a major relief for farmers who decided to stock their crop for lack of a good price. This subsidy will help farmers to at least make good their storage cost.Sources said that the subside was announced keeping in view the election scheduled for later this year. Many farmers who had failed to get remunerative prices for their crops had earlier this month thrown their produce on the streets."
248,"Agri sector seeking new vigour, fresh leadership",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/618481/agri-sector-seeking-vigour-fresh.html,2017-06-21,Deccan Herald,"Agri sector seeking new vigour, fresh leadershipDH News Service Jun 21 2017, 2:14 ISTIn January-February, as the election campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were picking up steam, Home Minister Rajnath Singh first broached the topic of farm loan waiver if the BJP came to power. Little had he thought that the issue would gather momentum just five months down the line and force the Narendra Modi government to consider loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.In a way, the demands for farm loan waiver could be BJPs own doing. Maharasthra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had been steadfast in his opposition to a loan waiver, admitted that he was forced to announce writing off debts of small and marginal farmers due to immense pressure from the farmers whose expectations had risen manifold following similar moves by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The Congress had already raised the pitch for farm loan waiver with vice president Rahul Gandhi undertaking a month-long kisan yatra across Uttar Pradesh in September last year. Though the yatra did not benefit the Congress politically, it did raise expectations of the farmers. The BJP too responded by mentioning farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his election rallies, went to the extent of saying that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will take a decision on farm loan waiver in its first cabinet meeting. The pressure on the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing the loan waiver was telling as he kept delaying the meeting of the cabinet that usually takes place within hours of the new government assuming office. The council of ministers met a couple of times informally as bureaucrats put together proposal for the loan write off for the cabinet to consider in its first meeting.The announcement by the Uttar Pradesh government led to demands for a farm loan waiver from other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu among others. Maharashtra bowed to the demands from farmers and declared a farm loan waiver for needy farmers. The state government put stringent conditions to exclude well-off farmers from the loan waiver scheme to limit its expenditure.As soon as Maharashtra announced its farm loan waiver, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that the state government will have to fund the initiative from its own resources and not expect any bailout by the Centre. The Punjab government became the third state to announce a farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers on June 19, a promise made by the Congress during the poll campaign in the state. In a bid for political one-upmanship, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh  double than what has been offered by UP and Maharashtra.At the heart of the crisis is absence of remunerative prices for farm produce. In simpler terms, a person dependent only on agriculture as a means of livelihood finds it difficult to make both ends meet as he does not earn enough. As prices of pulses, fruits and vegetables shot up during the past two years due to drought, the government had put in place stringent curbs on exports and stockholding by traders. The same were not eased after a spell of good monsoon led to bumper production.The glut of pulses and onions saw farmers making a beeline to market yards to sell their produce leading to a sharp reduction in procurement prices. In Maharashtra, stagnant milk prices had irked farmers who threw milk on the roads instead of selling it to dairies. In Uttar Pradesh, potato growers threw their produce on roads as wholesale prices dipped on account of better production. Similar was the case with onion growers in Madhya Pradesh.The simmering discontent among farmers in Madhya Pradesh led to protests in Mandsaur where six farmers were killed in police firing on June 6. Things took a political turn as leaders made a beeline to Mandsaur to express solidarity with farmers.Delicate issueIn both Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the governments hastily reached out to a section of favourable farmer leaders, agreed to some of their demands and called off the strike. Such handling of a delicate issue further angered the farmers who looked towards leaders such as Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakkaji in Madhya Pradesh and Raju Shetti in Maharashtra to take their struggle to a logical conclusion.While Sharma heads the breakaway faction of the RSS-backed Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Shetti leads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra. Sharma was thrown out of the BKS following his frequent run-ins with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shetti, a Lok Sabha member from Hatkanangale near Kolhapur, is part of the NDA but is increasingly disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modis farm policies.Shetti believes that Modi has lost the script when it came to tackling the agrarian distress as the government, instead of addressing pressing issues such as remunerative prices, was busy pursuing soil health cards. His consistent demand  Modi should fulfil the poll promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan Committee Report that has recommended a 50% margin over the cost of cultivation incurred by the farmers.Farmers were already operating on thin margins, which have dipped even further over the last three years. The poll promise on MSP has remained just that  a promise, with neither the agriculture minister nor the prime minister making any reference to it. The much-touted agri-market reforms too have floundered and so has the flagship programme to provide irrigation facilities to every farm. As many as 23 of the 99 delayed irrigation projects were to be completed by March 2017. The government has missed the deadline.On the political front, the strain on the NDA is showing. Modi had run a tight ship since coming to power in 2014, but allies such as Shiv Sena and Shettis Swabhiman Paksha have been growing restless and have raised a banner of revolt. The agriculture sector is desperately seeking new vigour and fresh leadership to pull it out of the crisis."

At 70, he is old and frail. He speaks, but is not easy to always comprehend. He walks slowly. But it is not just about himself that he is anxious. He is more concerned about the well-being of his family comprising three sons, their wives and 10 grand children.If one person falls sick, we are in trouble. There is no money, says Lal, a farmer in Barabankis Tindwani village. Though just 20 kilometres from Lucknow, if you go by the lack of infrastructure and housing, the state of roads and power, the village could be anywhere in the remote interiors of UP.Lal has a loan of Rs 70,000, taken in 2015, and displays his Kisan Credit Card. He is also a potential beneficiary of the UP governments loan waiver. Even as he waits to see whether his loan will indeed get written off as assured by Yogi Adityanath, the states new chief minister, he is already thinking of the next loan that he will likely be forced to take.The fact that he may have to take another loan underlines the limitations of a loan waiver: it at best can be a temporary relief and is not a solution to the problem of low income farmers plagued by recurrent losses.The economics of investmentLal, for example, has 6 bighas, an acre and a half, of land. The single-most important challenge for him, every season, is finding the resources to invest.Take the economics of potato farming.For an acre of land, Lal - like other potato farmers in Tindwani and elsewhere - has to first buy 20 sacks of seeds, with each sack containing 50 kg. Each kg costs around Rs 24. And so the total cost for seeds is Rs 24,000.He then has to buy fertilisers of different kinds - a 5 kilo pack of zinc sulphate for Rs 300, two packs of urea for Rs 330 each, and five sacks of DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) for Rs 1150 each. The total cost of fertilisers comes to Rs 6710.Lal then has to till and level the land, for which he hires a tractor for Rs 500 per hour. Ten times, for two hours each, the tractor works on preparing the soil and land. Lal shells out another Rs 10,000 for it.He then sows the seeds, for which he has to hire the tractor again, which costs him Rs 2000.The farmers of Tindwani depend on pumps, run on diesel, for irrigation. Engines (which includes diesel rates) can be rented at  150 per hour; every acre requires at least four hours of irrigation; and it has to be irrigated seven times. The total cost for Lal on this head works out to Rs 4200.The next step is the use of pesticides. Along with labour, which can be hired at Rs 250 per day, the costs of this would come to Rs 1500.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?The final step in the cycle is harvesting. A tractor is hired, at Rs 2000 per acre. Ten labourers are hired for the day, which costs Rs 2500. And 250 sacks have to be bought, at Rs 20 each. Together, the entire harvesting exercise costs about Rs 9500.But the cycle is not yet complete, for the farmers have to now transport and store their produce. Each sack is now packed in with 50 kgs of potato. The total produce from an acre, if all goes well, for Lal is about 125 quintals. The total cost of transporting and storing is close to Rs 30,000.And so what constitutes for Lal his basic investment, in one crop cycle, for an acre of land, from the stage of seeds to storing the produce, is approximately Rs 87,910. With miscellaneous costs, this would go up to around Rs 90,000.Potato farmer Kishan at his field in Bandi ka Purva village in Barabanki. (Deepak Gupta/HT Photo)The lose-lose ventureAnd then how much does Lal - or any other farmer of his kind - earn?Till Yogi government came to power in March in UP, there was no Minimum Support Price for potato. In the last season, prices had fluctuated. Local Tindwani farmers told HT that it varied between Rs 120 per sack of 50 kgs to Rs 750 per sack. On an average, this would mean about Rs 4.85 per kg of potato. At 125 quintals, this would mean a return of Rs 60, 625 for an acre of potato produce.But it was erratic. Sometimes, we just left our produce at the storage because it cost more to pay them storage fees than what we would have recovered. So we got no money, says Lal.To offset this problem of wild fluctuation in prices, the Yogi government has introduced an MSP of Rs 487 per quintal. But even if all his produce was acquired at this rate, it would give a farmer like Lal for an acre of his produce Rs 60,875.But remember his investment. It is close to Rs 90,000. And so every acre of potato he cultivates, Lal is actually losing Rs 30,000.The vicious cycleIt is because of this gross mismatch between investment and income that farmers such as Lal end up taking loans. They do not have money for the seeds, the fertilisers, the irrigation, the pesticides, the sowing, the harvesting, the transport and storage because they have actually lost money.Weddings in the family and emergencies like illnesses force them to sell part of their land holdings. Novembers demonetisation did not help. It left even lesser money for investment and so the crop produce for some of the potato farmers of Tindwani went down.The Yogi governments decision to waive off loans up to Rs 1 lakh, for small and marginal farmers with less than a hectare of land, may benefit Lal. But it wont solve his problem.Where would he get the money to make a fresh investment? I will take a loan again. What else can I do?Why did he then cultivate potatoes in the first place?Lal says he has no other option. What else can we do? This is what my family has always done. This is all we know. At least, it gets us some vegetables for the home. Lal says sending his sons out to work is not a solution: they were unskilled and would get Rs 250 as labour charges for a day, which they could get in the village too. At least we are together.It is this underlying driver of despair - limited cash reservoir to make investments, losses on produce because of low price, and thus a further push into deprivation - which is causing despair. The UP governments decision to waive off loans has triggered a nation-wide demand for the same, but Lal knows it is only a matter of time before he is back, standing in the queue for another loan.This is Part 3 of our series, #BeingAFarmerNow. Part 1 focused on the new age farmers of Madhya Pradesh while Part 2 examined how big-ticket projects cheat farmers out of their land."

Food costs around 30% more in AC restaurants.Now that AC restaurants will have 18% GST , even those seated in non-AC sections, which is common among 60% restaurants in Mumbai region, will also have to pay 18%, hoteliers said on Wednesday.Taxation on tentative average pricing in city restaurants in the GST regime suggests that average Mumbaikars eating in non-AC sections will have to pay a lot, leaving not much of a difference in pricing between them and those in AC restaurants.The hotel industry is angry over basic differentiation being made between AC and non-AC, arguing that AC is a necessity and not a luxury in Mumbai, as even local trains are going AC. GST is applicable only on food, and not liquor.Adarsh Shetty, president of Ahar, an association of over 8,000 restaurants in Mumbai, want a uniform 12% tax on all restaurants/bars to avoid disparity. In non-AC restaurants only, the benefit of 12% GST will be passed on, but there are only 20% such restaurants.""Manmohan Singh, as Union finance minister, had announced in his budget speech withdrawal of hotel expenditure tax, citing that in a city like Mumbai, AC was a necessity due to humid conditions. We have moved back in time now even after almost 25 years of development, when Metros are coming up all over the country with AC comfort,"" said Adarsh.""The same facility is not considered a luxury in other businesses, such as pharmacy. This is a legacy of the past wherein the government, unable to define restaurant sales as a service, surreptitiously decide to levy a service tax on AC restaurants,"" said another hotelier and former Ahar secretary Sukesh Shetty.Sukesh said a uniform 12% will avoid complications and make compliance easier. He said an additional 6% tax would be a pinch on commoners, who avoid AC sections. Adarsh said in most restaurants, non-AC sections have more seats.'Chakna to take a hit'Chakna' (snacks) during liquor consumption will cost you more. The GST Council announced a 12% rate for Indian traditional namkeen, savories, farsan, potato chips and banana chips. The rate should be reduced to 5% to maintain uniformity with the rate for sweets, the Snack Food Association of Maharashtra has demanded. The rate for namkeen is double the present tax but industry hardly receives any input credit as its raw materials are agro-based. There is no tax on raw materials like potato, banana, maida, besan, salt and pulses. There is only a marginal tax on masala. Namkeen and sweets are sold from the same shop and are inter-related products for the common man. With 12% GST, the effective prices of all products will increase by 6-8%, the association said."

It has also taken up with the Union government to increase procurement of sunflower seeds from 25% to 50% of the state's produce.The information was shared by Haryana agriculture minister Om Prakash Dhankar on Thursday while adding that the state government was implementing Swaminathan commission's recommendations in a step-wise manner by making agriculture risk free for farmers, with zero-interest loans and crop diversification.Replying to a question that Haryana farmers are forced to sell potatoes for even 20 paisa per kg, Dhankar said market forces cause drastic changes in the selling price of farmers' produce. On efforts to stabilise vegetable prices, Dhankar informed, ""There are plans to levy more taxes when prices improve, and use the funds collected for farmers' welfare when the prices drop.""The minister said that the state government has already requested the Centre to procure 50% to states' sunflower seeds produce at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3,950 per quintal.To a question on farm debt waiver, Dhankar replied that the state government's main focus is to make farmers self-sufficient instead. He said that a target has been fixed to increase farmers' income to Rs 1 lakh per acre. But he also said that farmers across the world require assistance in the form of subsidies as the agricultural sector does not yield earnings as high as that of the service sector. ""Therefore, the state government offered subsidies to the tune of Rs 11,000 crore per year,"" he said.He informed that during his tour to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, the delegation studied techniques adopted for horticulture, floriculture, dairying, animal husbandry, storage and transportation of wheat, which would be replicated in Haryana.Taking a dig at the protesting Congress leaders in the state, Dhankar said that the Swaminathan commission's report was submitted to the government in 2006 but the previous Congress government failed to implement its recommendations. ""In fact, the then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda had formed a committee which further delayed the implementation of the recommendations,"" he said.The minister told that against the commission's recommendation of compensation of Rs 10,000 per acre to farmers, the Congress government paid them only Rs 6,000 per acre whereas the BJP government gave compensation to the tune of Rs 12,000 per acre to farmers."
252,Farmers appeal for loan waiver,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170622/jsp/northeast/story_158115.jsp,2017-06-22,Telegraph,"Village elders and farmers address the news conference in Shillong on Wednesday Shillong, June 21: With low returns on agricultural produce causing distress, farmers from the fertile farms of Meghalaya's East Khasi Hills today sought loan waivers and minimum support prices to be able to sustain cultivation. From the villages of Jongksha, Thynroit, Pingwait, Iewrynghep, Thangbnaiand Pyngkya, falling under the Mawkynrew community and rural development block of East Khasi Hills, the farmers today complained of distress because of low returns, disproportionate to the investments made by them on various agricultural produce. These villages, which are around 40km from here, are known for cultivating potatoes, tomatoes, French beans, cabbage and broomsticks, among others. They are part of more than 100 villages under the block with a population of not less than 50,000, and where almost all the households are engaged in agriculture. ""The farmers are distressed because agricultural produce do not fetch a good price. The price is disproportionate with what they have invested,"" Jongksha village chief Olet Kharsahnoh, who came along with a group of farmers to the news conference, said. For instance, he said, this year, the price of potatoes per kg which is being sold by the farmers to the traders is a mere Rs 8-10 while the investment made per kg is not less than Rs 15. With no minimum support price for the produce and with the absence of government regulation, he said the farmers are at the mercy of ""middlemen"" who take them for a ride. But that is not all. If the returns are low, the farmers are further distressed with the lack of manure. ""The state government has been propagating the use of organic manure. But there is dearth of organic manure, and hence we are forced to purchase chemical fertilisers at a high price from the black market,"" Kharsahnoh said. Thynroit village council secretary Harkin Warjri pointed out that several farmers have availed of loans of Rs 50,000 from the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme. But because of the low returns, they have been unable to clear their debts. ""We hope that the government will waive off the loans. This would alleviate the farmers' problems,"" Warjri said. Augustine Lyngba, chief of Iewrynghep village, said even those farmers who cultivate broomsticks are facing a difficult time. ""Last year, we could still manage to sell the broomsticks at Rs 60-80 per kg. But this year, it is in the range of Rs 10-37 per kg while the investment is Rs 40-60 per kg,"" Lyngba pointed out. However, he could not pinpoint the reason of this sudden fall in price. Betel leaf planter and chief of Pyngkya village, Kyrshan Pyngrope, demanded that the government should recognise betel leaf as an agricultural product and not as a forest produce. ""Through betel leaf cultivation, we are actually helping in the conservation of trees. We are also planting trees wherever required as part of the cultivation. We have been explaining this to government officials but till date betel leaf has not been recognised as an agricultural produce,"" Pyngrope said. After enlisting their woes, the farmers now want the government to regulate the prices of agricultural produce, and come up with a minimum support price for the products, besides waiving off loans and providing manure. ""The farmers are usually described as the backbone of the economy. But this is mere rhetoric as nobody cares for us,"" Warjri said."

(Source: Express Archive) Haryana Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar. (Source: Express Archive)AFTER FARMERS in Haryana were forced to sell potatoes for as low a price as 20 paise per kg, the BJP government in the state is thinking of creating a system to help peasants whenever they resort to distress sale. State Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar on Wednesday said the government has planned to offer some sort of support price to such farmers for crops like potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower and onion, which are currently outside the ambit of MSP (Minimum Support Price).Recently, The Indian Express had highlighted how farmers sold potatoes at 20 paise per kg at the Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra district.We have discussed this issue with the chief minister today to explore how prices of these vegetables can be stabilised. If there are good prices for such crops, then the government may levy more taxes especially on the commission agents so that the government can offer money from this fund to the farmers in case of a drop in prices, said Dhankar, a former national president of the BJP Kisan Morcha.When asked about the waiver of farm loans by neighbouring states, Dhankar said, We are working to make farmers self-sufficient instead of depending on loans by aiming to increase their income to Rs 1 lakh per acre. However, it is a reality that farmers in all corners of the world require assistance in the form of subsidies as the agriculture sector does not result in earnings as high as that of the service sector.The Haryana farmers are on the warpath alleging that their crops were being purchased at throwaway prices this year. Keeping in view the stir, the state government on Wednesday decided to buy 50 per cent of the sunflower crop at MSP.Till now, it had been procuring just 25 per cent of the crop at MSP, which is Rs 3,950 per quintal.In the absence of MSP, the farmers were forced to sell the sunflower crop at the rate of around Rs 2,500 per quintal.For the time being, the farmers have decided not to sell their sunflower crop at throwaway prices. We want that 100 per cent crop of sunflower of the farmers be purchased at the rate of MSP otherwise it has no meaning, said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, Haryana.The farmers have announced to stage a half-naked protest at the grain market of Shahbad Markanda (Kurukshetra) on June 24 when Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar would go to the town to address a rally.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Gurmukh Singh, 44, is one of better-to-do farmers of Pandrali, a quiet, well-groomed village in Fatehgarh Sahib district with several newly-built houses, smooth streets and girls on scooters. Its a picture that could well be captioned prosperous Punjab. But the genteel faade hides the struggles of the states farming community.I am a farmer, have never done anything else, but its not sustainable any longer, Gurmukh clears his throat. A former village head, he is clearly uneasy about sharing his troubles with strangers. The price of potato, the crop he grew on part of the land hes leased, has crashed. It means more debt for he has to pay a rent of Rs 40,000 for an acre though his potato crop has fetched him only Rs 25,000. This is what happens when you diversify, he fumes.This week, the Punjab government announced a waiver of crop loans up to Rs 2 lakh for small and marginal farmers (up to five acres). Gurmukh is relieved that he falls in this bracket but wishes the government had announced a complete loan waiver. I know the state has limited funds, but the Centre should rescue farmers, he opines.Like most farmers in the state, this matriculate grows wheat and paddy, the two crops with a guaranteed minimum support price (MSP). Paddy has leached the land of water leading to fears of desertificationthe water table at Pandrali has breached 70 feet, and is falling at the rate of three feet a yearyet farmers refuse to grow other crops. I have tried turmeric, sugarcane, maize and vegetables, but marketing is a problem. The sugarcane mills dont pay us for months and prices of other crops are erratic, explains Gurmukh.RISING COST OF PRODUCTIONBut now even the MSP of the two main crops, he rues, is becoming unviable due to the spiralling cost of inputs. Its simple maths. In 1992, says Gurmukh, diesel cost Rs 4-5 a litre, a sack of diammonium phosphate (DAP) Rs 200, while wheat cost Rs 5 a kilo. Now while diesel is pegged at Rs 58 a litre and DAP is 1100 for a sack, but wheat has failed to keep pace at Rs 16 a kilo. Add to it the cost of boring tubewells every year due to the dipping water level, the steeply priced pesticides scarcely used in the past, and the cost of labour from UP and Bihar in the absence of local helping hands, says Gurmukh, explaining the high cost of production. A bore costs anywhere between Rs 10,000 and 1 lakh.Watch | Farmers have to borrow money to farmGroundwater irrigates over 73% of land in the state. This has led to a sharp decline in the water table. According to the Central Ground Water Board, of the 138 administrative blocks in Punjab, 110 blocks are overexploited, four are critical and two are semi-critical. Only 22 blocks are safe, but they have other problems such as arsenic, fluoride and uranium contamination.One reason for the indiscriminate use of groundwater is free electricity for farmers introduced in 1999. Also, the Punjab government hasnt placed any restriction on the depth of tubewells. Nor does one need any permission to dig up a well.Inadequate rainfall in the last few years is only increasing the general dependence on groundwater. The year 2014 was very rough on us, so was 2015, recounts Gurmukh. In 2015, Punjab received only 50% of the monsoon rainfall, and the next year it was 36%.Little wonder then that any mention of digging up Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal to provide water to Haryana raises hackles. The Bhakra canal flows 1.5 km from here; the Sirhind feeder and Narwana branch are also close but all the water flows to Haryana and Rajasthan, gripes a friend of Gurmukh.Haryana, he claims, also has the job advantage as it borders both Chandigarh and Delhi. They have benefited from industrialisation and the Gurgaon boom, says Gurmukh, adding how a working man drawing a salary of 35,000 a month is better off than a farmer who owns 10 acres.Haryana also offers a better market price for alternative crops such as sunflower. It fetches Rs 25,000 per quintal in Punjab while in Haryana it gets Rs 35,000, says Gurmukh.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?The crop prices show no signs of increasing but land rental rates are going through the roof and range between 40,000 and 45,000 an acre in the district. With farming becoming unviable, more and more small farmers are leasing out their land instead of toiling on it. These landlords seek a rise of 10% every year regardless of any natural calamity or price crash, grouses Gurmukh. He recalls 2015 when he was forced to sell his export-grade Basmati (PB 1509) to the Food Corporation of India after the prices crashed from Rs 4,500 a quintal in 2014 to 1700 in 2015.Ask Gurmukh why he takes so much land on lease, and he points to his machinery. I have a tractor, a seed sower, a land leveler, a roller et al. I need land to make the most of them. Also, there is the lure of a good crop and the pressure of repaying the debt.Demonetisation dealt a heavy blow to Gurmukh who wanted to repay a crop loan. I had just sold my crop and deposited two lakh in my bank but I could only withdraw 5,000 a week. Somehow the little sums of money I took out were spent elsewhere while the interest on my loan piled up.Gurmukh Singh with daughter Gurpreet Kaur and wife Ranjeet Kaur in his House in Pandriali village in Sirhind district, Punjab. (Ravi Kumar/HT Photo)THE DEBT TRAPIn 2007, Gurmukh took a loan of Rs 5 lakh to build his house. While the house loan was from a bank, most of his other loans are from commission agents (arhtiya or the middlemen) who charge a higher rate of interest than banks. But Gurmukh appears resigned to working with them. Here is the reason: In Punjab, a farmer cannot sell his produce in the open market at the prevailing price. He can only sell it to commission agents under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Act, 1961. A few days back, the Congress government passed an amendment to the act, allowing private players to set up mandis to purchase farm produce. But Gurmukh is yet to learn about it.As of now, the middleman also doubles up as a dealer of seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers. So farmers not only sell their produce to him, but also purchase their inputs from him, often on credit.Milked dry Farmers in the grain bowl of the country, Punjab, are a distressed lot Rs 69,335 crore Rural debt Rs 5.5 lakh Per capita rural household debt 98% Area under irrigation 110 out of 138 blocks are water dark zones (water table dangerously low) 1.6% Rate of agri growth in Punjab from 2004-05 to 2014-15 1.5% Punjabs share of Indias total area FARMER SUICIDES6,926 No. of suicides between 2000 and 2011*1,309 Farm suicides in seven districts between April 2013 and Dec 2016No. of suicides between 2000 and 2011*Farm suicides in seven districts between April 2013 and Dec 2016Despite being a farmers daughter and wife, Ranjeet doesnt think highly of farming. No one values the farmer, she says.The couples only offspring, Gurpreet, who is doing post-graduation in English from a college in Fatehgarh Sahib, is now looking forward to a bank tellers course. The young woman, who stitches her clothes herself, may not be sure about her career path, but she is clear that her husband will not be a farmer. No way, she declares. Its too risky. No matter how hard you work, there is no guarantee of profit.Youngsters in the village, she claims, want to either get a job or go abroad. Farming is an option only for the uneducated.Jagtar Singh, Gurmukhs man Friday who works on his land for Rs 1 lakh a year, agrees. In farming, you throw money for six months and then dont know whether you will get it back or not. A salaried job is better.The only person who appears contented in the fields is Harendra Kumar from Motihari district in Bihar, who is here with his team of 10 labourers. We will sow paddy, he explains as he arranges ladoos for a pooja before they begin work. He explains, We pray for a bumper crop, our wellbeing and that of sardar ji.Amen to that."

(PTI) During the protests in Mandsaur. (PTI)How money reached themWhen five protesters died on June 6 in alleged police firing near Mandsaur, the epicentre of the farmers unrest, the government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and later doubled it to Rs 10 lakh. But with anger spreading to other parts of the state and the import of its political damage sinking in, by the end of the day, Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan announced an unprecedented compensation  Rs 1 crore and a job to a family member of each of the victims.Opposition parties accused the BJP government of bidding over dead bodies and the district collector, since transferred and later suspended, publicly expressed his inability to pay the compensation, saying anything more than Rs 4 lakh was beyond his mandate.A week later, as Chouhan travelled to meet the family members, his secretariat ensured that the money was electronically transferred to the bank accounts of the families. Citing exceptional circumstances, the secretariat sent a note-sheet with the CMs signature to the General Administration Department (GAD) to clear the money. The GAD, in turn, sent a formal sanction letter to the collector, who later transferred the money from the local treasury.Officials in the CMs secretariat said there was no limit to the amount that can be sanctioned under the CMs discretionary fund. By its very definition, its the CMs discretion and the process is not bound by rules. The amount can be Rs 10,000 or Rs 1 crore, a top officer in the secretariat told The Sunday Express.In normal circumstances, the process is rigorous and requires verification.The CM had doled out huge amounts in the past, but that was restricted to players such as P V Sindhu, who got Rs 50 lakh from the discretionary fund after she won the silver medal at the Rio Olympics. Soldiers from the state who die in the line of duty usually get Rs 10 lakh.The BJP high command was reportedly unhappy with the hefty compensation, fearing it could set a precedent. When the sixth death, allegedly in police custody, took place in Mandsaur a few days later, family members and relatives of Ghanshyam Dhakad said they would not cremate his body until they were compensated with Rs 1 crore and a job. Since then, the Congress has demanded that every suicide by farmers be compensated with Rs 1 crore.To put things in perspective, a look at compensation packages announced in the past: On September 13, 2015, the day after an explosion left 80 people dead in Petlawad town, Chief Minister Chouhan announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and a job to a family member. A farmer who was killed in police firing in Bareli, Raisen district, in 2012 got a compensation of Rs 2 lakh. The farmers were protesting against the delay in procurement of wheat caused by a shortage of gunny bags. In 1998, when the Congress was in power in the state, more than 19 farmers were killed in police firing in Multai town of Betul district. The victims families got Rs 2 lakh in compensation from the state government and Rs 50,000 from the Prime Ministers fund. The compensation for those who died in the 1984 gas tragedy was hiked to Rs 10 lakh in 2010.Family hopes to use the money for Satyanarayans father Mangilals (above) treatment. (Photo: Oinam Anand) Family hopes to use the money for Satyanarayans father Mangilals (above) treatment. (Photo: Oinam Anand)Satyanarayan Dhangar, 30,Lodh villageSurvived by:Parents Mangilal Dhangar and Bhanwari Bai, brothers Kanhaiyalal and Raju, and their wives Nirmala and Manju Bai.Debt: Approximately Rs 4.5 lakh, of which Rs 3 lakh is against a tractor Satyanarayan bought  he paid instalments of about Rs 60,000 every six months; a bank loan of Rs 50,000 under the Mukhyamantri Aawas Yojana to build their house; and Rs 60,000 for the purchase of manure and seed. The family owns five bighas, of which two bighas stand mortgaged for Rs 40,000 (the land deed is shared by the extended family), along with about 300 grams of silver and a gold-plated necklace for Rs 7,000.The Family: Having studied till Class 10, Satyanarayan was the most educated in the family; Kanhaiyalal studied till Class 2 and Raju till Class 5.Satyanarayan used to take care of all the household finances, says Kanhaiyalal, He was charming so he would convince people that he would pay off his debts later. Satyanarayan never married.The brothers, their wives, and the parents occupy a room each. The family grows wheat and alsi (flax) on their land. Last season, they also grew potatoes and peas. When not in the fields, the brothers work as labourers and are said to be good at reinforcing wells.Satyanarayans father, Mangilal Dhangar, prefers to sleep outside. The day The Sunday Express met the family, he was on a cot in the open, crying out in pain. He finally slips off the cot onto the mud floor. As he keeps groaning, the brothers call an ambulance and he is taken away. He was fine until now, says his wife Bhanwari.Whats in the house: Three cots, a ceiling fan, a table fan, lots of utensils and a tractor.That day: He had joined the protests because he was frustrated with falling prices, says brother Raju. Our debts kept rising and the returns from farm kept declining.Rs 1 crore: We will pay off our debt, though the Chief Minister told us he will get it all waived, says Raju. Some money might also be used for their fathers treatment. With the rest, they plan to buy some land.Its worth: Over 22 times their total debt.He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand) He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand)Kanhaiyalal Patidar, 44,Chillod Piplya villageSurvided by: Wife Sumitra, daughter Puja and son Jitendra.Debt: None, says wife Sumitra. He bought seeds and manure with help from the cooperative society. The interest on the societys loan is zero per cent for the first year and seven per cent from then on, so he avoided the interest, says wife Sumitra.The Family: Kanhaiyalal lived with his wife and children in a small, two-storey unplastered and unfurnished house, next to the homes of his two brothers, Jagdish and Ganpat, and other relatives.Like each of his brothers, Kanhaiyalal owned six bighas, on which he grew wheat, soybean and garlic. With the rate of wheat hovering between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,200 a quintal, and that of garlic between Rs 800 and Rs 2,000 a quintal, each of us made only around Rs 30,000 last year, says Jagdish. Kanhaiyalal also had a cow and a buffalo and sold some of the milk. Milk sells for Rs 20-22 a litre, the price of water, says his mother, Debu Bai. The brothers also worked as daily-wage labourers.Whats in the house: Of the two rooms in the house, one is on the ground floor, and the other on the roof, which doubles up as a kitchen. There is a storehouse which has a few sacks of produce, an agricultural weighing machine and Kanhaiyalals motorcycle.That day: Kharcha nahi baith raha tha (Expenses exceeded our earnings), says Sumitra. Isiliye andolan mein gaye thhe (Thats why he joined the protest).The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the bank accounts of Sumitra and the children. Bank officials have told us that we cannot withdraw money from the childrens accounts yet and need permission from the bade sahab (big boss), says Laxmi Narayan, Sumitras father. The children say they are inspired by a relative, a doctor uncle in Ratlam, and want to be doctors too. While daughter Puja managed 50 per cent in Class 10, son Jitendra scored 70 per cent in Class 7.Sumitra says the childrens share of money will be saved as fixed deposits. Kanhaiyalals brothers also indicate they will be given some money to continue farming on his land. We will hire labourers to till his fields. All of us will also move to a better place within this village, says Jagdish. Then there are the villagers who have donated to set up a bust of martyr Kanhaiyalal in the middle of the village.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore is 625 times Pujas annual school fee of Rs 16,000, which Kanhaiyalal could not afford; his father-in-law, Laxmi Narayan, would pay the childs fee. Kanhaiyalal took care of his sons education, which cost him Rs 12,000 a year. Masterji in school told me I wont be allowed to take my exams if I didnt pay the fee. My father always somehow paid, says son Jitendra.The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand) The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand)Ghanshyam Salitra, 30,Badwan villageSurvived by: Wife Rekha Bai, four-year-old son Rudra, month-old daughter Himanshi, father Durgalal Dhakad, sister Shamu BaiDebt: The family owes Rs 3 lakh to two banks and another Rs 2 lakh to a cooperative society. The loan goes back years. Almost all of it was to buy seeds, manure, pay for labour, hire machines, says father Durgalal.The Family: Ghanshyam never saw his daughter Himanshi. He was at the protest site on June 8, when his wife, Rekha, returned from her maternal home, where she had delivered her daughter. He left hours before I arrived, she says. His four-year-old son Rudra jumps around the house before coming back to play with his sister.Ghanshyam had enrolled Rudra in a private English-medium school, where the annual fee is Rs 10,000, says Ghanshyams wife Rekha.The family owns four bighas on which they grow wheat, garlic and fenugreek. Soon after Ghanshyams Class 12, he started working in their fields. The chief minister came and assured me Rs 1 crore. I told him to bring back my husband. I asked him who will take care of my children. He said the government would bear all their education expenses and give me a job, says Rekha.They killed my only son, says Durgalal.Whats in the house: A bedroom, another for the produce, and a third that doubles up as a kitchen and temple. Two cows, two buffaloes, a bull and a calf, and a dog, Kalu, in a fenced enclosure. Also, three fans and a television.That day: He and other men from the village were protesting and chanting Jai Jawan! Jai Kisan! when police caned them. He tried to run but got stuck in the fence. Police took him to the station. I later came to know they hit him on his head and throat till he fell down, Durgalal says. They came home around 3.30 that night and claimed he was injured. They told us to reach the police station at 9 am, but by then they had taken him to a hospital in Indore. By the time my father-in-law got there, he was dead, Rekha says.The Rs 1 crore: Our father went to Mandsaur to open accounts in the name of the children, says Ghanshyams sister Shamu. Some money has been transferred into the accounts but we dont know how much.Its worth: Zero. This crore is not worth my husband, says Rekha.Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand) Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand)Abhishek Dinesh, 18Barkheda Panth villageSurvived by: Parents Dinesh and Alka Bai, brothers Madhusudan and Sandeep, grandparents Bhanwar Lal and Lakshmi BaiDebt: None. But this January, the family sold off 6 of their 29.5 bighas to cushion their expenses.The Family: Most mornings, Abhishek would assist in the fields before leaving for school around 11 am. He would then return to the farm by 5 pm, finally getting home late in the evening. He would also skip schools when there was a lot of work at the farm, says brother Madhusudan.In the just declared results of Class 11, Abhishek had scored 47.2 per cent. He wanted to do an agriculture course once he was done with school, says Sandeep, who is enrolled in a BBA course.The family grows soybean, wheat, bajra, corn, lentils. Over the past four to five years, the price of soybean has halved from around Rs 5,000 a quintal to around Rs 2,500 now. We also sold 52 quintals of onion for Rs 6,500 at Rs 1.25 per kg. How can a household run like this? asks father Dinesh.Whats in the house: There are logs of sal, about 1.5 feet in width, overhead, going across the roof of the rooms. Above them are bamboo poles, which hold a bamboo mat and the mud roof. Thats how the roof has been in this house since 1957, when we built it, says Abhisheks grandfather Bhanwar Lal, in his early 90s. The house has four rooms and a large hall which was renovated about three years ago, apart from a kitchen.That day: He had gone to the protests as he was curious others from the village were also going, says mother Alka Bai. Everyone goes to protest if the cause is genuine, adds grandfather Bhanwar Lal.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the accounts of Abhisheks parents. They first plan to buy back the land they sold earlier this year. They also want to buy more property and reinforce their well. Brother Sandeep will get the government job. Relatives have also been turning up frequently. I learnt of Abhisheks death today (a week after the incident) and came running, says Ramesh Chand Patidar, a relative.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore can cultivate their 23 bighas nearly 72 times over. It takes Rs 6,000 roughly to cultivate a bigha of land, says Dinesh.Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand) Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand)Poonamchand Patidar alias Babloo, 23Takrawad villageSurvived by: Wife Anita, mother Durga Bai and sister GirijaDebt: Rs 4 lakh in unpaid home loans and about a couple of lakh more in agricultural dues for labour, seed and manure purchase, and tractor rent, among others. The family also paid Rs 50,000 for a hysterectomy operation that Babloos mother had over a month ago.The Family: With their savings and some loans, Babloos father Jagdish Ram and uncle Bala Ram built the two-storey house that Babloo lived in with wife Anita, mother Durga Bai, uncle Bala Ram and cousin Dasrath. His father had passed away in January last year, after which he dropped out of college and married Anita. The house, with eight rooms, was built two years ago, when the family enjoyed better times.Babloo inherited his fathers eight bigha on which he grew wheat, coriander, garlic and chickpeas. He also helped out on his uncles farm. We sold a quintal each of wheat for Rs 1,100, coriander for Rs 4,000, fenugreek for Rs 1,500 and garlic for Rs 3,000. Over a year ago, the rates were Rs 2,000, Rs 7,000, Rs 4,000 and Rs 8,000, says Bala Ram, who too owns eight bighas. So while he spent Rs 96,000 on the farm, he made only about Rs 60,000 last year, he adds. Moreover, the cheques against payments take over a month to be cleared, says cousin Dasrath. When not in the fields, Babloo used to repair vehicles, especially vans, to make ends meet.Whats in the house: The house is mostly empty. A crib dangles in the middle of one of the rooms.That day: Around 150 youth from our village went to protest. Police shot at a few of them from close range. He was among those hit. Villagers told us police shot him on the road. The villagers rushed him to a hospital in Mandsaur on a motorcycle but he died on the way, says Babloos uncle Bala Ram.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred to a joint account opened in the names of Babloos mother and wife. The heavy dose of drugs after her operation has left Babloos mother with mental troubles, says Bala Ram. Babloos wife Anita has left for her maternal home and will return soon, he says. Sister Girija Bai too shows little interest in money matters and so, it for Bala Ram and his son Dasrath to decide. We still get notices from the bank. So we will pay that off first, says Dasrath, who dropped out of school after Class X and will get the government job.Then there are the relatives, who have not left the home since Babloos death. Will we get money? And when? Everyone only comes and takes down our names, says Babloos aunt Lakshmi. His mother Durga Bai sits expressionless.Its worth: The compensation money is 200 times the cost of his mothers operation.He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand) He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand)Chainaram Patidar, 23Nayakheda villageSurvived by: Wife Pushpa, parents Ganpat Lal and Manju Bai, younger brother Govind, sister PavitraDebt: Only Chainaram kept a record of the expenses, so the family has little idea if they had any loans, though they say he used to borrow from the cooperative society. If there is any debt, they dont know about it as no one has approached them yet.The Family: Chainarams two-room house is one of about a dozen small houses  mostly of his uncles and cousins  that lie on either side of a narrow lane within Nayakheda village.The family owns two bighas on which they grow wheat and soybean. When not on the fields, Chainaram would, like his daily-wager father, go looking for work.Keen on joining the Army, as a couple of village youths are in the forces, Chainaram began applying around five years ago, after he turned 18. He had good height and could run quite a bit. He cleared the physical test thrice but would always be ruled out in the medical tests; his left eye was weak, says father Ganpat, 43. On April 29 this year, Chainaram married Pushpa. She is still dazed and barely speaks.Whats in the house: A cooking stove and gas cylinder, an earthen pot and utensils. The family sleeps on the floor under the only ceiling fan in the house, which has to be prodded with a stick for it to start rotating.That day: The family says he had gone to the protest, but just to look. Villagers said he had been hit on his leg. It was only the next day that we were told he was hit on his head, says sister Pavitra.The Rs 1 crore: The money will be divided among 4-5 people, says Ganpat. There are Ganpats brothers  Rameshwar, Balu Ram, Paras Ram  and his cousins, all of whom, he says, will receive a share of the crore. Also, neighbours Mangilal, 61, and Phool Chand, 72, who have lent a shoulder. But Ganpat doesnt know how it will be divided. I am uneducated. Chainarams uncle Bharat does all the work, he has all the documents. We will all sit and divide the money soon, he says.Its worth: The compensation is 376 times the value of his familys wheat production. Last year, they produced 19 quintals of wheat and sold half of it for Rs 1,400 a quintal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Addressing a press conference in Lucknow, UP state Congress vice president Sataydev Tripathi and spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh released a parallel booklet titled 100 din, 100 fareb (100 days, 100 lies).While speaking to the media, Tripathi said, There has been a four-fold increase in crime and the promises of putting all criminals behind bars now appear laughable. Roads have not been made pot-hole free by June 15. Apart from this, the proposal to buy potato at the rate of Rs 487 per quintal too has proved to be a big flop. The Congress spokesperson also added that despite innumerable reminders by the chief minister to his cabinet and senior officials regarding the disclosure of their personal asset, still more than half of them are yet to submit the details.Congress termed UP governments initiatives as farce such as reducing fees of private schools, distribution of free laptops, 24 hours power supply, power-for-all, anti-Romeo squads, womens safety, Gaupalak Yojana, rural employment, anti-land mafia task force, cleaning of river Gomti and an anti-corruption task force.Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath addressed a press conference on completion of its 100 days in office, and released a booklet called 100 din vishwas ke on his governments performance since he assumed office on March 19. The chief minister expressed satisfaction over the tasks his government undertook in its first 100 days in office. The BJP had assumed office on March 19 after a thumping victory in Uttar Pradesh legislative polls bagging 325 of the 403 Assembly seats along with its allies.The BJP had assumed office on March 19 after a thumping victory in Uttar Pradesh legislative polls bagging 325 of the 403 Assembly seats along with its allies.with PTI inputsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The price of sugar has shot up by Rs 25 per kilogram and the prices of eggs have almost doubled.But worse may still be in store with supplies of edibles dwindling and replenishing the stock becoming extremely difficult due to problems in movement of goods vehicles. The residents who are the worst affected are too scared to identify themselves while narrating their plight.""The situation is grim here.People do not have disposal cash in hand and most of the shops are shut. Some shops that are open are selling things at very high prices,"" said a resident of Darjeeling.According to local people, the situation is even worse in Kalimpong and Kurseong with reports of people stopping goods-laden truck and fleeing with the edibles and other ingredients of daily use. ""Since these two places are not in focus, the situation is even worse here.We are fast running out of food and other things,"" said a resident of Kalimpong.Joyoshi Dasgupta, district magistrate of Darjeeling, did not comment but sources ad mitted that the prices were skyrocketing in the absence of any replenishment. ""If the situation continues like this, nobody knows what the condition will be,"" said an officer. Many GJM supporters did distribute vegetables and biscuits in some pockets on Tuesday but they were clearly inadequate to cater to the widespread demand.Chotan Mukhia, a grocer in Darjeeling, said: ""Two days ago a few women came to my residence at around 2am and requested for some vegetables and sugar. They did not have any money on them. I told them I could not open my shop because other people may attack and take away the ingredients since there is a crisis. But they insisted so much that I had to relent and give them what they wanted. They promised to pay me later. I had to trust them,"" said Mukhia.Another crisis is looming over the public health care system since the Darjeeling District hospital is left with only 40 units of blood. It is also the referral centre for the primary health care centres in the district.The doctors are not issuing medicines with short expiry dates that are being desptached to primary health centres."

The four-hour event was organized at the local grain market with Tanwar and his men staying away.MLAs owing allegiance to Hooda, former minister Sampat Singh, ex-chief parliamentary secretary (CPS) Prahlad Singh Gillakhera and other Congress leaders from Sirsa, Fatehabad and Hisar districts attended the event.Addressing the farmers Hooda, who was accompanied by his MP son Deepender Hooda, said, ""I am farmer's son and can feel your pain. Without any promise, we have waived off the farmers' loans worth Rs 850 crore and electricity bill arrears worth Rs 1,600 crore in 10 years. On the other hand, this government is not able to take even a single farmer-related measure in three years.""He said potatoes were sold almost free but it did not reflect in the price of chips. ""Poplar wood is sold in distress but there is no effect on the rates of plywood. Similarly there is no drop in the rates of ketchup despite the fact that the farmers were forced to sell of tomatoes at throwaway prices,"" he said.Hooda took a dig on state agriculture minister Om Parkash Dhankar and BJP Haryana president Subhash Barala. ""Those who staged half-naked agitations earlier over farmers' issues are keeping mum over the implementation of the Swaminathan commission's report. Only ones have benefited from this government are companies involved in crop insurance,"" he said.Referring to the good and services tax (GST), the former Haryana CM said small entrepreneurs would earn only for the government and chartered accountants or they would vanish.

261,State asks Centre to raise rice quota,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/jun/30/state-asks-centre-to-raise-rice-quota-1622520.html,2017-06-30,The New Indian Express,"BHUBANESWAR: THE State Government on Thursday reiterated its demand for more rice for additional 17 lakh people under National Food Security Act (NFSA). The issue of Central contribution to the revolving fund created to support market interventions for price stabilisation of perishable agricultural commodities was raised during the meeting of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister SN Patro with Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Ram Vilas Paswan in New Delhi.The Centre has been allocating food grains to Odisha based on the 2011 Census. Meanwhile, population of the State has grown by four to five per cent during the last six years as is evident from the trends of decadal growth rate in Odisha from the Census report.I requested the Union Minister to increase the upper ceiling of Odisha by 15 lakh individuals for coverage of left out eligible population into NFSA fold keeping in view the projected population growth from 2011 to 2017 and more importantly, the backwardness of the State with higher density of Scheduled category people, Patro told this paper after the meeting.The State has been allotted rice for 3,26,41,800 out of States total population of 4,19,74,218 under NFSA in priority household, Annapurna Anna Yojana and Antyodaya Anna Yojana, Patro said.The upper ceiling for the State has been determined at 82.17 per cent of rural population and 55.77 per cent of urban population with reference to the NSS household consumption survey data for 2011-12 available with Planning Commission.Projecting the population figure of the State at 436.50 lakh, Patro urged the Union Minister to fix the upper ceiling for the State at Rs 340.49 lakh against Rs 326.41 lakh fixed by the Centre.Since there is no provision of auto inclusion under NFSA, Paswan said his Ministry is planning to bring an amendment in the Act in next session of the Parliament.Patro further requested Paswan to release the Central share of Rs 50 crore to the States revolving fund created for market intervention to save farmers from distress sale of perishable agri-horticultural commodities, like potato and onion.The State has created a corpus of Rs 100 crore under Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) scheme of the Centre for the purpose. Though Odisha has provided its share of `50 crore, the Centre is yet to release its matching share."

Some had problems with online registration as the GSTN site kept crashing throughout the day while others had to contend with software changes. But none knew how, or how much, to charge?For sweet shop owners in the city, billing was arduous. The GST rates for milk sweets like rosgolla, rasmalai and ghee-roasted sweets like carrot halwa are quite different under the new structure.""We have checked with our tax consultant, but still it is confusing. For instance, milk sweets like basundi, sandesh are coming under 5% tax, but if we choose to coat them with silver foil we would have to pay a tax of 18-20%,"" said Vignesh Kaur of K C Das Sweets. ""Likewise, rosogolla, rasmallai should be at 5%, but if we add kesar it would go up to 18-20%. Then again any chocolate-coated item is taxed at 28%,"" he said.At supermarket chains like Sri Murugan Stores , confusion was more pronounced. ""Tax on snacks like aloo bhujia, potato chips, samosa, kachori is 12%. Now the tax rate for cashews is 5%, but I can't figure out if masala cashew is a snack or a standalone item,"" said Rajarathinam, owner, Sri Murugan Stores.Such problems pervaded all and sundry. For instance, at Landmark Group , which has more than 250 franchisees, billing has been stopped at smaller outlets.""We are yet to figure out the rates for many of the items on the inventory list. Many of our smaller outlets in Kerala and Tamil Nadu have stopped billing. We have advised our franchisees to convert to tally to avoid confusion -- some of them still use local software for billing,"" said CEO of Landmark Group Jerry Mathews.But sales have been excellent despite the problems. ""We have had bumper sales. Usually June is a busy month because of back-to-school sales. But this June, GST clearance sales were higher than New Year, Christmas and Onam sales,"" said Mathews.Heavy sales were also seen at Future Group chain Big Bazaar.

After remaining stable till a few weeks ago, tomato prices rapidly increased at Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale markets. Vendors purchase a 25-kg tomato case for Rs 600 and sell native tomatoes at Rs 40 per kg. Tomatoes of higher quality are sold at Rs 50 a kg.However, retailers who buy the same case at Rs 600, sell tomatoes at Rs 65 a kg at Anna Nagar and Kilpauk. The price is high for the past two days. It was at Rs 24 a kg and now it has reached Rs 56. I have cut down on the quantity, says V Nagalakshmi.Supply is less. As tomatoes come from Andhra and Karnataka, the climate there also matters to cultivate crops. Excess rain or heat, both can damage the growth of tomato plants, says Ambedkar V, a vendor.Wholesale markets at Porur and Kilpauk were closed on Friday and those that were open wore a deserted look. With tomato prices on the high, the wholesale price of onion seemed decent. It was sold at Rs 13 a kg in wholesale and Rs 20 a kg in retail.Some retail shops at Anna Nagar sold onion at Rs 80 a kg.Onions and potatoes are being sold at Rs 20 a kg. But Rs 80 is too expensive, says Arjun.V, a wholesaler."

Mr. Abubakkar, 26, moved to Dubai in 2015 to work as a customer care agent for a courier service. In February this year, his company transferred him to Doha, the capital of Qatar.Mr. Abubakkar returned to Dubai in June to process his residence visa for Qatar and was getting ready to fly back to Doha when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and a few other Arab countries cut diplomatic ties as well as land, sea and air links with Qatar. Many of my colleagues are also stuck in a similar position as no visas to Qatar are being processed here, but thankfully, my work has not been affected, said Mr. Abubakkar.Nearly 6,50,000 Indians are working in Qatar, which has a population of roughly 2.7 million. Only 12% of its population are native Qataris, while Indians constitute the largest group living in this tiny gas-rich nation. If one goes by sheer numbers, Indians will be the hardest hit by this diplomatic stand-off.Rising pricesInternational human rights groups have expressed concern over the impact of Qatars blockade on its migrant worker population. Adam Coogle is a West Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch and was recently in Doha assessing the impact of the diplomatic crisis on its migrant workers. He explained that none of the workers he interviewed were worried about the general situation but they have complained about the increase in food prices.The prices of basic items like tomatoes, potatoes and onions have gone up, Mr. Coogle told this writer. A labourer who was spending nearly 200-250 Qatari riyals on food every month has to now spend between 300-350 riyals, a significant rise for people whose monthly income is about 900 riyals. Contrary to the initial reports of food shortages, Qatar has filled the void by flying in supplies, mostly from Turkey, Iran and India. Food is readily available but the local options of fruit and vegetables from the neighbouring Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Lebanon have been replaced with the pricier versions from Holland, Australia, Thailand and Malaysia.In supermarkets, it is like a flash sale where the fruit and vegetables are gone even before they are put on the rack, said one local resident. I found only the expensive tomatoes from Holland at my grocery store and something basic like coriander leaves are missing from the market or cost 7 riyals a bunch. Most labour accommodations are scattered far away from the city and many workers depend on smaller grocery stores for basic needs. Such stores, they say, are taking advantage of the crisis and increasing prices. In order to crack down on such practices, Qatars Ministry of Economy and Commerce is encouraging residents to report businesses that are over-pricing supplies via social media.The ramifications of the embargo may sweep into other industries such as construction, as the country prepares to host the FIFA World Cup 2022. A lot of the construction material was brought in through these borders and due to the current crisis, it may create a lag with the ongoing construction projects, which will no doubt affect the workers, said Vani Saraswathi, associate editor at Migrant-Rights.org, an advocacy organisation that aims to advance the rights of migrant workers in West Asia. A delay in materials means there is delay in work, and we have seen subcontractors especially dont have the financial wherewithal to bide over such contingencies. This could mean workers being left unpaid, or not paid in time.Indians, who make up the largest expatriate group living in Qatar, will be the hardest hit by the diplomatic stand-off between the country and its Arab neighbours"

Hailing from the US, my Indian food experience was limited by both ignorance of the various dishes, and price point. Indian food in the U.S. is priced relatively high and often altered to better suit our bland-preferring palates. Adding to that was my general anxiety in asking what exactly an item such as palak paneer is.To celebrate my introduction to the local cuisine, a colleague took me on a mini-food tour. On our way to the first stop of the day, a vendor on a bicycle pulled up beside us with a rusty metal pot sitting on his back seat. She called him over and asked me if I wanted to try some. Inside the pot was a whitish fluid sloshing around, with no protection from the old pot. I asked what it was, and she responded with a word I fail to recollect. A sip of the drink and I got a slight cucumber taste. Its a drink made from curd, she said. I immediately gave the rest of the drink to her.We arrived at Murugan Idli Shop, Besant Nagar in time for lunch. Employees were still placing seats at tables in the far room, so we sat by the front window. Two sheets of banana leaf were placed on our table. Then the food came.A server ladled three globs of chutney onto our leaf, followed by two idli cakes  one plain and one covered in what I would discover to be a red spicy powder surely taken from the center of an active volcano. My colleague also ordered sweet pongal  essentially a kind of rice pudding  to help comfort my buring taste buds. The different chutneys  orange, white and brown  added a savoury, slightly spicy flavor that also helped mask the red powder. The idli itself was surprisingly soft and paired well with the chutney. The meal ended with a hefty serving of onion dosa, which I would describe as a sort of onion flapjack, but Ive never been a fan of onion dishes.Hours later, the two of us stopped at GSS Restaurant for some dinner. I was once again unaware of what exactly she would order. The first dish placed on our table contained what I would describe as six egg-shaped bread pouches filled with potato and onion, and two small bowls of broth. This, I was told, was pani puri. I immediately made the connection between the dish and soup dumplings, a Chinese delicacy which contains soup.On my first attempt to eat the pani puri, the shell cracked and spilled soup down my face. My second attempt was better, and the food was simple but delicious. Afterwards, we were served pav bhaji, a fast food dish originating from Maharashtra, India. The dish had vegetable curry served with two bread rolls still stuck to each other, and a side bowl filled with carrots and onion slices. It was as simple a dish as they come, but once again delicious without the overwhelming spices Id encountered multiple times already.Since then, Ive branched out and tried new dishes, from the simpler aloo methi to Indian Subway (the main takeaway where nearly every sandwich is spicy). Ive tasted the sour drink restaurants call buttermilk, despite the major difference with the substance I knew back home.Most likely my favorite discovery so far is the childrens drink, rose milk. When I read that item on a menu, my first question was why anyone would make a drink out of roses, or how you would even milk a rose. I was shocked to find that rose milk is actually surprisingly sweet and tastes very similar to strawberry milk. Lets just say if you want to get to know me better, lets have a chat over a cup of rose."

With shops and markets closed since last Sunday and supply chains cut off, people are being forced to choose between hunger and an artificial inflation.Supplies are dwindling and prices of vegetable, chicken, egg, fish, mutton and other perishable items are heading north.While fish, chicken and mutton have almost vanished from some of the markets, certain vegetables and eggs are still available but their prices however have touched a point that not many can afford for long.With prohibitory orders in the entire area and vehicles staying off the roads, supply of essential commodities in the area was badly hit. (Samir Jana)Ruma Mandal, a homemaker from the Chapapara area near Basirhat town is serving only potato curries to her family for the last few days. It is the only vegetable available in the local markets ever since tension gripped this area on Monday, she said. But potato is selling at a premium. Last week I paid Rs 8 for a kilo and today I bought two kilos for Rs 24, she complained.Price of onion is skyrocketing as well. Srinath Ghosh, a resident of the Bhyabla area, said onion used to sell for Rs 20 a kilo before a Facebook post he didnt even see changed his life. Now we are paying anything between Rs 30 and 32. Most of the shops are closed and there is an acute shortage of supply. Whatever little is coming to the markets is flying off the shelves before you can bat your eyelids. Most of the shopkeepers are taking the advantage of the situation, said Ghosh.A Trinamool Congress party office that was ransacked by locals at Mailakhola in Basirhat on Thursday. (Samir Jana)The humble egg is not far behind in the race. Price of a pair of poultry chicken eggs has increased from Rs 10 to Rs 16, said Rintu Sahana, a resident of Mailakhali area.Not willing to be quoted, a district administration official explained the real reason behind the shortage in food at Basirhat. The difference in the demographic character of Basirhat town and that of the adjoining villages is responsible for this inflation, he said.The town population comprises mostly Hindus while most of the villagers are Muslims. Markets in and around the town are heavily dependent on these villages for their daily supply of vegetable, mutton, fish, chicken and eggs. Ever since the violence started, the villagers have stopped supplying farm and animal products to the town people, he said."

After the Jind panchayat, Hooda will hold two more kisan panchayats; one at Yamunanagar and another at Nuh.Speaking to The Indian Express, Hooda said, The farmers are in trouble today.

271,Farmers weed out middlemen,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/farmers-weed-out-middlemen/articleshow/59508014.cms,2017-07-09,The Times Of India,"Across Gujarat, anger is brewing among farmers. Tomatoes and potatoes have been dumped on roads as agitations erupt for minimum support prices or loan waivers . But in the tribal hamlets of Chhota Udepur farmers have made unprecedented gains. Charoli and custard apples are bringing prosperity as farmers break free from treacherous traders' trap after centuriesBordha (Chhota Udepur): It's a dry fruit that costs not less than Rs 800 a kg; as much as cashews or almonds. But Ramesh Rathwa, a 48-year-old farmer in the remote Manka village of Chhota Udepur, never got cash for charoli, the crunchy almond-flavoured dry fruit that he collected from the forest near his hut. For all the hard work he and his wife put in from 3am to noon, they got just few pounds of grains that would last them barely a fortnight.Like Rathwa, several generations of farmers in this tribal heartland only got grains instead of money, thanks to the centuries-old saata (barter) system imposed upon them by local traders. They perennially kept these illiterate farmers in the dark about the actual value of charoli, which is widely used to add an extra crunch to sweets like kheer, mohan thaal, and basundi.But winds of change are sweeping through these far-flung villages of Chhota Udepur, the only district where charoli grows in Gujarat. Realizing the exploitation, the forest department took it upon itself to help them earn profit through an 'alternative livelihood through resource generation programme.'""We have been exploited for centuries. But three years ago, it was the first time I got Rs 7,000 cash profit for charoli,"" says Ramesh, who built a pucca house with an extra income of Rs 10,000 every year. SK Puwar, DCF, Chhota Udepur, said: ""We not only educated farmers about the value of this dry fruit but also helped them sell the produce at better rates by tying up with Reliance Fresh and other big retailers. The profits are shared with farmers.""A decortication machine of Rs four lakh was also set up in Bordha, which has now emerged as the local hub for this dry fruit, said Dipak Tank, district coordinator of the programme.""We were taught the scientific way of plucking which gave best quality seeds. Moreover, the decortication has made the tedious process of women every easy,"" said Kamlaben Rathwa, president of 11-member self-help group (SHG) in BordhaCharoli trees are spread in 836 hectares of forest in Bordha where the seeds are stored, weighed and collected by the forest department for sale. Charoli cluster includes seven villages: Manka, Bordha, Degla, Sajuli, Gabadiya, Gathiya and Runvad with every hamlet having a special team to ensure that charoli is not plucked illegally.Navsingh Rathwa, who heads the joint forest management committee (JFMC) said, ""Earlier, farmers even mortgaged silver and gave additional interest on loan to buy manure and seeds. But this exploitation by moneylenders too has stopped, thanks to cash income from charoli.""Vadodara-based Spyron Masala Mills is the biggest buyer of charoli from Bordha with annual contract of 200 kg. It must be noted that charoli is collected only once a year.N Shrivastav, additional principal chief conservator of forest, project management unit, said, ""The biggest gain from this programme is forest conservation. Villagers themselves preserve trees as they get extra income from them."""
272,Demonetisation and visible hand of market,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/621860/demonetisation-visible-hand-market.html,2017-07-09,Deccan Herald,"Demonetisation and visible hand of marketKaushik Basu, International New York Times, Jul 9 2017, 23:59 ISTlong term side-effects: Demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policy's impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected. nytIn 1776, Adam Smith described the power of the markets invisible hand. Although some economists have since overstated this power, dismissing the role of government regulation, its true that the market, when left to itself, often manages to meet a societys economic needs in ways that no one fully understands. Its a mistake for the state to disrupt it wantonly and for bureaucrats to try to do its job. And thats just the mistake India made last fall.On November 8, 2016, the NDA government suddenly declared that as of midnight that night all bills in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would cease to be legal tender. Demonetisation, as the policy is called, applied to 86% of the value of all currency in circulation. It was a state intervention of historic proportion.The goal, the government said, was to eliminate fake Indian currency notes, force people to bring out wealth they had hidden to avoid paying taxes on it  so-called black money  and help India switch from cash to digital money. To counter the criticism that erupted, the government later pointed to other countries that had adopted similar measures in recent times, including Iraq, North Korea and Venezuela.Nearly eight months later, a lot of data is now available to help us assess what demonetisation has actually wrought. Here it is, in a word: demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policys impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected.Very little black money has been caught. The truly corrupt hold their black money not as money at all, but as real estate and bank balances abroad. The government had authorised people to trade in up to Rs 4,000 in the cancelled notes, so some parcelled their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills into small bundles and got multiple agents (money mules) to change them, no questions asked. The governments freshly minted Rs 2,000 notes promptly became the new stash currency of choice.In the first weeks, even months, following demonetisation, there was visible chaos. Soviet-era-style queues snaked in front of banks and ATMs. The informal sector  mostly small traders, farmers and small unregistered businesses, which often dont have bank accounts  reeled from cash shortages.But the immediate damage caused, though large, was not as large as some of us had feared. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2016 was 7% and manufacturing activity continued to grow. On the other hand, there may be greater long-term side effects than expected.The problems appeared unexpectedly, when agricultural products arrived on the market. In January, with cash shortages in full swing, demand plunged and food prices collapsed. By February, potato prices in Uttar Pradesh were just over half of what they had been during most of 2016 (at around Rs 350 per quintal, instead of over Rs 600 per quintal).Tomato prices were less than one-third. Onion prices in May were half of what they had been a year before. The cost of onions in India is notoriously volatile  and often influenced by politics and elections  but the likeliest culprit for this years drop was demonetisation.The outcome was curious: Widespread suffering in the midst of plenty. Incomes crashed and distress mounted among farmers, a group in India already affected by high suicide rates because of mass indebtedness. And the downturn has hit more than the farming sector.The Indian economy was on a good trajectory until last year, and the government deserves credit for that. It had taken major steps to cut the costs of doing business and unify taxes on goods and services. With, in addition, the drop in world oil prices (which meant huge savings for India, an oil importer) and the rise of labour costs in China (which made Indian manufacturing and exports more competitive), there was every reason to believe that the Indian economy would soon get back to where it was before the 2008 world financial crisis: growing at over 9% per year. Instead, Indias growth in the first quarter of 2017 was 6.1%, down from 7.9% in the fiscal year 2015-16.Telltale signsAn economy is a complex machine, and there is no way to be absolutely certain that the cause of all this is demonetisation. But there is a telltale sign: Much of the slowdown originated in the financial sector. Rural loans increased by only 2.5% between October 2016 and April 2017, compared with 12.9% a year before. The rate of growth in overall bank credit declined.The growth in industrial output in April was a paltry 3.1%, down from 6.5% the previous April. In the first quarter of 2017, the construction sector actually shrank, by 3.7%, over the previous quarter.All this augurs poorly for the months to come: as the agriculture sector slows down in response to low crop prices and the credit shortage begins to bite, overall growth will likely fall further. The state-engineered shock of demonetisation will continue to course through the economy.Demonetisation did boost the use of digital money, which is more efficient than paper money. But the government didnt need to put 86% of the currency out of circulation to achieve that. Demonetisation was too coarse an approach, and it accomplished too little while causing too much collateral damage.Indias economy has enormous strengths  such as high rates of savings and investment  and this crisis will pass. But just as sailors heading to sea disregard the winds and waves at their peril, economic policy makers cannot ignore the laws of economics, and intervene in the market with a blunt and heavy hand, without risking shipwreck.(The writer, the C Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-16.)"

The farmers sold potatoes for as low as nine paisa per kg in Kurukshetra and were forced to feed tomatoes to their cattle as they did not get the right price, he said.The former CM said both the farmers and the consumers had suffered as the fall in prices of agricultural products had not reflected in the prices of the end-products.He said the prices of wheat, potatoes and tomatoes had nose-dived, but there was no change in the prices of flour, chips and the sauce, adding that the farmer was silent but not dumb."

This staple item is selling for Rs 70-80 in most parts of the city as well as Thane and Navi Mumbai.Citizens have been tweeting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to take action. The holy month of Shravan began in north India on Monday. The fasting season according to the Maharashtrian and Gujarati calendar starts July 24. As families abstain from non-vegetarian food during this time, consumption of tomato rises.Traders have no explanation for the increase other than ""unseasonal rain"". They say the situation will continue through August. This is bewildering given that farmers were dumping produce in the streets as tomato rates crashed to Re 1 per kg a few weeks ago.In Andheri market, vendor Umar said, ""We are selling good quality fruit for Rs 100 because we are purchasing for Rs 75 in the wholesale market. This stock comes from Bangalore. The crop in Maharashtra has failed due to excessive rain."" Last week, the largest trader in APMC had cited a slew of reasons including ""demonetisation, farmers' strike and bad weather"".On Monday, buyers in Thane market, Bandra and Andheri restricted themselves to purchasing half a kg. Others chose to avoid tomato. ""The greengrocer cheekily asked me why I did not want to buy tomato since I had bought other vegetables. I retorted that at Rs 80 per kg, he was welcome to keep his produce,"" said Shiuli Banerjee of Malad.Kitchens are forced to explore alternatives. Borivli housewife Rosemary Fernandes recommended that households try vinegar while Maya Mirchandani of Andheri recommended thickening the gravy with sour curd or tamarind pulp. Banerjee suggested lime juice and kokum to add sourness, and gravies thickened with potato and cornflour to tide over the crisis.Prices of onion-tomato have maintained a steady average of Rs 15-20 per kg since 2014. In previous years, the country had seen a biannual spike in rates from March-May and October-December as traders cited ""seasonal shortages"" owing to the vagaries of monsoon. This inexplicable spike has brought consumers' worst fears back to haunt them."

But more importantly, where do you think you are going to raise the 36000 crore required for loan waiver because you claim to have inherited empty coffers from the previous government?As you would have noticed, this government has cut down on wasteful expenditure. We are going to save every penny that was wasted before. You would get a sense from our first budget. But as far as bad economics goes, the per capita income of farmers in UP was among the lowest. Hit by vagaries of nature and penury they required this help. I understand loan waiver may not be a permanent solution. Lasting benefit can come to farmers when they become financially secure. Thats why PM Modi has already talked of doubling farm incomes by 2022.Would you be able to raise the mammoth amount required for loan waiver just by cutting down on wasteful expenses?Thats one of the ways. You would have noticed how the previous government wasted public money as cost of various projects kept on escalating beyond reasonable limits. The Gomti River Front Development project is a case in point. We have stopped all such frivolous expenses.There is a view that instead of loan waiver, you could have helped farmers more by helping them tap technology for better gains?UP is an agrarian state where 78% of the people live in rural areas that has about 2.33 crore farmers. Thats a huge number. Along with waiver, we are also trying to provide them better seeds and fertilisers. You would have noticed that this year a record 37 lakh metric tonne potato procurement was done and 5900 crore directly transferred to bank account of farmers. This is unprecedented.But hasnt loan waiver created problems for other BJP-ruled states from where demands to waive off loans are now being raised? More important, the centre has now said it wont foot the loan waiver bill and the states would have to raise the amount itself.The centre had made its stand clear from day one. It would be unfair to compare UPs situation with other states where farmers are much better off. This loan waiver was required under special circumstances for UP farmers whose per capita income was much below the national average.By when do you think would your government be able to roll out its loan waiver promise?Within this year itself. A three-layered committee to execute the loan waiver project has been set up. After verification from banks and revenue department we would be in a position to roll out the waiver.What do you make of the criticism that 1 lakh cap on waiver cheated many farmers with bigger farm loans?We did the best under limitations.Tell us some things that we are going to see over next 3 months?A lot is happening. But if you want quick list here it is. We intend to open 20 more krishi vigyan kendras or Agriculture Science Centres for which in principal clearance has been obtained from the centre. 43 soil testing laboratories too would come up in different districts.

277,Big relief for consumers as vegetable prices drop,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/vijayawada/2017/jul/14/big-relief-for-consumers-as-vegetable-prices-drop-1628429.html,2017-07-14,The New Indian Express,"VIJAYAWADA: Consumers can now heave a sigh of relief as prices of various vegetables have come down in the city on Thursday. At retail markets, vegetables like potato, brinjal, ladies finger are abundantly available at low prices, much to the surprise of consumers.As per the price list in Rythu Bazar on Swaraj Maidan premises, potatoes are available for Rs 13 per kg, while brinjal and ladies finger are being sold for Rs 12 and Rs 14 per kg respectively.Capsicum is priced at Rs 20 per kg while beetroot is available for Rs 30 per kg. Price of bottle gourd has also dipped to Rs 5 from Rs 10-12. While beetroot is available for Rs 26 per kg, raw banana is priced at Rs 25 per kg. Even coriander leaf has become cheaper at Rs 50-60 per kg while green chilly is selling at Rs 40 per kg. Only carrots and tomatoes are being sold for Rs 56 and Rs 62 per kg respectively.S Dhanalakshmi, a city resident, amazed at the cheap prices of vegetables said, During monsoons, availability of vegetables rises leading to moderate vegetable prices but the present phenomenon is surprising. However, local vegetable growers are complaining that they are not getting better returns. K Veerababu, a vendor said that because transportation cost remains the same, he is not able to get enough profit even after selling 30 kgs. Retail traders in smaller markets have a reason to rejoice since more customers are visiting their shops.When contacted, Rythu Bazar officials said, The market procures vegetables from neighbouring villages in Krishna and Guntur district on a daily basis as those areas have seen bumper productions. They claimed that vegetable farmers would not suffer much loss as vegetable crops are harvested in phases. After a fortnight, the prices would stabilise bringing much needed relief to the growers."

They say that they will go on protest if the government fails to provide any relief to them.District head of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh Mohan Singh Chahar said, ""The minimum support price determined by the government for procurement of potato at Rs 487 a quintal is very less."""
279,"Fruit for thought: To pay less for tomatoes, can prejudice",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ruminations/fruit-for-thought-to-pay-less-for-tomatoes-can-prejudice/,2017-07-16,The Times Of India,"Whether you pronounce it to-may-to or to-maa-to (or tamaatar), there is nothing very Indian about the tomate, as Spanish Conquistadors called the fruit (yes, it is a fruit) that grew wild in the Andes. The word tomato itself comes from the word tomatl, its name in the Aztec language Nahuatl. Anglophones likely corrupted it to rhyme with potato. The French, trust them, called it pommes damour (love apples), believing it had aphrodisiacal properties.Stop right there if you are reaching for one. Even without libidinal attributes, the price of this squishy everyday companion to cooking (along with onion) has already hit a new high in India, arousing ire. At Rs 70 a kilo last week, it surpassed the price of mangoes that are on their way out of the market. By this weekend, it had raced into record territory at Rs 100-plus a kilo.Famously, the rising price of tur daal and onion  our meat and potatoes  is something governments are leery of. But tomato is, by comparison, an orphan.Remember, it was only weeks ago that we read about tomato growers in distress  selling their produce at as low as one rupee a kilo or simply throwing it away in protest on highways in drama reminiscent of La Tomatina, the festival held in the town of Buol, Spain  sans the festivities. In fact, this appears to be as much an annual occurrence in parts of India  particularly in the districts of Nasik and Kolar, the biggest tomato-growing areas  as the Valencian festival. What gives?At first blush, it would seem the tomato is getting squished entirely by seasonal factors and market forces, like so much other agricultural produce in India  particularly fruits and vegetables  that does not get government support price. Growing tomatoes is particularly dicey, says Aruna Urs, a farmer-in-residence at the think-tank Takshashila Institution, comparing it to a Las Vegas crapshoot. Unseasonal rain or unexpected heat, a mandi strike or market glut, could be the difference between boom and bust.Over the years, farmers have learned to navigate the treacherous terrain  not always successfully  using seeds that yield thick-skinned tomatoes (for longevity and ease of transport) and timing the pick to market. Urs himself speaks of planting this April by car headlights in the dead of the night to catch the right temperature (too warm and the seeds die).The result has been a bonanza  Rs 68/kilo in the wholesale market last week when anything above Rs 10/kilo is considered rich pickings. So if farmers who got crushed by Rs 1/kg price during the market glut are making a killing at Rs 100 a kilo, who can blame them? By the way, stories about middlemen milking it are vastly exaggerated. They do, but not to the extent of some of the tomato crorepati farmers who gamble by leasing hundreds of acres in what is a high-wire  high-vine  act.Still, the price variation of 100x is not just a factor of seasons and market forces, but also of cultural and culinary habits. India is notoriously shy of eating frozen and canned goods. No self-respecting Indian would be caught using tomato that is in any way processed or pureed, sliced or diced, into a can or container. Thanks to vast tracts of arable and fecund lands, landing fresh produce is no problem in most parts of the country even if there is a groundwater crisis.By contrast, in the US, where tomato accounts for 22% of vegetable consumption (outside the technicality of it being a fruit), more than 50% of tomatoes are consumed as tomato products  processed, pureed, pasted etc. What did the papa tomato say to the baby tomato? A: Hurry and ketchup! goes the joke. Q: How do you get rid of unproductive tomatoes? A: Can them. As a result, retail price of tomatoes in the US has hovered between a low of $1.21 and a high $2.47 per pound over the last 20 years  nothing like the Rs 1 to Rs 100 variation in India.To be sure, theres enormous merit in the way Indians consume fresh produce, including the tomato in all its fiery colour and cool completeness (Pablo Neruda). Instead of eating fruits and vegetables in their original state, much of the West, particularly the US, soup them up with sodium and sugar, adding needless calories and subtracting dietary fibre. Last year, the grocery chain Whole Foods invited outrage and ridicule by selling pre-peeled oranges.But there is now sufficient research to show that frozen produce is not always nutritionally leached, and in some cases, enhances it. Sans sodium, canned is not dicey either. Of course, there is nothing to beat fresh, but as long as India does not accept enforced longevity of produce, both farmers and consumers will have to periodically deal with crapshoots in the fruit and vegetable market."

For years while the price of the aloo went up and down, Lalu survived the ups and downs of political life. He led the Bihar revolution, sending the caste elite to the political guillotine and promising equality for all Biharis. But some became more equal than others and began to sing saala main toh saheb ban gaya.He was always cheeky; like when he declared he would make Bihars roads as smooth as Hema Malinis cheeks. Now Lalus fortunes have run into those erstwhile bad roads of Bihar as investigators accuse him and his family of accumulating benami property. The Yadav patriarch has been the Bihari voters darling shepherd but the voting public no longer offers sheep-like loyalty.His supporters say that under the comic act, Lalu is a political genius, the joker who always aces the political poker game. He was the cowherd prince long before the Sanghs recent gau raksha drive, but now as CBI and ED investigate him, have the cows finally come home for Lalu? For Indian netas, politics is a family business and Lalu seems no exception. Thats why its always appeared that Indias social justice parties were only dispensing family-based injustice. Remember how Lalu once nominated his wife Rabri Devi as CM even as he administered his jagir from jail? That was a case of Bihar being imprisoned in family law.Investigators say Lalu and his children acquired vast amounts of land. Even though he was once son of the soil, and always had happy landings, now it looks as if the ground has shifted under his feet. Lalus tenure as railway minister was hailed by Harvard but it was that very tenure that appears to have derailed the Yadav wagon.Lalu named his daughter Misa after the notorious Emergency era law but is now suffering a family emergency even as son Tejashwi who played cricket for Delhi Daredevils could be caught and bowled. Its the agencies that are pressing charges, but Tejashwis supporters are attacking the press. Lalus most famous photo-op was the picture of him milking cows but hes now accused of milking the system. Even if Lalu survives this latest round of allegations, its time there was an image makeover for the Secular Undivided Family."

With wholesale markets in neighbouring states continuing to sell at exorbitant prices, vendors in Goa (who source their stock from there) have had no choice but to maintain the high prices.""Wholesale markets in Belagavi, Kolhapur, Pune and Bengaluru have received poor quantity of tomato produce from farms. This has forced them to hike rates urging us also to maintain the same. There will be no relief until this changes,"" said vendor Sadiq Shaikh.TOI had reported last week that poor rain in Maharashtra and Karnataka had led to a serious shortage in crop output. Resultantly leading to the low tomato produce and subsequent shortage.Weather parameters in Goa have also played foul for vendors in Goa. ""While supplying freshly-harvested tomatoes to the state, some of the stock got ruined after being hit by rains along Goa's ghats. Tomatoes unlike onions and potatoes cannot be hoarded and are easily perishable,"" said another vendor.They further added that rates will continue to remain high for another fortnight or so. Until then, tomatoes continue to be out of the common man's reach.Sharing his thoughts on the scenario, agriculture director Ulhas Pai Kakode said, ""Currently, there is low tomato stock in the market available for sale, therefore the exorbitant rates. Cultivation of the fresh crop has begun in June; which takes about 45 days to be ready. Once the quantity of tomatoes increases in the market, the rates will stabilize."""

The file has been sent to the CM and we hope the compensation will arrive soon,"" said state agriculture minister Purnendu Basu . The beneficiary will be those farmers who have lost 33% and more of their crop to inclement weather.The announcement was made on the day when knives were out for the BJP government over the farmers' killings in alleged police firing at Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh.Doling out of compensation isn't new in Bengal given that back in March 2015, to ease a crisis in potato cultivation, the state announced that 50,000 metric tonne of the crop would be directly procured from farmers in eight major potato-producing districts at the rate of Rs 5,500 per metric tonne and Rs 550 a quintal.The government then distributed them to schools for mid-day meals and ICDS beneficiaries at the rate of 1 kg per head per week.Till April 21, 2015, 20,000 metric tonne potatoes were procured and farmers were paid. The same year chief minister Mamata Banerjee requested the Centre to waive the crop loans to potato growers for the 2014-15 season and to arrange for fresh loans for the ensuing Kharif season.Since 2011, the Mamata Banerjee government, said sources, had been distributing agricultural input subsidy worth Rs 1,336.43 crore among 32.83 lakh farmers for damage of crops due to natural calamities under State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).Faced with disquiet in their states, the governments in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and now, Uttar Pradesh, have also adopted the route, though they have apparently not been able to reign in the crisis yet."

The committee led a coalition of over 150 farmers' organisations on the march from a village in Mandsaur where six farmers had been shot by the police last month.They had two specific demands: a one-time loan waiver to make them debt-free and remunerative prices for their crops.A poignant note was added to the event by a skit performed by the children of the farmers who had committed suicide. One such child, Ashok Patil, told the gathering: ""I am suffering because my father committed suicide. But I want to tell all the farmers of this country that suicide is not an option -- the only option is to fight for our rights.""The protest will continue tomorrow with a ""potato andolan"". Potatoes will be distributed for free to press home the demand for fair pricing.MP Raju Shetty, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader and one of the main organisers along with Swaraj Abhiyan's Yoginder Yadav , said: ""The Narendra Modi government had promised to waive the loans of farmers but later said it wasn't possible. We have not been told what's the alternative."" Shetty said he had campaigned for Modi expecting this promise to be fulfilled.Dr. Sunilam, moderator of the Sansad, demanded that action must be taken against the police officers who had shot the six farmers. Civil activist Prashant Bhushan added: ""The latest schemes of the government have become anti-farmer and pro-corporate. The government supports products such as GM mustard which benefit the corporates but destroy farming. The government also gives the corporates a lot of leeway with their debts which is not offered to the farmers.""""It is not the farmers that are under debt but the whole country that is under the debt of the farmers,"" said Yadav. ""We are not asking for a debt waiver but freedom from debt.""Social activist Medha Patkar, CPI-M leader Sitaram Yechury and Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant were among those who attended the protest."

Ever since, Pallavis mother has been working on other farms to make ends meet.Memories flash byI dont remember his face clearly, but there are moments that flash before my eyes.

What you dont realise is that this Rs. 1 can be the difference between his children eating dinner or going to bed hungry, said Pallavi as she broke down.She continued, You will never know how much the heart of a father pains when he has to disappoint his children everyday; till one day he cannot bear it any longer and decides to end everything.Many such children who have lost their fathers stay at an ashram in Nashik, away from their homes, because their families cannot afford their upbringing.Little did three-year-old Sanju, who was guarding an earthen pot covered with a red cloth and playing with other children around, realise that the pot contained the ashes of his father who had hung himself two weeks ago after local money lenders started threatening him to repay a loan of Rs. 50, 000.Farming is riskySanjus uncle Raghu Ram, who was accompanying him, said that he was too young to realise the gravity of the loss. He couldnt help but point out how Sanjus entire life would be affected by the death of his father, who was the sole breadwinner for their family of eight.Farming is becoming a risky job. We do not want our children to live the lives that we are living. The government should think about the children and their future and do something to save our lives, he added.Eight-year-old Hari from Solapur said that he wants to be an engineer and help his mother escape the life of poverty.My mother tells me that if I study well I can help our family build a big house and buy a car, he said.Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab had also joined the protest with sacks of potatoes, demanding fair prices for their produce.We make a profit of Rs. 5 after selling a sack of potatoes. How can we feed our families and afford a basic living with this? The government wants us to store our produce, but the cost of storing is much higher than the return, said Amir, who was leading the potato farmers from Uttar Pradesh.Former CM presentFormer Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijay Singh, who was also present at the protest, expressed his support for the farmers and their demands of remunerative crop prices and debt-free farming. This is the time to rise above party politics and support the farmers in their fight for justice, Mr. Singh said.We make a profit of Rs. 5 after selling a sack of potatoes.

Also, Mani Shankar Aiyar, senior Congress party leader joined the protest and blamed the union government for not addressing the demands of farmers. These poor people are wandering between Delhi and Chennai but not getting any decent answer, so they have again come here, Aiyar said.The children of famers who have committed suicide gathered again at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday and narrated their ordeal through a play. Describing their sufferings, Ashok Patil, one of the children said, A number of politicians have visited us in our Ashram and made a lot of promises. But all we get to see is a picture of the politician in the next days newspapers. Do they visit us to help us or to click selfies with us, he asked.On Wednesday farmers from Uttar Pradesh also raised their issues and said that government is unnecessarily putting financial burden on potato farmers asking them to keep the crop in cold storage without helping them financially. The government wants us to store our crop in cold storage. But the truth is that the price our crop fetches us is way less than the cost of keeping them in cold storage, Aamir, leader of potato farmers from Uttar Pradesh said.The protest was also addressed by a wife of a farmer from Tamil Nadu who committed suicide after he couldnt repay loan. She claimed that his husband committed suicide because he was harassed by the bank officials for not repaying the loan. The bank officials asked my husband how he was able to buy clothes for me if he was unable to repay his loans. Why is it always the poor who are humiliated, what about the rich that run away with crores of rupees? On Monday, at least a 100 farmers came back to the national capital for a second protest stint."

He said small and marginal traders were never subjected to tax before.According to him, the imposition of GST on the sector will make it uncompetitive.CPI(M) leader C P Narayanan demanded that items relating to the disabled people should removed from the GST net.Another CPI(M) member Ritabrata Banerjee spoke about the complexities in the new indirect tax regime which came into force from July 1.Rajeev Shukla of Congress said there was lack of coordination between the Centre and the states on the implementation of GST.Besides the problems facing the textile sector, members also raised issues relating to the floods in Assam and Odisha and farmers' problems.Digvijaya Singh of Congress said the condition of farmers was worsening and farmers' suicides have increased by 42 per cent during the NDA rule.He particularly highlighted the fall in prices of pulses, potato and onion. He has also sought a detailed discussion on the farmers issue.Raising the issue of floods in Assam, Congress member Sanjay Sinh demanded that the government should start relief measures on a war-footing and announce a package after assessing the damage.His party colleague Ripun Bora criticised the BJP-led state government saying it has not prepared any contingency plan for tackling the floods.BJD member Dilip Tirkey demanded special relief package for people affected by floods in certain districts of Odisha, including Kalahandi.Naresh Agrawal (SP) expressed concern over ""vulgar"" and misleading advertisments being aired on television channels.He said there should be regulations to check such advertisements to protect consumer interest.Veteran Congress leader Motilal Vora asked the government to construct good roads along the Indo-Pak border in Punjab saying these were in very bad condition.Another Congress member Viplove Thakur highlighted the plight of women, allegedly being brought to Haryana from different parts of the country for marriage as the state's sex ratio was bad.She demanded that the government should take steps on the issue seriously.Deputy Chairman P J Kurien asked Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs M A Naqvi to take note of it."

The Indian Express had earlier highlighted how farmers sold potatoes at 20 paise per kg at the Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra district. The situation was almost the same elsewhere in the state, too, as there was no mechanism to support the farmers  who were forced to opt for distress sale  even after a bumper potato crop.Khattar claimed that the government has fulfilled almost all the promises made by the BJP ahead of the Assembly polls. Transparency in recruitment for government jobs has been stated as one of his top achievements. It was painful when the youths had to look for sifarish for government jobs. We have changed that pattern to ensure jobs on merit, he said.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

Under the scheme, the premium to be paid by farmers is kept low and the claims are fully settled.Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Singh said the settlement of claims during the two years preceding 2016-17 remained higher because of bad weather (drought). But claims in 2016-17 were less on account of good rains.""If States feel they are burdened to pay their share of premium to private insurers (during good monsoon period when claims are normally less), then we have asked them to set up their own insurance firms to implement the scheme,"" he said, adding that Punjab and Gujarat have evinced interest in this.Replying to another query on the coverage of the PMFBY, the Minister said efforts were being made to bring more farmers under the scheme. Earlier, only loanee farmers were eligible for the crop insurance, now non-loanee farmers are also allowed. Last year, the crop insurance coverage was 30 per cent and it will be increased to 40 per cent this year, he added.Replying to another question on action taken to improve farmers' plight and reduce the number of farmers' suicide, the Minister said the government has revamped the old farm schemes and launched some new initiatives to reduce the cost of production and increase income.Admitting that farmers are in distress because of good production year, the Minister said the government is lending support to farmers through various market interventions to ensure support price to their produce. Farm produce like tur and potato are being procured under the central schemes -- Price Support Scheme (PPS) and the Price Stablisation Fund (PSF) to protect the interest of farmers, he added."

But what if you found an option where the more you drank, the less you paid? Thats exactly what Bar Bar in Phoenix Marketcity, Whitefield, has to offer. The concept works like this, the more people on the table, the lesser your bill gets. As you order more drinks, the price of each drink goes down - this applies to Indian and imported liquor.While this concept has been tried, tested and succeeded in Pune and Mumbai, it is relatively new in Bengaluru, as the outlet is less than a month old. Whats more, they even have an E-Savings Calculator App, which the team has been working on for 8 months now, and they are finally launching this patented software only in Bengaluru to begin with.The focus is to ensure that the customer is be able to see his savings at every step of the way during the ordering process.Coming to the decor, Bar Bar boasts of rustic interiors, mostly woodwork, a lot of barrels and some dim lighting to set the mood. The outdoor seating area is perfect for a chilly Bengaluru evening out with your friends.The food is better than what one would expect at a watering hole. We were spoilt for choice, and were not disappointed with anything we tried. The chicken wings, though a small portion, were flavourful and cooked just right - we tried the Bourbon Barbeque wings, and licked our fingers till every last bit of sauce came off.The Zucchini Parmesana, rings of zucchini and parmesan cheese fried and served with a dip, is an excellent option for vegetarians and cheese lovers. The seafood is excellent at Bar Bar. We tried the Butter Garlic Chilli Shrimp and the Baked Cheesy Masala Crab - both were fresh, very well spiced and cooked to perfection. For those coming in groups, the platters are the best option.Available in vegetarian, chicken, seafood and pork, these are large and can easily be shared by a group of four. We tried the pork platter, called the Oink Oink Platter, which came with pork made in at least five different ways, and is served with potato wedges and coleslaw. The highlight, for us, was the pizza. Made in a wood fire oven, the crust is thin and crunchy, with a generous doze of mozzarella. We tried different toppings on the same pizza, and can say that this is one of the better pizzas in town. For dessert, we tried the Salted Caramel and Expresso Tart - it was large, soft and sinful. And while dessert and drinks dont always go together, just visiting Bar Bar for a meal alone is also a good option.Coming to the drinks, we loved everything we tried. Bar Bar offers a 750 ml cocktail along with bar snacks for just `750 - ideal for one or two people. Under this, we tried Fruit Loops - a cocktail of tequila, cranberry juice, apple juice, candy and plenty of cut fruit, which was pink, pretty and quite potent. We also tried The Lynchburg - a cocktail made from orange whiskey, Vodka, Triple Sec and Ginger Ale  perfect for those whiskey lovers. The Grapejito  a mojito but with grape juice - is ideal for dark rum fans who are willing to experiment a little. With a wide range of drinks to offer and the stellar deals on offer, drinking at Bar Bar is a really fun experience, which is also not hard on your wallets. The music is lively, mostly pop, hip hop and rock numbers from the 1990s and the 2000s, but they also have the space for live gigs. The staff is courteous and polite, and the service is much quicker than expected.All in all, travelling to Whitefield just to visit Bar Bar, is definitely worth it.Cost for two: Rs 1,200"

""While the tomato is being sold for Rs 90 a kilo in the retail market, a farmer only gets 50 paise a kilo in the mandi.

Other vegetables are also drilling a hole in the pocket, with prices rising over the past 15 days. Prices are likely to increase further in coming days, said vegetable traders, adding that monsoon arrived late this year which led to poor crop of seasonal vegetables, while heavy rains later damaged the produce. Tomato was worst hit by rainfall in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.Seasonal vegetables hit by unfavourable weather conditions include brinjal, ladyfinger, bitter gourd, colocasia and potatoes. Cost of bottle guard, pumpkin, pointed guard and cauliflower has dropped up to 40%.Wholesale dealer Shahikant Singh said, ""Rains damaged the tomato crop in Karnataka and also affected its transport."" Another wholesale dealer Kripal said, ""The supply has yet to normalise, hence cost of tomato and other vegetables will increase further.""Vegetables that have become cheaper are those which are grown locally or within the state. There was a glut since the produce could not be sent to other states because of heavy rains, so their prices went down. Also, these vegetables don't have a long shelf life, so vendors are selling them for less.Housewife Pooja Rastogi said, ""The hike in prices of tomato and potato is pinching most as there is hardly any dish one can make without these two. I have started using readymade tomato puree, 1kg of which costs between Rs 70-90, whereas raw tomato is at over Rs 100 per kg.""

295,Now  vegetables off the menu,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-vegetables-off-the-menu/article19353339.ece,2017-07-25,The Hindu,"A bag of vegetables is fast slipping out of the ambit of a budget kitchen.Rising price of vegetables is affecting most of the consumers as there is little alternative for vegetables, says V. Gomathi of Periyar Nagar in Erode. Dependence on non-vegetarian food has increased in the past one month from weekly once to thrice. We have to work on cost cutting measures for a balanced budget, she says.From tomatoes and small onions to even the fresh greens, prices of most vegetables are up across the region. It is the result of a combination of factors, say farmers, traders, and officials. Failure of monsoon last year and demonetisation had an impact on sowing, they say.Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris are among the main horticulture crop growing centres in the State.Over 3,500 hectares are under tomato crop in the blocks of Mecheri, Kaadayampatti, Omalur, Pethanayakkanpalayam, Attur in Salem district. Small onion is raised in more than 4,000 hectares in Namakkal district and about 700 hectares in the Kolathur, Vazhappadi and Gangavalli blocks in Salem district.Repeated failure of monsoon resulted in standing crops withering in many parts, leading to fall in the arrival in the uzhavar santhais and open markets, say officials in Salem and Namakkal.Three kg of tomato was priced at Rs. 10 in May and now it is Rs. 60 - Rs. 64 a kg. During the peak season period, the uzhavar santhais used to receive about seven tonnes of tomatoes every day. Currently, about five tonnes of tomatoes reach the market.Following the commencement of small onion harvesting season in Salem District, there has been reasonable increase in the arrival of onion stock from the villages. The price of small onion which stood at more than Rs. 100 per kg last month, has come down. The price of good quality small onion stood at Rs. 84 and the second quality onion at Rs. 80 at the Salem Uzhavar Santhai on Sunday. The prices of tomatoes and small onions are expected to stabilise in the Salem wholesale markets once arrivals start from the nearby cultivation pockets.The shortage of rainfall and demonetisation seem to have played into the cropping area in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts. Bathalahalli is the largest wholesale market that attracts traders from across the State and sends vegetables to Kerala too. The general fall in production of vegetables in Thally, Denkanikottai, Hosur and Rayakottai  whose farmers are the largest suppliers of cabbage, tomatoes, beans, carrots, beets, is one of the reasons for the price rise. The supply has fallen, but the demand has increased, say traders.President of Traders Association of Bathalahalli market Raja Reddy says the number of trucks loading vegetables is between 80 to 100 tonne on any day and it has remained almost the same, subject to availability of vegetables. The price of most vegetables range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg. Beans has been going at Rs. 50 per kg for the last 6 months, he says. This year, tomato cultivation fell significantly. Its price at the market is Rs. 70 per kg, he adds. Normally, June- August witness a rise in tomato prices largely coinciding with the fall in the vegetables production in other growing regions of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The 70-day crop was hit right when demonetisation came. Farmers, who were already mid-way into the crop and awaiting harvest, were hit. To cut down on costs, the area of cultivation was also reduced, says a Rayakottai-based farmer.In the Nilgiris, though the prices of vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes remains extremely high, English vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, beans and beetroot, which are produced in large quantities in the Nilgiris, have not seen a steep hike in prices.According to Raja Mohammed, a wholesale vegetable supplier, the wholesale rate of broccoli currently is Rs. 130 per kg., while carrots are sold for anywhere between Rs. 35-40 per kg. depending on the quality and freshness of the produce. Beetroot is also selling for between Rs. 28 to Rs. 35 per kg., which is the usual price that these vegetables are sold for during this season.The price of English vegetables increase only during the wedding season, when they are purchased in large quantities for feasts, he says. Though the prices of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are still high, there has not been a major demand for cheaper alternatives, said other vegetable sellers in the Ooty Municipal Market.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

The reason they cite is illegal occupation of some sheds in the wholesale market because of which several tomato traders have been sitting on a dharna.""We have been protesting for the past six days and met labour minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday, asking that the illegal occupation of our sheds be stopped. However, we have been given no assurances and on Friday, we will go on strike,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of the vegetable traders' association.On Tuesday, about 2,000-2,500 tonnes of tomatoes arrived at the mandi against a normal arrival of about 12,000-16,000 tonnes. Sources said there was a country-wide shortage of tomatoes due to heavy rain in several states and only produce from Himachal Pradesh was reaching Delhi. ""Tomatoes sold for Rs 70-80 per kg in the mandi on Tuesday, which means that in the retail market, one can expect prices to rise to Rs 110 or even Rs 120 in the coming two-three days,"" warn a trader.While the shortfall was expected, the agitation by tomato traders has resulted in an even lesser arrival of tomatoes, said Metha Ram Kriplani, another trader. ""On July 20, APMC issued notices to companies that have illegally occupied seven tomato sheds and two sheds of mausambi. That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid. The same exercise had to be carried out with the potato and onion traders as well,"" he added."

Farmers are unable to reap the benefits and consumers are feeling the pinch.As farmers cant sit for an entire day in the market to sell their produce, they sell the harvest in wholesale market at a price demanded by the middlemen.Middlemen get a maximum of 70% and minimum of 50% profit for the tomatoes brought by farmers. Seeing the demand for tomatoes, middlemen and retailers have hiked the prices. Few farmers said middlemen decide the price to a large extent.We toil in fields but the profits are taken away by others. As tomatoes cant be kept for more than three days, we have to sell it at the best available price, said a farmer in Dharwad.We sell a basket of 8kg tomatoes for about `350-`450. We also have to pay for transportation and labour charges. But in the retail market, the same tomato is being sold at `100 per kg. We sell tomatoes to middlemen as they take the entire quantity at one go, he added.Horticulture Department deputy director S B Diddimani said, Vegetable prices go up every year. But this year, the prices have gone too high. They may come down and get stabilised in another 15 days.Scarcity of rain and decrease in sowing areas are the reasons for price hike. Once tomatoes from districts like Belagavi and Kolar start arriving in the city market, the burden of price hike will be eased, he added.The middlemen at the APMC yard say they are blamed whenever the prices go up. Many retailers buy produce on credit. We pay labour charges to distribute the vegetables. We hardly get `50 to `60 profit a basket, they said.Potato farmers in Hassan a worried lotHassan: Potato farmers in Hassan are a worried lot as they incurred crop loss consecutively for five years. Moreover, the growing area of potato by small and medium farmers has been drastically decreased from 61,000 hectares to 10,087 in 10 years. Statistics available with Express show that small farmers who cultivate on less than five acres have switched over to alternative crops like maize and ginger due to crop loss. On the other hand, the farmers who are cultivating on more than five acres have leased out their land to Ginger growers. Horticulture officials are anxious as the certified seeds supplied by the department in 1,266 hectares were damaged due to dry spell. The department had brought the certified seeds from Punjab and supplied it to 2,094 farmers at a subsidised rate.The officials had promised compensation if crop loss was reported, but no action has been initiated so far.Dilemma of Tomato GrowersEvery acre approximately needs 50 gram tomato seeds and after seeds start sprouting, they will be planted. Seeds will cost approximately D450 for 50Fertilizers worth D18,000 is used for one acre of tomato growing fieldIf everything goes fine, 400-500 baskets of tomatoes will be harvested from an acreTransportation costs are extra and labour charge is D150 per day"

Traders have warned of a further increase in price if their protests continue.Two sections of growers, each accusing the other of having occupied the sheds illegally, have been sitting on dharnas at the wholesale market for a week. The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) had issued a notice to one section on July 20, saying ""it has come to our notice that the following firms have illegally put up their boards at some tomato sheds even as they have no permission from APMC Azadpur, nor has there been any change made by the Tomato Traders Association"". The notice gives them three days after its receipt to remove their boards.""If APMC has issued them notices for illegal occupation , why is the government bent upon reallocation of sheds.

Mantri added that vehicular movements on Ranchi-Lohardaga and Ranchi-Daltonganj routes were as badly hit. Suresh Kumar, who drives a bus on Ranchi-Daltonganj stretch, said a portion of a small bridge near Pakhria in Chanho on NH-75 was witnessing erosion. ""Portions of the bridge have become very narrow, leading to long snarls. More rain can snap this link too,"" he said. On Ranchi-Hazaribagh-Patna route (NH-33), a landslide threat has emerged near Chuttupalu valley in Ramgarh after heavy rain loosened boulders. The Ranchi-Bokaro road via Sikidiri and Ranchi-Silli road are also out of bounds owing to flooding of a bridge and road cave-in in Silli two days ago. Sunil Chauhan, vice-president of Ranchi Goods Transporters Association, said consignments from Bengal had remained affected for two-three days. ""Potatoes, vegetables and flowers come from Bengal and other states to Ranchi via Baharagora, and this link has taken a beating. Vegetable prices are likely to rise,"" Chauhan said, adding that roughly 100 trucks brought essential items to Ranchi and more than 50 were stranded. A senior official of a retail supermarket chain said for three days now, they were facing crisis of vegetables. ""Our stocks come from Silli and Gola, but many roads and bridges have been washed away along the route, and there is no supply. In Brambe (on Ranchi's outskirts), where we do bulk procurement, local markets are closed owing to incessant rain. We are somehow managing with vegetables bought from Pithoria,"" he said, adding that almost all their outlets in Ranchi and Jamshedpur were facing the crunch. ""For our 50-odd stores in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, we require 10 tonnes of vegetables a day, but are doing with less than half the stocks."" The humble potato will soon be too hot to handle, the supermarket official warned. ""Potatoes mostly come from Bengal. As per norms, they are first dried after being taken out of cold storage before being dispatched. Heavy rain in Bengal has hit stocks,"" he said. In retail markets, the price of tomato has shot up to Rs 120 notwithstanding the state food and civil supplies department's order to FJCCI to cap the rate at Rs 80. Green vegetables like beans and cauliflower are acting pricey too. Beans are selling at Rs 30 per 250gm while a small cauliflower also has a price tag of Rs 30.

With prices hovering around Rs 100/kg since about a fortnight now, the humble tomato  which is scientifically a fruit but commonly known as a vegetable owing to its rampant use in cooking savoury rather than sweet meals  is giving a fright to the common man. While vendors at some of the local markets claim that the price hike is due to interrupted supply because of the rains, those in the food business are among the worst hit. With tomato prices going through the roof, many are resorting to substitutes like canned puree and ketchup, leading to their dwindling stocks at various departmental stores.Gurleen Singh, owner of Hindusthan Dhaba , said they are bearing a loss of 3-4% at the moment. ""We are hoping that the situation will get better in the coming weeks. If the crisis persists, we will be forced to increase the price of our dishes by `5-`10 on an average,"" he said, explaining that gravy items, especially makhnis, are cooked with fresh tomatoes. However, Rahul Arora, proprietor of Paranthe Wali Galli , said their business remains unaffected as they don't use fresh tomatoes and cook with tomato puree instead.""We get our stock of canned tomato puree and since the price of that has not increased, we are not feeling the pinch,"" he told us. Chef Rangan Niyogi seconded Rahul as he said tomato puree is indeed a preferred ingredient in Indian kitchens. ""Readymade tomato puree is a great help in times of crisis. It can be used for churning out a variety of dishes. Generally, we use fresh tomatoes in numerous Indian dishes, like chicken butter masala, dal makhni, methi saag, aloo dum etc. But, currently I am using tinned tomato puree in place of fresh tomatoes and Kashmiri mirch in place of red chilli powder to make them taste close to tomato. However, in case of tomato chutney, it's not possible to substitute fresh tomatoes. For making tomato or minestrone soup, I am using carrot and tomato puree in place of fresh tomato. While carrot lends the vegetable flavour, tomato puree helps in getting the right taste and colour of the soup,"" he said.According to local vendors, tomato prices shooting up during this season is a common occurrence as rains spoil the stock. Tomatoes that have a shelf life of 3-4 days are hard to stock up at a time not many farmers have access to cold storage. Chef Joymalya Banerjee , however, feels the crisis is ""created"". ""Monsoon comes every year and it's not believable that the entire stock got ruined due to exceptional rains. Yet, there's a dearth in supply. So, if I ask vendors to deliver 5 kilos, they are giving only 2 kilos. This has been happening for the past two weeks,"" he said. The chef added that he doesn't believe in passing the burden on to the consumers. ""Everyone in the restaurant business keeps a buffer. For example, if the making cost of a dish is `10, it's sold at `30. For the loss of a rupee or so, it's not feasible to hike the price of a dish. There was a time when potato prices were hiked to an extent that some biryani makers dropped the aloo from the dish. That was juvenile, as it's not fair to victimise consumers all the time. I will hike the prices only when I can't bear the burden anymore,"" he reasoned.Though tomato prices started coming down on Wednesday and were available at `80 a kilo at some places, online grocery platforms such as Big Basket and Grofers continued to sell the kitchen must at over `100 a kilo. It was `109 a kilo at Big Basket and `110 a kilo at Grofers on Thursday. Cherry tomatoes and the organic variety came at `280 and `172.50 a kilo respectively."

The protest is against the government's decision to reallocate tomato sheds with a section of traders blaming another group of illegal occupation of these facilities.""About 85-90% of the mandi is likely to be shut. Some commission agents may continue to operate but almost everyone has promised to join in. We informed growers about Monday's strike last week. Trucks that were due to arrive at the mandi on Sunday night or early Monday won't come,"" said Metha Ram Kriplani, a vegetable trader.Last week, after meeting both groups that have been blaming each other of encroachment, development minister Gopal Rai had announced that the reallocation would be done based on the market fees submitted by traders over the past three years.""There is a cartel that needs to be broken. The government had earlier seen a similar problem with onion and potato traders and was successful in breaking those,"" said a senior official. As far as Monday's strike is concerned, he said, it is being done by a small section of traders and the government is not anticipating any severe disruption.The section of traders that has called the strike said the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) had sent a notice to the other side, saying they should vacate seven tomato and three mausambi sheds that they had illegally occupied. ""If there was a genuine misunderstanding, why would APMC issue them the notice? It is a clear proof that even the government found those traders in the wrong. In that case, why is there a reallocation of sheds?"" asked a trader.The strike, if it is as severe as traders claim it would be, may impact availability of fruits and vegetables and their price. The city is already witnessing a sharp rise in prices of tomatoes and onions due to reduced supply during the monsoon."
302,Decline in potato cultivation on Kodaikanal hills,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/decline-in-potato-cultivation-on-upper-kodaikanal-hills/article19423601.ece,2017-08-04,The Hindu,"Potatoes are now being cultivated only in small areas on upper Kodaikanal hillsPHOTO: G. KarthikeyanAcute drought owing to failure of the southwest monsoon has left thousands of potato growers on upper Kodaikanal hill in distress.With no rain till July end, potato growers in Gundupatti, Mannavanur, Klavarai and nearby villages on the hill have left their land barren. This has led to a sharp decline in the total area under potato cultivation.A few traditional potato growers, who have little ground water source, have shifted to garlic, which requires less water and maintenance. But they too are struggling to protect the standing crop.The district received 3.06 mm rain in July, 90% less than the normal rainfall of 30.6 mm. The situation was the same in June.Rain water is a must to energise potato crop, which grows on slopes. We should have sown the seeds after the first showers of this monsoon, said S. Sivakumar of Gundupatti village, 45 km away from Kodaikanal town. Periodical showers since sowing are also essential to protect the crop. Shortage of rain will affect size and quality of the potato.Potato cultivation is a costly affair, he added. We had to invest heavily. Seeds are imported from Mettupalayam. The price of a seed bag cost Rs. 5,000. At least, we need 10 bags to raise the crop in one acre.Farmers had a better yield two years ago, with the procurement price at Rs. 25 a kg. We hired trucks and mini lorries in Kodaikanal town to transport potato to the market, he recalled.Sivakumar suffered a huge loss of Rs. 9 lakh last year because of drought. Each farmer had to shell out at least Rs. 1 lakh to raise potato crop. The yield should have been at least 400 bags, each 45 kg, to get reasonable returns. But it was less than 20 kg. The crops withered completely. By this time, sowing should have been over. But it is barren now, he rued.Several acres of land, traditionally under potato cultivation, in Gundupatti remain barren. Not even 10% of the potato growers have raised the crop this year. Similar situation prevails in other potato growing centres on Upper Kodaikanal. The hill station has been reeling under drought for the second consecutive year. Scanty rain haunts Kaunji, another major potato production centre.However, farmers, who have little ground water source in Kookal panchayat, have shifted to garlic. Despite the drought, those who had managed to harvest garlic last year enjoyed good returns. They too are struggling to protect the standing crop today.Talking to The Hindu , Horticulture Officer Shiny Divya said: Farmers may go for sowing till September or even October. Sharp showers in the last 48 hours may cheer them to sow. But delay in rain will affect quality of crop."

The restaurant has introduced a new menu that includes signature Italian dishes and exotic ingredients. For starters, we were served Fungi misti e Formaggi, Chicken crostini and Calamari, acciughe e fritti di Gamberi.Fungi misti e Formaggi is a platter of mushrooms mixed with fresh greens, walnuts, broccoli and cheese. It has the nutty flavour of walnuts, bitterness of blanched broccoli and the earthy flavour of grilled mushrooms, and comes with an Italian dressing. The Chicken crostini has grilled pesto chicken, olives, onions, bell peppers on a crunchy Tuscan bread served with mixed greens. The olives neutralises the cheese. Smothered in a creamy, basil pesto, it brings out the char-grilled taste of the chicken. It serves as a comfort food.The Calamari in Calamari acciughe e fritti di Gamberi is crunchy and chewy. The crispy soft prawns in the platter goes well with the dip. It is served with french fries and salad. To cleanse our palate, an intermediate course of fruit sorbets topped with mint leaves are served. Next comes the main course. The Risotto aifunghi misti e porri has mushrooms blended with leek risotto prepared with truffle oil. Warm and starchy, it is healthy and makes you feel good. It's a dish that you can have during the rains. The Chicken scaloppini has thinly sliced chicken breast with truffle-flavoured mushroom wine butter sauce, grilled mushroom, tomato and buttered creamy spinach.The platter has garlic mashed potatoes and rosemary grilled veggies that includes broccoli, beans and cauliflower. The mashed potato is a favourite. Even people who do not prefer potatoes, would love it. It has a dominant pungent taste of garlic.The Burro di Dory e aranciapan is a fried polenta crusted John Dory fish with lemon couscous, spaghetti of vegetables, tomato salsa and orange butter sauce. The dish is not bad but it did not meet our expectations.The fish looks crunchy but is not. The vegetables in the noodles adds crunch to the dish. It has grainy Mediterranean khus khus. The desserts are the highlight. The Salted Vanilla Cheese Cake is the best of the lot. It looks so colourful and appealing that you don't want to disturb the presentation. Served with ice cream, the cheesecake platter also has strawberry sauce. Most Americans prefer to have the cheesecake topped with this sauce.But, people here might not take to it and, hence, it is served on the side. The Chocolate, Banana crepe is nice. The thin crepe is smooth. It is caramelised right. The chocolate sauce does not overpower the taste of the banana. It is served with almond Praline and Vanilla ice cream. The Strawberry and Chocolate Ganache Tart has crumbs of red velvet. It is buttery. The outer layer of the tart, made of bisuits, adds a creamy crunch to it. Cost for two: `1,500"
304,Trial by taste,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/trial-by-taste/article19431393.ece,2017-08-05,The Hindu,"Its been raining biryani. Our friends had called us over, but I  down with a nasty bug  couldnt make it. So they packed for me a big consignment of biryani from Behrouz. You may recall that I wrote about Behrouzs biryani once. It had been delivered home even before we could say gosht, and I remember how I enjoyed their kofta biryani  peppered with little mince balls.The friends generous package carried us over the weekend. And it also reminded me of the biryani that I had eaten just a few days before that  at the Press Club of India.The Club had a biryani festival. And I had some exceptional biryani there. I discovered that the biryani had been catered especially for the club by the Corporate Master Chef of the Clarks Inn Group of Hotels, Sunil Soni, and his able assistant, Junaid, who comes from a bawarchi family of Aligarh.I know biryani lovers are the most quarrelsome group that you can ever find in India, perhaps even more than mango aficionados who can never agree on what could be crowned as the king of the fruit. Likewise, those who like their Hyderabadi kachchey gosht biryani have nothing but scorn for the Awadhi biryani fan club, which, in turn, thinks the Kolkata biryani lovers should get their heads examined. And then there are those who know and love their south Indian biryanis, and shrug and say, Oh these northerners.I think the time has come to judge the biryani not just by its origins, but by the taste. Not everybody who does kachchey gosht ki biryani does it well, and some of the so-called Kolkata biryani outlets in Chittaranjan Park should be told that one potato does not maketh a Kolkata biryani. The true test lies in how good the biryani tastes.And the ones that had been prepared by Soni, Junaid and their men were simply outstanding. I had some of the Hyderabadi gosht biryani and Awadhi chicken biryani. Both were finger-licking good, and that was the unanimous opinion of our four-member household.One reason, of course, was the rice, which was of exceptional quality  long-grained and aromatic, as well as cooked to perfection, which each grain occupying its own glistening space. The meat had been cooked and spiced just right. The rich flavours came from the yakhni  stock  that had been used while the rice was being cooked. And Chef Soni tells me that some stock was also used while the meat  chicken or lamb  was being marinated with spices.The flavours of the biryanis had been enhanced with a touch of pan ki jad, which is powdered and added to the dish, and ittar. And the mildly sweet flavour came from rose petals and plump raisins.I also had the most delicious dessert I have eaten in recent times. Its called gulatthi, and is prepared with thickened milk, khoya, nuts and a bit of saffron. Unlike phirni, it doesnt have rice in it. So the flavours and texture come from the nuts and the khoya. This is a dish that is especially popular in the Aligarh-Rampur area.The biryani at the club was offered at subsidised rates, but Chef Soni (9810380519) and his team can cater for large parties, where a plate of biryani may cost Rs. 400-500, depending on the number of people and other such factors.Now that in every corner of the city you have someone selling some kind of biryani, the dish has been losing its appeal because of the substandard offerings in many of these places. These days, for instance, the moment I see a sign that says Moradabadi Biryani, I am reminded of the flavour of pickle in the rice. And let me tell you its not a happy thought.But this biryani has strengthened my belief that there are unknown jewels still waiting to be discovered. Seek, and we shall find."
305,"Meat lovers, go armed with knives and use your fingers",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/aug/05/meat-lovers-go-armed-with-knives-and-use-your-fingers-1638716.html,2017-08-05,The New Indian Express,"BENGALURU: Here, non-vegetarians would be faced with a Herculean task, because there are too many options. The new menu, which is for only a month at Smoke House Deli, offers six varieties of meats. There is the one Roasted Chicken and Classic Sauce Supreme and Potato Cake, which is served with potato, mushroom, tomato, cream and cheese. Chicken is juicy, abounding in creamy flavours of mushroom while the skin remains delightfully crisp.The potato cake layered with thin slices and sandwiching cheese and egg oozes, when cut, to compliment the fibrous chicken. Boiled tomato gives the meal an acidic twist. Grilled Rib Eye steak, with beef, is served with carrots and asparagus tossed in butter. The ribs are directly grilled without marination so the mild flavour of the meat is retained. Sauce Robert, a brown mustard sauce, is poured over the beef and the brown sauce tastes sharply of onion and butter, the two primary ingredients of Sauce Robert.The meat is hard and chewy, with a sour cream topping the taste balances out. Now onto the Pan Grilled Quail served with Spaghetti Chicken Bolognaise; expect an attractive presentation. The roasted quail nestles on classic spaghetti. The first bite is smoky and bitter and the taste lingers to turn sweeter. Quail tastes like chicken but the flavour is stronger. Minced chicken tossed in spaghetti and harmonised with zesty red wine makes this delectable.Almost similar in style but distinct in flavour is the Pan-seared breast of Duck and Soya Chilli Noodles that bursts with flavours of chilli and garlic. The tangy orange sauce has been tossed with noodles along with chunks of orange. Over this is placed glazed and juicy duck meat. The salad served to the side has lettuce, barley and duck feet, a refreshingly new combination.Besides the bird variety, Crumbed Lamb Cutlets and Mint Pesto is another surprise because this is the only meat in the menu that is fried in butter and not grilled. Caramalised, juicy and crisp, the lamb is cooked to perfection. Grilled Fresh Pork Chops with Home-made Hash Brown is shallow-grilled pork ribs and is medium-rare. The chewy and salty flavour of the pork meshed well with smokey cake-like Hash Brown. Cost for two: `2,000"

RamakrishnaG._RamakrishnaVegetable prices in the city have soared owing to poor rainfall last month and late arrival of loads from other states and districts. While rates of common vegetables and tubers including tomatoes and potatoes increased by 50% in supermarkets in the city, rythu bazaars too witnessed a 30% hike in prices.On Monday, tomatoes price in a Punjagutta-based hypermart was at Rs. 70 per kilo, while the corresponding price at rythu bazaar was Rs. 60 per kilo. The price of tomatoes in the last week of July was Rs. 50 per kilo. Similarly, baby potato was priced at Rs. 45 per kilo whereas it was Rs. 30 per kilo for the regular variety.Vegetables including ladies fingers and beans were very costly on Monday, with the former priced at Rs. 69 per kilo and the latter Rs. 112 per kg. Onion price, however, was at a constant of Rs. 30 per kilo in supermarkets and rythu bazaars.The weekly budget of most households have gone up, thanks to the price rise even as families tried to minimise spending. In July, there was a sudden price rise which dipped marginally in the last week. But again in August, prices have gone up with essential vegetables costing more than their prices in July, said Venkat Reddy, a resident of Rethibowli, who came to shop at rythu bazaar in Mehdipatnam.Homemakers who manage the household budget said that they have had to make do with lesser vegetables to balance out. We end up buying more tubers than fresh greens. It causes inconvenience to ageing parents who need vegetables more than protein rich tubers, said Vanaja Laxmi of New Mallepalli Colony.Farmers, who brought their produce to the rythu bazar, however, said that their returns declined with consumers buying less than usual.There is a shortage of tomatoes and beans due to poor rains. And then with rains, transportation and storage became a problem, said N. Nagamani, a vegetable seller in Mehdipatnam.Due to fall in prices at the procurement end, several farmers had to dump their produce including rich harvest of tomatoes last month, she said.As the month progresses, the prices are expected to dip as more produce will come from other states including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, agriculturists predicted.Usually the month of August is when the prices dip with fresh harvest coming in. It has not happened so far but soon there will be a fall, said Sarampally Mallareddy from Communist Party of Indias farmers collective."
307,From plate to plough: Plan for the agri-futures,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/plan-for-the-agri-futures-e-nam-farmer-produce-market-4795368/,2017-08-14,Indian Express,"The e-NAM aims to create an all-India spot market by creating an electronic platform. (Representational image) The e-NAM aims to create an all-India spot market by creating an electronic platform. (Representational image)Even after 70 years of Independence, the marketing system for agri-products remains un-supportive to farmers. They cant discover and realise the best prices possible for their produce across space and time as markets are not sufficiently integrated. They sell in local markets where prices bust in case of bumper harvests, as happened in the last few months, not only for potatoes and onions but also for most pulses and oilseeds. The e-NAM aims to create an all-India spot market by creating an electronic platform.However, for transactions to take place across mandis and states, one has to do much more than installing a simple software. It needs assaying, grading, sorting, storing, delivering and settling disputes with respect to each transaction. Despite the good concept of e-NAM, creation of an all-India spot market for farmers is still at least five years away, if not more. If the government wants to do it faster, there could be some lessons from Indias nascent and Chinas well-developed futures markets.The agri-futures market is one way to ensure that farmers planting and selling decisions are forward-looking, and not based on past prices. This can help smoothen the typical boom and bust problem in agri-prices. However, there are two key problems with Indian agri-futures: One, they are often disrupted by sudden bans or suspensions by the government as many policy-makers have a deep mistrust in the functioning of these markets; and two, very few farmers or farmer producer organisations (FPOs) trade on futures, which in turn reinforces the mistrust of policymakers. No wonder, the overall size of agri-futures in India remains trapped at low levels, and the most worrying part is that since 2012, it has been tumbling down (see Figure-1). Although the onus of reviving this trend largely lies with agri-commodity exchanges and the regulator, it may be worth looking at the Chinese experience in this context, and see if anything useful can be learnt.Interestingly, India recorded the first trade in futures in 1875 in cotton in the Bombay Cotton Exchange, just 10 years after the first trade was consummated in USA. But Indias agri-futures could not develop much due to a series of suspensions around the Second World War in view of the shortage of essential commodities. This mindset continued post-Independence, and only pepper and turmeric were allowed to trade in 1977. However, it was the bold vision of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that in 2003 three national exchanges were set up and all commodities were allowed to be traded in futures markets. But since 2003, 15 commodity futures were suspended, leading to uncertainty in the market. Despite there being sufficient evidence that spot prices broadly converge with future prices, there remains a mistrust in commodity futures amongst policymakers. No wonder, agri-futures remained at low levels, forming only 2 per cent of 1.6 billion global agri- futures contracts during the triennium average ending (TE)-2016.In comparison, look at China, which started in the early 1990s, and by TE 2016, it was the largest player in global agri-futures contracts with a whopping share of 69 per cent. (Figure 2). What is the secret of Chinese success? China also did a lot of experimentation in the early years, starting as many as 33 commodity exchanges in 1993, but many of them had to be shut down by 1998, and several commodities suspended. One of the key lessons that China learnt from CBOT experts of the US was that a spot or wholesale market of sufficient size and efficiency has to be developed before establishing a vibrant futures market.The other takeaways from the Chinese success in agri-futures are: One, state participation in the futures markets through the State Trading Enterprises; two, no abrupt suspensions of commodities; and three, focus on choice of commodities, which are not very sensitive from the food security point of view. As one can see in Figure 2, the Chinese volume of contracts is much higher in soya, mustard, and corn complexes, which are basically for feed. Palm oil, sugar, cotton and rubber are other commodities that China imports in large volumes, and they are not part of the core food security basket.So, what is the lesson for our regulator and commodity exchanges? The key lesson is: Pick the commodities carefully, and deepen their markets first. SEBI has tried to come up with some indicative criteria in the choice of commodities to be developed for futures markets, but the basic distinction between feed and food commodities is missing. And it is here that the Chinese experience is relevant as they first tried to develop futures in commodities that are non-sensitive from the food security point of view.In this context, in a larger paper with Siraj Hussain, former Secretary, Agriculture, we carried out a Principal Component Analysis taking several commodity parameters into account with a view to identifying the most promising commodities for futures markets. Our results show that commodities with the highest potential for futures trading are either feed material (soybean meal, rapeseed meal, maize) or fibre (cotton), followed by spices and edible oils. Basic staple food items like rice, wheat, and even pulses get a low ranking due to their food security concerns. India being now the largest importer of edible oils, especially palm and soya oils, these are promising candidates for agri-futures provided global players are allowed to trade in these.It is thus obvious that a well thought-out strategy to pick the right commodities is a better way to develop agri-futures rather than a frequent stop-go policy. The trust in commodity futures will enhance once more FPOs start trading on agri-futures, and they start gaining directly or indirectly from agri-futures. SEBI can help incentivise the participation of FPOs on the futures trading platform, but the real onus lies with agri-commodity exchanges, and it is here that the progress has been extremely slow.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Retail inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was revised downwards to 1.46 per cent for June.It is also a reflection of monthly kitchen costs, which continued to remain soft, with prices showing gradual improvement at (-) 0.29% from (-) 2.12 per cent in June against 8.35 per cent in the same period last year.The fall in food inflation has been brought about by disinflation in the prices of mainly pulses and vegetables, which is assessed to be a stabilising factor.Vegetable prices fell by (-)3.57 per cent in July compared with (-)16.53 per cent in June, prices of pulses fell (-)24.75 per cent, against (-)21.92 per cent in June. Prices of foods and beverages became costly by 0.43 per cent against (-)1.17 per cent growth. While fuel inflation was 4.84 per cent in June, against 5.46 per cent in May and data shows that housing inflation remained nearly flat, growing 4.98 per cent in July from 4.7 per cent in June.Higher food articles and vegetable prices have pushed up wholesale inflation for July by 1.88 per cent, compared to 0.9 per cent in June. Wholesale inflation was low in July last year at 0.63 per cent.Food prices of pulses, potatoes and onions experienced a free fall as a result of a supply glut. Vegetable prices were up 22 per cent in July as a result of a hike in tomato prices.The heavy rains and delay in crop arrival to the mandi/markets made it costly for the consumers as the prices grew by 25.47 per cent in June. However, the broad conditions for agri-prices remain conducive given normal monsoon in most parts of the country and stable global commodity prices. This outlook is also corroborated in the second part of the Economic Survey released last week, said Pankaj Patel, president, FICCI.The wholesale price index data shows the doubling in the rate of inflation in July was mainly on account of a turnaround in prices of food article, especially vegetables."
309,‘Climate change may reduce rice output in Punjab’,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/climate-change-may-reduce-rice-output-in-punjab/articleshow/60065923.cms,2017-08-15,The Times Of India,"CHANDIGARH: While the global climate change is expected to reduce production of rice in Punjab and Haryana, at the same time it is likely to increase potato output in the two states. The changing climate is also expected to experience negative impact on milk production in the region, predicts the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture in its report tabled in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.The report says that the climate change would surge production of potato in Punjab, Haryana and western and central Uttar Pradesh by 3.46% to 7.11% by 2030, but in rest of India potato production may decline by 4% to 16%.The 31-member committee, headed by Bihar MP and former Union minister of state Hukumdev Narayan Yadav of BJP, also submitted that irrigated rice in north-west India comprising Haryana and Punjab is projected to reduce by 6% to 8% by 2020. Whereas in other parts of the country the loss would be below 5%.Northern India, including Punjab and Haryana, is expected to experience more negative impact of climate change on milk production, the committee has found. It would be higher in crossbreds (0.63%) followed by buffaloes (0.5%) and indigenous cattle (0.4%).The committee noted that studies indicate that changing climate will decrease yields in major crops like wheat, rice and maize. On the other hand, the impact could be neutral to positive in crops like groundnut, soybean and chickpea. More number of generations of insect pests are expected to occur during future climate change periods because of increased temperatures. The committee found that more intense droughts are mainly observed over north and northwest India.The report says that in 2050, it is estimated that maximum and minimum temperature will go up by 2.40 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees C, respectively. Southern peninsula, northwest India and the southern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Bihar will be the severely affected due to the rise of minimum temperature. Apart from this, large shift in monsoon months, reduction in number of rainy days, increase in rain intensity and high frequency of cyclone would further aggravate the problems of agrarians.The committee was also of the considered view that policy of minimum support price (MSP) is promoting farming practices which are not suitable to local biographical and climatic conditions, thereby, causing problems such as depletion of groundwater resources, degradation of soil, and loss of local biodiversity. The report says that absence of an alternative and economically remunerative cropping strategy is forcing farmers to opt for prevailing water-intensive cropping pattern.It has also come to fore that paddy fields and Rumen fermentation are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in farm sector. ""Studies showed average methane emission of 40-70 kg/ha from rain-fed rice field and 100-180 kg/ha from irrigated rice fields. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emission having high global warming potential ranged 0.6-0.9 kg/ha under lowland irrigated conditions,"" reads the report.The report reads, ""However, the committee is distressed to note that despite efforts being made by the government, private sector dominates in seed production contributing to 50-57% of total seed production of the country. The main focus of private seed companies has been on the high-value and low-volume seeds.""The committee also noted that groundwater level has been decreasing in Punjab. With declining water table, farmers are deepening existing bore wells and shifting from cheaper surface mounted centrifugal pumps to expensive submersible pumps. This is increasing the cost of pumping in the agriculture sector. The report says that the quality of groundwater deteriorates with excess groundwater exploitation due to accelerated diffusion of contaminants from industrial and urban effluents to the groundwater."

Daimary held a review meeting with officials of his department besides those of Food Corporation of India, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd and chambers of commerce. He has ordered the district administrations to take stern action against traders who try to sell essential commodities at exorbitant rates. Vast stretches of the Northeast have remained almost cut off from other parts of the country because of floods. After the meeting, Daimary said: ""In Assam there is adequate stock of all essential commodities. Today I discussed the issue with the stakeholders. They have assured me that there will be no crisis of essential commodities."" ""I have also talked to officials of the Northeast Frontier Railway. They have assured me that train services will be restored within 10 days as the flood situation is improving. Road connectivity is being restored now."" Warning traders who take advantage of floods and try to charge more for essential commodities, the minister said: ""We will take stern action against traders who try to fleece customers. I have already discussed it with all deputy commissioners and directed them to punish such traders as soon as possible. To regulate the market, directions have been issued to the Agriculture Marketing Board to ensure adequate supply of essential commodities."" Daimary also directed the board and the Kamrup Chamber of Commerce to provide 5,000 bags of onions to each market in Guwahati.

Since agriculture makes up roughly 15% of India's GDP, a 4.5 to 9.0% negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to be roughly at 1.5% of GDP per year,"" reads the report.The committee said that various studies indicated overall reduction in productivity by 4-6% in rice, 6% in wheat, 18% in maize, 2.5% in sorghum, 2% in mustard and 2.5% in potato besides significant regional variability. Also, the committee has projected production deficit of 33% for cereals by 2015 and of 43% by 2050. Meanwhile, for pulses, the deficit has been projected at 3% by 2025 and 7% by 2050.Consequently, the committee has suggested that enhancing agricultural productivity is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly poor, small and marginal farmers who would be affected the most.Further, the committee found that the total post-harvest losses to agricultural commodities are estimated to be from 6 to 18% and nearly 30% of the agricultural produce harvested is lost due to inadequate storage facilities in the country, including in Punjab and Haryana.On over exploitation of ground water, the committee found that the Central Ground Water Board ( CGWB ) has submitted plan for artificial recharge in 442 over exploited ground water blocks in Punjab, Harayana, Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,Tamilnadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.The report says that as per the ministry of earth sciences, during the period 1901-2010, heavy rainfall events (rainfall exceeding 15 cm in 24 hours) over northern parts of the country show an increasing trend of about 6% per decade. Also, as per 5th IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, climate projections developed for India for the 2050s indicate an increase in the average temperature by 2-4C during that period, an overall decrease in rainy days by more than 15 days in western and central India and an increase by 5-10 days near foothills of Himalayas and north-east India.The IPCC has also analyzed that there has been a decrease in rainfall in the month of July but there has been an increase in rains in June as well as August across the country indicating a change in the rainfall pattern.The committee observed that animal husbandry and cattle rearing are important source of income for majority of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country.However, it expressed that national plan on dairying has ignored indigenous varieties of cattle leading to over dependence on crossbred varieties for milk production despite the fact that indigenous varieties of cattle possess many traits such as heat tolerance that can be very effective in future scenario projected for climate change.Mainly focusing on climate change effect on agriculture, the committee was of the view that there will be changes in consumption patterns in coming decades due to increasing rate of urbanization and increased income of households. It has been found that demand for fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry and fisheries will increase at faster rate than that of food grains. The need for a climate-resilient approach to agriculture is critical for India where more than 80 percent agriculturists are small farmers and the warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.60C, says the report."

Ushakumari said on Friday that the weekly procurement of potato and cabbage was 90 tonnes and 70 tonnes respectively. Carrot was being procured at 15 tonnes per month. She said the procurement would go up further, as there would be 1,500 Onam markets in the State this year.The aim, she said, was to procure vegetables at 10% higher than the market rate and sell at 30% less than the market price. The Onam markets would have three sections of vegetables  organic, GAP (vegetables produced by the cluster units through Good Agriculture Practice), and those procured from outside the State.K. Jayaprakash, president, Vattavada Cool Season Vegetable Producing Farmers Society, said an average of 50 tonnes of vegetables were being sent daily from Vattavada. Beans was mainly purchased by businessmen from Tamil Nadu. There was a slump in production, though more areas were brought under cultivation, he said. This was because of the long dry spell and delayed sowing. Some farmers lost their crops in cloudbursts. There were also complaints that farmers were not paid promptly after procuring vegetables.Buyers from TNO.K. Mohanraj, a farmer, said he was yet to get his July dues. Mr. Mohanraj said it was true that Horticorp procured vegetables at a price higher than those offered by businessmen.However, we need not wait for long for payment, he said, adding that it was the main reason for selling vegetables to Tamil Nadu businessmen.Earlier, the amount used to be credited to the account of the society in which all the farmers are members. Now the payment is made directly to the farmers account, said Mr. Jayaprakash. He said the Onam procurement would be a success only if the Horticorp and Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, Keralam (VFPCK) promptly paid dues."
314,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,The Hindu,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

Picture by Swapnaneel Bhattacharjee Silchar, Aug. 19: Karimganj deputy commissioner Pradip Kumar Talukdar today said teams would be sent to markets across the district to inspect whether uniformity is being maintained in prices of vegetables. The prices have shot up immensely following the recent waves of floods. A large number of citizens have alleged that some vendorsraders, taking advantage of the floods, are charging arbitrarily. Talukdar, who held a meeting with administration officials this afternoon on the issue, said a report would be submitted on the basis of the inspection and stern action would be taken against those found to have fleeced the public by overcharging them. Currently, the prices of some of the vegetables are - chilly (Rs 300/kg), brinjal (Rs 80/kg), string beans (Rs 80/kg), tomato (Rs 70/kg), ridge gourd (Rs 60/kg), cabbage, radish, eddoe (all Rs 50/kg), onion and sayote (Rs 40/kg) and potato (Rs 20/kg). These rates are prevalent in most markets, including Chantar Bazar, Nilambazar, Shanibari Bazar and Kaliganj. In some places, the prices fluctuate and are even higher, residents alleged. The general secretary of Chantar Bazar Byabsayi Samiti, Pijush Das, said crops have been damaged across the state because of floods this year, pushing up the prices of vegetables, and it would take some time for circumstances to return to normal. He added that vegetables are being sold at rates equal to other markets in Chantar Bazar market and that vendors here do not fleece customers. Narrating the plight of lower middle class and poor people because of unethical practices adopted by a section of vendors, Abdul Bakkar, a retired grade IV government employee, said people are already facing extreme financial troubles because of the floods and the skyrocketing prices of vegetables/commodities added insult to injury. crisis of having vegetables in the district In summer, farmers of Karimganj district grow vegetables like okra, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, pointed gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber and others. In winter, vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, carrot, capsicum and others are grown, he mentioned. Nearly 2,300 hectares of cultivable land, where vegetables are grown, have been damaged and more than 30,000 farmers have suffered losses because of floods this year. Sources said vegetables are being brought to Karimganj from Tripura, Shillong and Barpeta district, among others. However, since floods have affected those places too, the problem has been aggravated."

With Bakrid preceding Thiruvonam by two days, on September 1, the trade fairs too began slightly earlier this year, aimed at tapping into the demand of the twin celebrations. ""At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market',"" said K V Thomas MP, speaking after launching the Onam Trade Fair set up by Supplyco on the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises in Kaloor.Thomas said agencies like Supplyco play a key role in preventing the price hike of essential goods. ""There was a time when wholesale traders use to collect goods from FCI warehouses. But most of them would in turn keep the stock in their own godowns, resulting in increasing number of cases related with the hoarding of goods. They later sell these goods in the black market. This prompted the then government to introduce the Food Safety Bill.This helped government agencies like Supplyco play a major role in providing supplies to the common man,"" said Thomas.

One lakh curry leaf saplings will be distributed on September 11.""THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF ONAMKochi: Every year, the weeks leading up to Onam season are marked by the soaring prices of vegetables. This year, with only about a two week-countdown left for the festival, it is not easy to assess the price trend in the market. Some of the essential vegetables are priced high, but the prices of others, which hit an all time high last month, have come down. For instance, the price of shallots saw a record high price of D140 per kg in July. This month, however, it has come down to D85 per kg. The main reason for the price hike in shallots was the drought in Tamil Nadu from where the produce reaches Kerala. Now, the wholesalers are getting more supply from Andhra Pradesh which is reflected in the reduced price, said N Rajan, a vendor in Kaloor market.However, customers complain vegetables sold cheaply in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka become costly when they cross the border into Kerala. The price increases three or four fold when it reaches here, said Prasanth Jacob, a customer. Raw banana costs only D30 per kg in Coimbatore. However, a customer here has to pay a minimum of D70. Likewise, tomato which is available for D15 per kg in Tamil Nadu gets a weightier price tag here, costing D60 to D70 per kg. The other items that witness a hike in price in August are beetroot, amaranthus, beans, cow pea and drumstick. The price of green chilly and carrot have reduced slightly. ""The prices were fluctuating during the first two weeks of August. However, it is likely to go up by the end of this month, added Rajan.The where and when of fairsSupplyco fairs will be organised in all taluks in Ernakulam. Essential commodities, including red chilly, coriander, black beans, bengal gram, tur dal and vegetables will be available at prices lower than the market price. The trade fairs will function from August 20 to September 3, a day ahead of Thiruvonam. ""There will be special festival offers and gift coupons for consumers,"" said marketing manager R N Satheesh.

Daddimani told presspersons here on Thursday that the Horticulture University and Nourish company representatives will sign a Memorandum of Understanding for setting up the unit on Saturday.This unit requires a minimum of 6 tonnes to a maximum of 20 tonnes on a daily basis. Considering this, the Horticulture Department has begun encouraging farmers to grow sweet potato. This year, the department set a target of engaging 1,000 farmers in cultivation of sweet potato. By the end of 2018, a total of 5,000 farmers are expected to be identified and brought under sweet potato cultivation.Sweet potato can be grown in red soil or even along with regular potatoes. This crop does not require more water. Besides, it is a good source of several vitamins. This root-vegetable has gained in more popularity in the world and the demand too is increasing. There is ample scope to opt for value-addition of sweet potato and the department is all set to provide advanced training to growers, he said.WorkshopThe programme to sign the Memorandum of Understanding will be followed by a one-day workshop-cum-training event for farmers from North Karnataka. The workshop will focus on scientific growing of sweet potato and its processing.Nourish company will enter into an understanding with sweet potato growers for a period of three years and all the produce will be purchased by the company itself. After purchasing, this root-vegetable would be processed at the new unit. This will solve the issue of marketing the crop. The department will hold regular demonstration on how to grow sweet potatoes, harvest them, and on other technical aspects. This project will increase the financial status of farmers, he noted.High demandHorticulture Scientist K. Ramchandra Naik said that sweet potatoes, which come to the market in different colours, are very healthy and will work as a protection shield in preventing diseases. The sweet potatoes grown in India have a huge demand across the world. The horticulture research unit has developed 125 new breeds of sweet potatoes. In the last two or three years, the demand for sweet potato has increased in the U.S. and the U.K. and the food processing companies there are in search of a region wherein sweet potato is being grown. The growing cost comes up to Rs. 10,000 per acre, but it may fetch him up to Rs. 80,000 per acre, he added."

Vegetables sold include those certified as produced using Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).'Onasamridhi' during the last Onam season had witnessed sale of around 4,800 metric tonnes of vegetables over five days, out of which 3,400 metric tonnes were state's own produce.The `Onathinu oru muram pachakkari' scheme which envisages mass cultivation of vegetables with the participation of 63 lakh families, would address the demand only partially. The department's calculation is that it might require 5,207 MT vegeta bles to run these stalls. To fill the gap, Horticorp has been entrusted to procure 940 MT of vegetables from neighbouring states.""For the mass cultivation scheme under which people could raise vegetables in their backyards, on terraces and in grow bags, we had distributed seeds or seedlings of only around five types of vegetables (ladies finger, spinach, snake gourd, brinjal, bitter gourd and chilli). It was meant to create awareness on safe-to-eat vegetables and to boost consumers' confidence,"" said agriculture director A M Sunil Kumar.Envisaged as part of the Haritha Kerala Mission and implemented with the cooperation of Kudumbashree units, homemakers, students, workers under the employment guarantee scheme, vegetable farmers' clusters, officials and various institutions, the scheme had witnessed distribution of 63 lakh packets of seeds, 45 lakh vegetable seedlings, and more than one lakh grow bags.Whether the scheme achieved its aim of cultivating a habit of us ing safe-to-eat vegetables is yet to be seen. However, the increase in the number of vegetable stalls this Onam is huge. The depart ment had run 1,365 outlets last year. This has been made possible by introducing sale of vegetables in cooperation department fairs, Supplyco fairs and Kudum bashree outlets, the director pointed out.Among the 1,500 stalls to be run directly by the department in association with Vegetables and Fruits Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) and Horticorp are 51 eco-shops selling its own brand of organic vegetables 'Kerala Organic', which had hit the market last Vishu . ""All other outlets too will be selling organic or GAP-certified vegetables at a price that is bit higher,"" Sunil Kumar said.Locally grown vegetables will be procured from farmers by Hor ticorp at a 10% higher price, while the farmers will get 20% high price for GAP-cer tified products. At the stalls, the con sumers can buy them availing 30% and 10% discounts respectively. ""Be sides vegetables, the stalls will be selling the fa mous Marayoor jaggery, coconut oil and honey,"" the agriculture director said.The department is hoping to procure 150 tonnes of best qual ity garlic with great medicinal value from Kanthalloor-Vatta vada belt. The area famed for vegetable cultivation will provide a significant volume of cabbage, potato and cauliflower, for which the state has been depending heavily on neighbouring states.Majority of the vegetables to be purchased by Horticorp from other states are the ones not grown in the state.

Thats right, you will either be greeted with a creeped-out stare or a suspicious forced conversation. Not at The Supper Club though. A concept that originated in the US in 1930s, this phenomenon of the culinary culture has birthed unconventional dining premises that also function as a social club. They are usually advertised by word of mouth, and these days, via social media.The benefits for the guests are, more value for money, since not much of the cost goes into maintaining the establishment and an opportunity to socialise while trying out new cuisines. The hosts benefit from the fact that they neednt invest in an establishment to offer their culinary talents to the people. Since there are no rules, they take time to carefully plan every detail to make the customer experience unique.Bringing this phenomenon to the city is the cheerful duo  Arundhati Balachandran and Suneethi Raj, co-founders of Localxo, which curates a series of one-of-a-kind experiences ranging from food and drinks, arts, fitness, master classes and according to Suneethi, possibly anything under the sun. The Supper Club is covered by the food and drink category of Localxo. Our endeavour is to introduce this worldwide phenomenon to the city to showcase passionate chefs to people who want a different dining experience, says Arundhati. Concurs Suneethi, who adds: We try to cover cuisines that are not usually available locally and also open Chennais palette to new flavours.They have conducted two rounds of French cuisine supper clubs and are gearing up for the second round of Peruvian cuisine with The Supper club: Peruvian nights by Namrata Sundaresan, a passionate cook and the owner of Kase cheese. Namrata was discovered by the duo at one of the French cuisine supper clubs.Says Namrata, ""There are some similar elements in Peruvian and Indian cuisines like the use of rice, tubers and gravies. Although the Peruvian cuisine extensively uses chilli peppers, it is a balance that brings out the flavours without scalding your tongue. Peruvian cuisine is very light and earthy, and emphasises on slow cooking.""The menu has options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. You have the Peruvian minestrone soup, which is different from the Italian version due to the use of herbs, along with spinach, quinoa, cassava and artichokes. The appetisers include ceviche with fish for non vegetarians and slow grilled potatoes seasoned with sea salt and served with chilli pepper sauce and olives for vegetarians. The main course will offer a choice between chicken, shrimp or vegetarian.So head out to the Peruvian nights and get a taste of the authentic flavours of Peru.

It is Karnatakas gift to Ooty, said Horticulture Minister S.S. Mallikarjun. The garden would be inaugurated by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in the coming weeks.Christened Siri Horticulture Garden, Fern Hill, Ooty, it was part of the late Maharajas Summer Palace. For decades, it was used as a parent potato garden that supplied seeds to farmers in Kolar, Hassan, Tumakuru and Bengaluru Rural.Over the last 10 years, under the care of botanists from Karnataka, it has been transformed into an oasis of sorts, with flowering plants such as Alstroemeria or Princess Lilies, Begonia, Orchids and Fuchsia. Its landscape includes hillocks, valleys, and six lakes. We have also planned a topiary garden and an Italian garden, said M. Jagadeesh, Joint Director of Horticulture, Lalbagh.Temperate glasshouseThe garden also has a Nilgiri sheep forest and swans aplenty in the lakes and the walking paths. For phase two, the Horticulture Department plans to build a temperate glasshouse, hanging bridges, and chasing fountains.Horticulture expert M.H. Mari Gowda had in the 1940s requested the then Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar to make arrangements for potato germination and cultivation, as sourcing seeds from Shimla and Jalandhar was becoming increasingly difficult.

It was under these tasks that Tabarruk was distributed among the poor irrespective of religion and caste and sent to the descendants of the royal families once a day for the first 10 days of the month of mourning. The Nawab had left an amount of Rs 12 lakh in 1839 at an interest amounting to Rs 48,000 annually to fulfil all tasks under the Deed.Since then until last year, the traditional community kitchen at Chhota Imamabara would be abuzz with activities preparing khameeri roti, potato curry or dal and sheermal. This year, however, the district administration that has additional charge of HAT said that ""complaints about the curry and pulse starting to rot due to weather"" had brought forth suggestion to alter the menu.""Whatever will be convenient and of good quality will be distributed. There were several complaints about the curry and pulse, which is why it was thought of altering it...The sheermal as a better option is under consideration,"" said secretary of HAT and additional district magistrate (ADM) west, Santosh Kumar Vaish.However, this proposal has sought an angry response from common people as well as royal family descendants.""Not a slightest change will be accepted in tradition when the king had left money for customs to be followed. Who is the administration to change it? Why have they created a budget of Rs 27 lakh which is Rs 5 lakh more than last year and are still trying to cut costs by going for just sheermal?"" questioned Farhana Maliki, president of Begumat Royal Family of Awadh.""Every year, there used to be a meeting of HAT with us descendants 15 days before Muharram. This year, we were not involved and decisions were taken by the district magistrate, ADM west and the officer on special duty. What does this show?"" Maliki added.Vaish said, ""We will have a meeting with the families. A second tender has been put up which will be opened on September 13 for a final decision on the menu."""

The rate cut was the first in 10 months and brought policy rates to near 7-year low.The RBI said it will endeavour to keep retail inflation close to 4 per cent but in the near term, there might be some uptick on account of pay commission payouts and price adjustments post GST rollout from July 1."

There are hardly any buyers for our crop. Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in drop of bulk orders from big markets like Delhi and other major cities, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu.He said that potato growers have kept the eatables and seed potatoes in cold storage since the last crop season in anticipation of selling the produce at a better price later.But now there are fewer buyers and poor prices. The crop is still lying and now when the new season crop will hit the market (in next few months) the loss of growers would only aggravate, he added.Facing hardships due to demonetisation, the potato seed growers from Punjab have demanded an immediate freight subsidy so that the growers can transport their crop to other States and fetch some returns.Also, the growers have urged the State government to waive crop loans of potato growers besides asking the State agencies to intervene and generate markets at the national and international level.Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country including West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, UP , MP and Odisha. Potato seed is usually supplied from last week of October to mid-December every year."

(Source: PTI Photo) Arun Jaitley, along with Union Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog Arvind Panagariya and CEO, NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant releasing the book India: Three Year Action Agenda at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. (Source: PTI Photo)Last month, the NITI Aayog released the Three Year Action Agenda (TYAA) for the government, a roadmap for reforming the various sectors of the economy. Here we look at its agenda for the agriculture sector, and how best it can rescue the sector whose growth has plunged to just 1.8 per cent annually in the first three years of the NDA government.In doing so, we also touch upon the recommendations of some important committees constituted by the current government in the realm of agri-food. These are the High Level Committee (HLC) on Management of Foodgrains and Restructuring FCI (headed by Shanta Kumar, January 2015), the Task Force on Agriculture headed by the Vice-Chairman of the NITI Aayog (May 2016) and the four volumes (out of 14) of the Committee on Doubling of Farmers Income (August 2017). The government, thus, has ample reference points for reforming the food and agriculture sector.The TYAA basically talks of action pertaining, first, to increasing productivity of land and water, second to reforming agri-markets on the lines of e-NAM, third, reforming tenancy laws, and finally, relief measures during natural disasters. There is nothing new  and nothing wrong  in these recommendations; they have been made by the committees cited above. The TYAA, however, does not prioritise policy actions, nor does it talk about the role of trade policy in agriculture, or reforming the massive system of food and fertiliser subsidies. Nevertheless, the hard question is whether the government is ready to bite the bullet.We think urgent action is needed on five fronts and list them in order of priority. First, the government needs to improve the profitability of cultivation by getting markets right, second, it needs to invest in water to fulfil its slogan of har khet ko pani and more crop per drop, its third priority should be Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of food and fertiliser subsidies to the accounts of targeted beneficiaries, which can release resources for investments, fourth it should ensure that the new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) delivers compensation to farmers in time, and finally, it should free up land lease markets. Let us elaborate on these points a bit.By now it is clear that the policy of minimum support prices (MSPs)  and the promise of 50 per cent profits over costs in the BJPs election manifesto of 2014  has not improved profitability of cultivation in the last three years. In fact, farmers returns have gone down in the case of most crops. The situation is worse for producers of basic vegetables like potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Prices of these crops during harvest time plunged to about Rs 2 per kg in the last season while the consumers were still paying Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg. Attempts to reform the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets on the lines of the model act of 2003, and now through the Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing Act, 2017, have not achieved much success.However, India has shown in the case of milk, through Operation Flood  a la the AMUL model  that farmers can get 70-80 per cent of the price paid by consumers. Why then cant we have Operation Veggies on similar lines? A beginning can be made with at least onions, potatoes and tomatoes. That would require buying directly from farmers groups (FPOs), setting up logistics from grading, storage to movement, and linking them to organised retail (including e-retail), large processors and exporters. But to do all this, the government will have to commit not only enough resources as it did for Operation Flood but also change certain laws, including the Essential Commodities Act (ECA).The e-NAM scheme, which is supposed to create an all India market, in order to ensure better prices to farmers, has not succeeded in its endeavour so far. Software is still being installed in mandis to enable them to switch auctions from the shouting platform to the electronic ones. Inter-mandi and inter-state transactions are very rare. However, an easier way to improve farmers profitability is to open up exports of all agri-products, without any restrictions, and allowing private trade to build global value chains, keeping the ECA in abeyance. This would require a change from the current pro-consumer approach to one that is focussed on farmers.Second is the issue of investments, especially in water. The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana is mandated to complete 99 irrigation projects by 2019, which will bring 76 lakh ha additional area under irrigation. NABARD, with Rs 40,000 crore as Long-Term Irrigation Fund, is to help states in completing these projects. It would be a commendable achievement for the government if it can complete these projects as planned. But open canal systems with flood irrigation dont give high water-use efficiency.It is time to accord higher priority to micro-irrigation (drip and sprinklers) to achieve the objective of more crop per drop. Israel and the US could be good examples to follow: Israel has the highest proportion (99 per cent) of its irrigated area under micro-irrigation while the US has largest absolute area (15 m ha) under micro-irrigation (See graph).The third area for action should be DBT of food and fertiliser subsidies. The HLC has already provided a roadmap in this respect. Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 crores can be saved each year, which can be invested in water resources and upgrading marketing infrastructure.The fourth area is ensuring that the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) delivers. Currently, several states dont pay premium in time, dont conduct crop cutting experiments, and as a result, farmers suffer long delays in getting any compensation. These lacunae can be fixed through modern technology and better governance, provided there is a champion in the government to deliver.The last suggestion would be to free up land lease markets for long periods. China allows land lease for 30 years so that corporate bodies can work with farmers, bringing in their best expertise, inputs and investments.

He dismissed all speculation regarding inconsistencies in the timeline of the killing and the detention of two accused in the case. Police have information that 10-12 people were involved in the journalist's murder on September 20 at Mandai, the DGP said. However, Shukla added, police have been unable to trace Shantanu's cellphone and requested people to cooperate with the police investigation.Deputy collector of Jirania Tridip Sarkar said the administration has decided to continue with the imposition of Section 144 of CrPC at Mandai till Thursday and it may be extended further, depending on the situation. Saying that the animosity between CPM and the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT)  clashes between which Shantanu was covering after which he was killed  has taken a communal shape, he added.""The administration is trying to diffuse the tension. If people's movement is not restricted during Durga Puja and something went wrong, we would be blamed,"" the deputy collector said.Life in Mandai has not been easy since the incident. Half the markets are shut and the rest are selling items at much higher rates since connectivity with Agartala has not been restored yet. ""Dry fish is not available. It is the most affordable item for us. Green chillies are selling for Rs 400 per kilo, potatoes are being sold at Rs 50 per kilo and onions at Rs 120 per kilo. What does a common man do?"" 56-year-old Magaleswari Noatia, a resident of Mandai, said.Another resident of Mandai, Laxmibati Debbarma, said nothing has been available in the local market apart from bamboo shoots and unripe bananas over the last week. Several businessmen in Jirania, who cater to the markets of Mandai, said police and the administration are responsible for the disruption.The handling of the situation, they said, has made matters worse.""Business has actually been disturbed since July, when IPFT staged a road and rail blockade. Movement did resume after a while, but after the murder, everything is back where it was, he added."

When it is de rigeur for engineering graduates to take the software route through campus interviews and land assignments abroad, Naveen Hegde, an engineering graduate from Sirsi, did an about-turn. Naveen decided to return to his village in Sirsi and set up a business that would offer direct and indirect employment to villagers, even if it was in a small way. And thats how his start-up iTOrFood was formed.Naveen HegdeIf returning to his village to do business was risky enough, starting a beverages company where he had practically no hands-on experience was even riskier. But Naveen had set out to do this even before he graduated. He did his own ground work on selling beverages, more specifically natural juices. He assessed the pulse of the market and trends.He also did a survey of the products available near Sirsi. And in 2015 at the age of 23, Naveen turned entrepreneur with iTOrFood, iTOr being an abbreviation for Idea to Reality. It pretty much sums up his own journey.Naveen says, I was not interested to leave my parents alone in the village and go to metros in search of a job. I kept thinking of starting an initiative in my village. I explained my idea to them and they were very supportive.With the backing of his parents, he invested nearly `15 lakh along with a partner and began to produce kokum, lemon, amla and tamarind juices without adding flavours, colours and preservatives at his village Hulgol, about 15 km from Sirsi on Yellapur road.Concentrating on the markets of Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mangaluru, Naveen has been producing these juices under the brand name Hooglu. It was just meant to be a catchy word, derived from his village name Hulgol and making it sound similar to Google, that is Hulgol + Google = Hooglu.Life hasnt been without challenges. It was tough to initially carve a niche for his products in metro markets. But he managed to market it as a natural fruit juice and healthy drink by cashing in on the growing health consciousness among people.Hooglu products at a small outletWe got help from the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research in Bengaluru. They gave us a lot of technical support. We also got some discounts on machineries under the scheme of National Horticulture Mission and started our unit in a plot in my village. We constructed a 2000 sq ft building for manufacturing. We collect raw material from Sirsi and surrounding areas only to make the beverages, says Naveen.Today, Naveens company has given direct employment to 10 people while another 15 people are indirectly employed in sales through his start-up. The daily production is 2,000 units of juice packs.Recently the company also ventured into making 12 varieties of banana and potato chips. Naveen is focused on building the brand in the three big cities first. He says after that, he plans to expand his business in smaller cities, including Mysuru, Hubballi, Belagavi and others. He feels there is a huge market for natural organic products that are free from artificial flavours and colours. I want to gradually expand my business and become an example for other youngsters who want to go back to villages and tap their entrepreneurial spirit, says Naveen.It is a great initiative of a young boy from Sirsi region. Such entrepreneurs, who start their set-up in industrially backward regions, should be recognised by Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and the ministry should promote their products Ramesh Patil, President of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, HubballiIn agriculture if processing happens at source, farmer can get highest price for his products. Naveens venture utilizes local resources like banana, kokum etc.Farmers who supply products to his venture are happy with the price they are gettingK M Hegde, farmer, Hulgol village"

This type of potato is cultivated over 12,500 hectares in these districts, which produce around 1 lakh metric tonnes of tuber each Kharif. Heavy rainfall in September destroyed potatoes that were ready to be harvested but were still underground. It led to rotting of these tubers, rendering them unusable,"" said Sahane.Of the three types of potato varieties that hit the retail markets, one of them will be used by processed food manufacturers due to a dearth in potatoes used for processed foods like chips. ""This may result in rise in potato prices around Diwali in the retail market,"" said Sahane.Ashok Bajare, who heads a farmers' group in Satgaon Pathar, Ambegaon taluka, about 60 km from Pune, one of the regions that grows these potatoes, said, ""Processed food potato plantations dipped by 25% this year as farmers did not sow root vegetables like last few years. Of the 75% plantations carried out this Kharif, close to 30% of the produce, which was ready for harvest, rotted due to heavy rains in September. This means that of the 35,000 metric tonnes of potatoes ready for harvest, over 10,000 metric tonnes perished in heavy rains.""Mangesh Pawale, a potato grower in Satgaon Pathar, said that of the 100 tonne potatoes he was expecting to harvest this Kharif, heavy rains destroyed 50%-60% of the produce, leaving only 40 to 50 tonnes that could be sold.Meanwhile, Shriram Gadhave, president, VGAI, told TOI that spells of heavy rain in September resulted in a dip in yield of other vegetables as well, with farmers suffering 40% to 50% yield losses. ""Though farmers are suffering losses, markets have a regular supply because the area under vegetables has doubled in comparison to last year,"" said Gadhave."
337,Scores tied on Day 1,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171010/jsp/calcutta/story_177258.jsp,2017-10-10,Telegraph,"A moment from the England-Chile match at Salt Lake stadium on Sunday. Picture by Pabitra DasOct. 9: Thanks to a difference of interpretation with the police about what the size of a ladies' handbag is, I was sent back from the gate of Salt Lake stadium on Sunday afternoon. According to the officers, ""purse"" means a bag for just the cash. My bag had my raincoat stashed in it. So it did not qualify for passage, so what if there were forecasts of a light shower. My friend had come armed with umbrellas and was promptly issued a retreat order. We did find a man who had started storing helmets, bags and suchlike in a heap for a price on the pavement near Gate 1, but he did not inspire confidence. So we trudged back to the parked car to deposit it all. This meant we were about 10 minutes late for the match. Truth be told, the entry was seamless and the seats (we were behind the goal at the north end) had more legspace than at the refurbished Eden Gardens. But even as England unleashed one attack after another at our end, we were frustrated at not seeing a single conversion. At half-time, my friend's son moped: ""So unfair! Couldn't they score at least one in the first half so we could see it up close?"" A fellow spectator seated in front turned and quipped: "" Ekta goal toh hoyechhey ekdom shurutey (They scored one at the start)."" Really? So Chile was trailing? How would we know? There was nothing where we were sitting to indicate what the status of the match was. When the second goal was scored (at the other end since the teams had swapped sides), we noticed youths rushing to the lowest steps on the aisle and looking up to the upper tier. I followed them and spotted a giant screen upstairs showing the live feed of the match. There was no other semblance of a scoreboard elsewhere. As an Eden regular, I could not help but contrast the experience. Eden has three scoreboards since 2011. One is the giant electronic score board at the High Court end which shows both the score and the live feed. Another is the old manual one over C Block, right of the clubhouse. There is a third scoreboard over J Block, left of the clubhouse, which was turned from manual to an electronic one with a smaller screen last year. So anyone seated at any corner of the stadium or walking in at anytime can easily grasp the match situation. It also helps that the Calcutta police allows binoculars. Even if a second giant screen cannot be installed at Salt Lake stadium, multiple digital score lines on the edge of the upper tier should be. A little more variety of food would also be welcome. All one gets are popcorn, potato chips, fruit cake slices and pizza (the stalls closest to us soon ran out of pizza) which is inadequate especially where there is a double header, like again on October 11 and 14. The gates open at 3pm and the second match ends close to 10pm. So spectators would need more than titbits. Realising this later in the evening, the food stall employees started to mix muri with sauce, sprinkled with peanuts and packed it off for a neat Rs 50 per container. It was so hot that I had to rush to buy a water bottle. Each ticket holder was entitled to a free water pouch which was long exhausted. Finally, a word on the washroom. While it was impressive to find sanitary fittings of a top-notch brand in the ladies' toilet, it would help if someone checks if the latches of all the doors can be fastened!"

The farmers, who had once started cultivating sweet potatoes with the assistance of Agriculture department in 2014, have now become self-reliant and are now growing the crop on their own.Farmers of Sadar block have grown sweet potatoes over at least 100 hectares on commercial basis. Most of the beneficiaries of this cultivation are women, who had been trained in farming. They can do everything, from preparing the ground to harvesting the crop.They usually start the cultivation from July onwards. They harvest the potatoes in October. Under the Nutri Farm initiative of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), agriculture scientists had demonstrated on growing sweet potatoes in 2014-2015 and encouraged the farmers to cultivate the crop in place of paddy.The farmers followed their suggestions and now they have benefited from the crop, which requires low investment for its cultivation. The cash crop does not need much water, experts said.After we got success in the farming, scientists trained us for value addition so that we make more profit, said Amrendra Behera, a farmer.These farmers are trained enough. They do the farming without any support from the agriculturalist. Government needs to guide them for marketing their produce and help them enhance the productivity and cultivation area with changing times. This is better than paddy cultivation. In the absence of Governments marketing initiatives, some middlemen collect sweet potatoes from the fields and sell them to make more profits from the local markets. This is sheer exploitation of the real growers, District Agriculture Officer, Gunanidhi Behera, said.Recently, experts from France had visited the crop field and interacted with farmers over the farming process and risk management involved, sources said.Meanwhile, farmers in the area urge the State to turn its attention towards the cultivation of sweet potatoes. Krishi Vigyan Kendra and Agriculture department must create market links to give us better price for the cash crop, they said."

When contacted, Rythu Bazar officials said the market procures vegetables from the neighbouring villages of Krishna and Guntur district on a daily basis and all those areas have seen bumper productions.They claimed that vegetable farmers would not suffer much loss as vegetable crops are harvested in phases. After a fortnight, the prices would stabilise bringing relief to the growers, they said."
347,Making the switch to drought-resistant minor millets,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/making-the-switch-to-drought-resistant-minor-millets/article19942909.ece,2017-10-29,The Hindu,"Fed up with drought for the past three years, over 500 farmers of Gandasi hobli in Arsikere taluk have taken up cultivation of minor millets, thanks to the support extended by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.Under the banks sustainable development initiative, farmers have been provided financial assistance and technical guidance to cultivate the drought-resistant crop.Jayanna, a farmer in Bachenahalli, told The Hindu: My coconut farm has stopped giving yield owing to drought. Borewells too have dried up. Three months ago, he sowed seeds of korale (browntop millets). I have invested hardly Rs. 2,000 to grow korale. The yield is expected to be around 4 quintals worth about Rs. 12,000, he said.As it was the first time he chose to cultivate millets, he limited it to only one acre. The millet is rich in fibre and many growers keep a major portion of it for personal consumption. When this correspondent visited Mr. Jayannas farm on Friday, Korale Raghu of Sira taluk, who is known for cultivation of korale millet in Tumakuru district, was interacting with local farmers on the importance of millets. Korale cultivation is cost effective. With minimum investment, farmers can register maximum returns, he said. He grows korale millet on 17 acres of land.Earlier, G.V. Raghu, project director of Organisation for Resource Development and Environment Rejuvenation, said: Farmers in the hobli were cultivating potato and maize. Owing to long-time mono-crop cultivation, the yield had come down. Now, hundreds of farmers have grown ragi and they are happy with the yield. His NGO has been engaged in educating farmers on the importance of millet cultivation. Similarly, many have grown foxtail millet, little millet and green gram.V.G. Bhat, District Development Manager (NABARD). said: With the view of holistic development, the bank is encouraging cultivation of minor millets in parts of drought-prone taluks. The bank is happy with the response from the farmers. The bank has spent over Rs. 9 lakh for starting farmer-producer organisations, besides expenses on training, providing seeds and fertilizers."

(Express Photo by Ratan Lal) Children eating mid-day meal at the school Santoshi was enrolled in. They were served rice, pulses, and a soyabean-potato curry; policemen provided for Santoshis familys security following threats from villagers. (Express Photo by Ratan Lal)Her hair brushed back, a comb tucked in her bun, Gudiya (26) is at ease this Tuesday afternoon. People from the administration are hovering around her, while six policemen keep a vigil on visitors. Officials from Jaldega block in Jharkhands Simdega district, a Naxal-dominated area, have come to the house in Karimati village to help the family encash a cheque of Rs 50,000 given by the administration to Gudiyas mother, Koyli Devi (45). They escort her to the bank located at Jaldega, where Koyli is told she can withdraw the money next week.Breastfeeding the youngest of her children, a two-and-a-half-year-old boy, half-an-hour later, Koyli talks of all she can buy with the money. Or could have bought for Santoshi. On September 28 night, her 11-year-old daughter died  Koyli says of starvation  seven months after the family stopped getting their rations as their Aadhaar wasnt linked to PDS. Later, the familys name was struck off the ration card list. Santoshi was the third child Koyli lost; the other two died of illness.Read | Santoshi died of starvationApart from the Rs 50,000 cheque and the Rs 15,000-odd in aid given by visiting leaders, Santoshis death has brought the family 75 kg of rice from the government and other benefactors, 20 kg of potatoes, two litres of edible oil, adequate kerosene oil, 10 soap bars, some green vegetables and tomatoes. Koyli is planning to stock up on more vegetables and pulses at the Wednesday haat.Then, once the cheque is encashed, Koyli will make other purchases. Family members are saying I should get a mobile phone. Also, we need things for the house. We will buy a box (suitcase), she says. The family, including Koyli, husband Tatya Naik, daughters Gudiya and Chando Kumari, and son Prakash, lives in a mud house, with mud-baked tiles for roof. The house comprises a large room, with a small area partitioned off as kitchen.The rest of the money she would keep in the bank, Koyli says, as saving  a new luxury for her.Earlier that day, Koyli indulged in another small luxury. When Chando, 8, asked for something to eat, she gave her Rs 10 to buy coconut biscuits. She likes fancy things to eat and was crying, Koyli says, with a faint smile.Santoshi was never fussy about food, the 45-year-old adds. She only kept asking for rice, but there was not a single grain at home.***************Rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, rice for dinner. Thats been Hemanti Kumaris routine all 10 years of her life. She is in Class 5 of Upgraded Primary School, Karimati. Santoshi cleared Class 5 from here too early this year, but never went on to the middle school (Classes 6 to 8), in the nearby Pangur hamlet.A sprightly girl, barely over 3 ft in height in her slippers and school uniform, Hemanti is happy as today has been a special day. In the morning, she made herself two chappatis and boiled some potatoes  that will be her evening snack, a rare fourth meal.Read | After starvation death case: Jharkhand minister scraps top state officials order on Aadhaar-PDS linkHer mother Padma Devi sits next to an earthen chulha, dug in the verandah of their mud house. She has placed twigs as cooking fuel, and from time to time, stirs a potato curry with tomatoes on the chulha.Hemantis father Gurucharan Mahato works as a labourer, taking up odd jobs. Padma cant do much work as both her legs are amputated. They live at her brother Nareshs home, and are grateful they have only two children to raise. Most families here have five to six children.Describing a regular day, Hemanti says she and her friends eat rice gruel in the morning, have rice with pulses and a seasonal vegetable for mid-day meal at school, and rice gruel again for dinner, sometimes supplemented with guda (a local shrub eaten raw). Only the mid-day meal sees variation, mostly in the form of papad and pickles on Saturdays, fruits three days a week, and eggs once a week.Shiv Nath Singh, a student of Class 3 in Hemantis school, has not gone to school. Mother Rukmani Devi remains silent when asked why. Putting plain rice before him for lunch, the 40-year-old says potatoes cost Rs 10 a kg. We cant get potatoes daily. We have pulses, but we only cook them sometimes.Ask what they consider a good meal, and she breaks into a laugh. Yahi sab na bhaat, daal, sabzi (Its all this only rice, pulses, vegetables). Once in a while, for a feast or a family function, villagers buy chicken or mutton.PDS doesnt provide more than 150-250 gm of rice per person per day on a ration card (see box). With their large sizes, families struggle to feed mouths. In the open market, rice of similar or lower grade costs at least Rs 22 a kg, while 2.5 litres of kerosene that they are also entitled to under PDS comes for Rs 75. Families cant afford these rates, and even buy their ration in bits and pieces as they never have enough money to buy in bulk.As per the October 2017 figures on the Jharkhand governments portal, 2,212 people in Karimati are under the PDS. Villagers claim almost every household has one members Aadhaar linked to their ration card.After Santoshis death, officials suspended the licence of the PDS dealer and Block Supply Officer for failing to ensure uninterrupted ration supply to her family, despite non-matching of Aadhaar. On October 21, Jharkhand Minister for Public Distribution System and Consumer Affairs Saryu Roy annulled an order by Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma to delete ration cards not linked with Aadhaar.***************I know families in Karimati who just scrape through, says Sudama Kachhap, a para-teacher heading the Upgraded Primary School. Santoshi used to be his student.Kachhap says Santoshis mother had promised to send her to middle school. But she didnt They are just so poor, he says.Even in this village of mainly daily wage labourers and farmers with small fields and poor yields, Kachhap adds, there was no family in as pitiable a state as Santoshis. Agar is gaon mein koi antim vyakti ya antim parivar hai, to yahi hai. Inse buri sthiti kisi ki nahin hai (If there is that last man or last family in this village, they are the one. Nobody is in as poor a condition as them), the 40-year-old says.(Express Photograph by Ratan Lal) (Express Photograph by Ratan Lal)As part of his duties, Kachchap also supervises the mid-day meal at the school.For the allocated Rs 4.13 per child per day, a mid-day meal is supposed to provide 450 gm of calories and 12 gm of proteins to children at the primary level. Children in middle school (Classes 6-8), are entitled to Rs 6.18 per day, for 700 calories and 20 gm proteins. Additionally, at Rs 4 per child per day, egg or seasonal fruit is given to the students on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.If the school remains closed for, say, four days, more than 90 per cent children would have eaten only rice those days, says Kachhap.The rations for the mid-day meal are sourced from the PDS block godown. The cost of the cook, appointed locally, comes out of the money allocated for children. Kachhap says the money is too less, going by the prices of eggs and vegetables that they have to buy from the open market, but they manage.There is another reason Kachchap is closely linked to Santoshis case. Till September last year, this para-teacher was also the Booth Level Officer (BLO) of Karimati, responsible for ensuring that villagers got themselves enrolled in Aadhaar, and got ration cards made. But, following an order that para-teachers should not be engaged in non-teaching works, his name was struck off.Read | Jharkhand starvation case: Girls family heckled out of village, now back homeHowever, since Kachchap knew the people, he continued to do the work. We have got complaints against him and are inquiring, says Jaldega Block Development Officer (BDO) Sanjay Kongari, referring to charges that Kachchap took money to get ration cards made. Kachchap denies the allegations.Hirawati Kumari, 17, claims he demanded Rs 1,600 from the family for a ration card. Her father Chhotu Ram died 18 months ago and her mother Keriyo Devi sustains the family working as a help in houses or through odd jobs in fields, earning around Rs 50 per day.Without a ration card, the family depends on the PDS Chhotu Rams elder brother gets. Giving a break-up of what it costs to buy from the market, Hirawati talks about last Wednesday when the family got 10 kg rice from the haat for Rs 22 per kg. Mother took an advance from a person she works for. She will now work four-five days without any reimbursement to pay back. She spent an additional Rs 30 to buy 3 kg of potatoes.Its a week later, and the family of four is left with only some rice, potatoes and guda. Hirawati says they have run out of sugar, tea and kerosene.She is lucky though, the 17-year-old amends. Thanks to her enrolment at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, 7 km away, where she studies in Class 8, she gets regular food. These schools were set up to ensure quality education for girls, predominantly from SC/ST, OBC and minority communities, in difficult areas, and admit children after a test. Hirawatis younger siblings, aged 10 and 4, depend on help from relatives.***************At Karimatis anganwadi centre, K D Chaudhary, the in-charge of the Jaldega Community Health Centre (CHC), is holding a health check-up camp. That is another thing Santoshis death has brought to Karimati. Chaudhary admits he does not remember the last time such a camp was held in the village, though a mobile medical van does the rounds every three-four months.Accompanying him is Dr Binod Oraon, the single man responsible for 174 primary schools and 132 anganwadi centres in Jaldega under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram. It is an initiative under the National Health Mission for early intervention for children from birth to 18 years to cover 4 Ds  Defects at birth, Deficiencies, Diseases, and Development delays.Ask when he last visited Karimati, and Dr Oraon tells you to do the math. There are 365 days in a year. You add 174 and 132. Plus, there are several other issues to be looked into. How many times can I come in a year?Chaudhary is despondent about what he has seen so far at the health camp. Alcoholism is rampant. Their livers are weak, eyes are damaged, many have lost their senses. Jaundice, Hepatitis, TB There is severe lack of awareness, he reels off.As for malaria, the official cause of Santoshis death, Chaudhary says it is common, though not endemic. In fact, no malaria deaths have been reported from here in the last few years.***************Its easy to slip out of the net, like Santoshi and her family did. BDO Kongari claims it was technicalities that led to their name being taken off PDS list.Koylis husband Tatya, who also went by the name Tetwa, had a ration card. A few years ago, the government policy was changed when it was felt that ration cards should be in the name of women heads of the family, as they were more sincere. Ideally, in Koylis case, Tatyas name should have been replaced by Koylis. But, somehow, it got transferred to the name of Balmati Devi, Tatyas mother. The problem is that Balmati died 10 years ago, he says.In 2016, the Point-of-Sale (PoS) machine system was introduced, for biometric identification through Aadhaar of ration card holders. It required the Aadhaar number of at least one member of the family to be linked to their ration card. Both Koyli and Gudiya had Aadhaar since 2013. But nobody from the family got their Aadhaar linked to the ration card, as a result of which Balmatis name finally got deleted, says Kongari.Right to Food Campaign activist Tara Mani Sahu, who had raised the issue of Koylis ration card when Santoshi was alive, says, I tried to raise the matter at the district level, but nothing happened. We also get constant complaints about beneficiaries getting less than entitled ration. Dealers cut 1-2 kg, giving one or the other reason.There are also cases of members of families left out of ration cards. In the case of Lal Card holders (see box), the amount of ration a family gets will be less, points out Sahu.Kongari, however, maintains that the process of Aadhaar seeding with schemes has been smooth, and that nearly 100 per cent of the work is done in his block. New people will be added, but for all the programmes using direct benefit transfer (DBT, cash being transferred into accounts), Aadhaar seeding is almost complete, he says.But some villagers complain about MNREGA payments being irregular. Dupatti Devi worked under MNREGA a year ago and should have got over Rs 3,500. But she has got just Rs 800, she claims. Her husband Bideshi Baraik, she says, is a pagla  a euphemism for a chronic alcoholic in these parts. With four children to support, Dupatti is desperate. Only I know how I run my house, she says.District Supply Officer Nanki Ram admits there are problems. But we are trying to put in place a system where beneficiaries get payment without middlemen. Some names may have got left out. We are launching campaigns to get them enlisted, he says.PDS minister Saryu Roy says, What I mentioned in the order (annulling the order of the Chief Secretary), the same thing has now been said in a circular of the Government of India. It is very clear-cut (that non-linking of Aadhaar should not be used to deny benefits).Further, Roy says, he has asked the department to provide him month-wise and reason-wise break-up of the 11.3 lakh ration cards deleted after the PoS system was introduced. In the same period, the department has added nine lakh beneficiaries. I want to be sure that any deserving candidate has not got his name struck off, he says.***************Among the villagers, Santoshi or Koyli find no sympathy, with the people backing officials assertion that she died of malaria. Aaj ka jug mein koi bhookh se mare hao (Does anybody die of hunger in this day and age)? questions a woman.With Tatya unable to work, Koyli and Gudiya support the family through odd jobs at Lachragarh, or collect wood from the jungle and sell it at Rs 30-Rs 40 per bundle. The day-long task of picking up the twigs, bundling and selling them fetches only a little more. Labourer jobs, for around Rs 200 a day, are few and far between.None of the villagers was around to witness Santoshis slow descent to death, Gudiya recalls. Koyli had not been going to work. There was no rice for 15 days and, in the last eight days, the family went without a meal. Let alone rice, there was no salt, sugar, kerosene, not even a match-stick.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

His officials asserted the constraints could be easily ironed out given that the same alliance was in power at the Centre and in the state.""The only thing needed is political will for greater public good,"" a senior AAI official said on condition of anonymity. ""If initiatives are taken, the common people will also understand the situation and the solutions.""Patna airport is suffering from an acute space crunch that is hindering its expansion. The present length of the runway in Patna is just 7,000ft; a minimum 9,500 feet is necessary for safe landing by bigger aircraft. Also, of the existing runway, only 6,409 feet is available during landing and take-off because of location constraints, including structures like the state secretariat's clock tower, the Delhi-Howrah railway line on the southern side and a busy Peer Ali Path (Airport Road) to the north.Because of the short length only seasoned pilots who have previously landed and taken off from Patna are allowed here, to reduce chances of any mishap. An Alliance Air jet that crashed in Patna in July 2000 killed over 50 people.""Land is available close to the airport,"" an AAI official said. ""Hundreds of acres of land is locked in huge campuses belonging to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Research Complex for Eastern Region and Central Potato Research and Central Potato Research Institute. Why can't these be shifted? Patna needs a good airport.""Another AAI official said that with the metro rail slated to come to Patna and good quality tunnelling machines available, the railway line on the southern side could be taken underground, freeing the land for airport expansion.""And why not relocate the secretariat clock tower, which lies in the aircraft approach funnel? It is just a vestige of the British era, when very few people had wristwatches. With latest techniques, it could be easily removed elsewhere or its height lessened,"" an AAI official said.The officials added that the Peer Ali Path could be closed and given to the airport so that it could expand a bit in that direction too, solving all the issues related to parking and terminal building.""If we get the identified land, we'll be able to increase the runway length to 12,000 feet. The cost of relocating other government institutions will still be much less than building a new airport for Patna,"" an official said.Meanwhile, the central and the state government are looking towards the Bihta air force base and issues related to construction of a terminal building for public use are being sorted out."
350,Value destruction: UP farmers gift potatoes to cold stores,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/value-destruction-uttar-pradesh-farmers-gift-potatoes-to-cold-stores-4918275/,2017-11-02,Indian Express,"Farm labourers planting potatoes at a field near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. (Express Photo: Harish Damodaran) Farm labourers planting potatoes at a field near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. (Express Photo: Harish Damodaran)Pradeep Chaudhary alias Guddu has seen the potato trade going through periods of mandi (slack). But never has this 47-year-old witnessed bekadri (value destruction)  the term he uses to describe the situation in the last one year, since the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise all Rs 500 and 1,000 denomination currency notes.For about a month before notebandi happened on November 8, potato was selling at Rs 500-700 per bag of 50 kg (or Rs 10-14/kg). By the month-end, prices had crashed to Rs 300-350 and further to Rs 175-225 during February-March, when the new crop was being harvested. And strangely, they havent recovered from those levels, even as the season is over and planting of the next crop is almost complete, says Guddu, owner of Om Sheet Grah Pvt Ltd, a cold storage unit at Sadabad town in Uttar Pradeshs Hathras districtFarmers in these parts  the stretch from Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura, Agra, Firozabad, Etawah, Mainpuri, Kannauj and Farrukhabad in southwest UP accounts for roughly a fifth of Indias total potato production  plant the tuber during mid-October and early November. Only 15-20 per cent of this crop is sold at the time of its harvesting towards February-March. Farmers keep the remaining 80-85 per cent in cold stores  where the potatoes are maintained at 4-5 degrees Celsius  and make staggered sales through the summer and monsoon months.This time round, probably 99 per cent of the potatoes were put into cold storage, given the low prices and lack of buyers during harvest time. Farmers thought they would realise better rates later in the season, notes Guddu. But it hasnt worked that way. Currently, the normal large (mota) potatoes are being sold from cold stores at Rs 200-225 per bag (Rs 4-4.5/kg). The medium gulla tubers are fetching just Rs 90-100 a bag (Rs 1.80-2/kg), while being even lower, at Rs 50-60 a bag (Rs 1/kg), for small kirri potatoes.But the farmer isnt the only loser. Guddus cold store can stock up to three lakh bags of potatoes. 90 per cent of this would normally have been disposed of by end-October, with the air-conditioning, too, shut with the winter arriving in the second half of November. This would allow for maintenance over the next two months and enable storing of the new crop from February.The current year, though, has been different. On October 31  when the season technically ends and cold stores cannot run without obtaining renewal licences from the state horticulture department  Guddus unit was saddled with unsold stocks of 80,000-odd bags. Most cold stores have anywhere between 25 to 35 per cent of last seasons potatoes that farmers have kept and are not re-claiming, adds Guddu.Old potatoes being dumped outside a cold store unit at Sadabad in Uttar Pradesh. (Express photo: Harish Damodaran) Old potatoes being dumped outside a cold store unit at Sadabad in Uttar Pradesh. (Express photo: Harish Damodaran)The reason for farmers not taking back their stored potatoes is simple. Cold stores charge around Rs 110 for every bag, whether it is kept for one month or eight months. Besides, they finance farmers to cover their cost of harvesting, grading and bagging (Rs 45-50), loading (Rs 3) and transport from the field to the store (Rs 20). In many cases, the credit  usually at 1.5 per cent interest per month  extends even to the bardana or jute bags costing Rs 22-23 each.If the borrowed money with interest is also included, we have to pay Rs 200 or more on every bag to the store owner. If the price we are getting does not cover even that, why take back the bag at all? asks Puran Singh. This 60-bigha (12-acre) farmer from Tambka village in Mathura districts Mahavan tehsil still has 700 out of his 2,000 bags harvested during March lying at Susheela Cold Storage in Agra. Even on the remaining 1,300 bags, the money realised from sales, at Rs 125 to Rs 225/bag, has gone entirely to pay the store owner, leaving him with nothing.The cold stores will eventually recover their Rs 110 charge and also much of what they have lent to farmers with interest. For the farmer, a price of Rs 200 per bag (Rs 4/kg) may pay his liabilities to the cold store, but will not even cover cultivation costs, contends Chaudhary Pushpendra Singh, president of Kisan Shakti Sangh, a farmer advocacy organisation.He reckons the total cost of cultivating potatoes at over Rs 10,000 a bigha, which, at an average 40 bags/bigha yield, translates into Rs 5 per kg. If to this, another Rs 4 is added towards harvesting, bagging, transport and cold storage costs, the farmer will just about start making money at a price of Rs 9/kg. The breakeven goes up further by Rs 2/kg if land is leased at the existing rates of Rs 4,000 per bigha. For potato cultivation to be profitable, the farmer has to get about Rs 15/kg. Right now, he cannot afford to even buy new seed potatoes. Most farmers this season have used their last years stored crop as seed, points out Singh.But why are prices continuing to rule low even now, when cash has supposedly returned with the Reserve Bank of India printing new notes? This is a business that always operated on cash. While the notes may be back, you are still not allowed to make daily withdrawals or deposits of more than Rs two lakh. These restrictions, plus the fear of being tracked by the income tax department, have made traders wary of buying and stocking up produce, explains Guddu.The effects of it are being felt in places such as Hathras. This district alone has about 150 operational cold stores, handling an average of two lakh bags each. At last years average realisation of Rs 400 per bag (Rs 8/kg) for all varieties  including gulla and kirri  the value of this entire produce would have been Rs 1,200 crore. But at Rs 150 per bag (Rs 3/kg), the same 3 crore bags from a single district would be worth Rs 450 crore.If this calculation is extended to other potato-belt districts, you can imagine how much value destruction has taken place in the last one year. And the loser is not just the farmer, but also those who sell and provide services to him, observes Pushpendra Singh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

353,When pineapples tell the cost of Brexit,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/641262/when-pineapples-tell-cost-brexit.html,2017-11-06,Deccan Herald,"Peter S Goodman, International New York Times Nov 6 2017, 0:57 ISTworker at Nim's Fruit Crisps, founded by Nimisha Raja (inset), prepares pear slices. Britain has been increasingly grappling with its pending departure from the EU, and for Nim's, the impact of Brexit is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple. NYTBritain is increasingly grappling with the bewildering economic consequences of its pending departure from the European Union. For one company, Nim's Fruit Crisps, in Sittingbourne, England, the effect is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple.Nim's dries fruits into snacks served up like potato chips, operating out of a former metal shop in this industrial enclave east of London. One of its best-selling varieties uses pineapple from Costa Rica that is shipped in by an Amsterdam-based trading company.The pineapple is priced in euros. Since Britain's decision to leave the European Union - widely known as Brexit - the British pound has surrendered nearly 14 percent of its value against the euro on fears that trade will be disrupted.Confronting higher prices for pineapple, the company's founder, Nimisha Raja, recently brought in a machine to replace three workers who used to peel fruit by hand. ""I had to cut costs somewhere,"" she said.She could be speaking for all of Britain.In the 16 months since the referendum that set Brexit in motion, the British economy has weakened in the face of a confounding array of uncertainties. Thrift is the order of the day, along with worries about multinational companies' paring their investments in Britain.Last week, the picture appeared to brighten, as official data showed the economy had expanded a tad more than expected between July and September. The growth of 0.4 percent for the quarter, which bested expectations of 0.3 percent, reinforced the market's assumptions that the Bank of England will lift rates when it convenes on Thursday, using a presumably stronger economy as the impetus.But some economists fear such a move is premature given Britain's fragile state. Many focused on plunging retail and car sales as a harbinger of trouble.The drop in the pound has lifted prices on goods ranging from Italian olive oil to Chinese-made electronics. The rate of inflation reached 3 percent in September, the fastest pace in five years. Consumer spending has dipped during the past year while consumer credit is rising - a combination that often ends badly.The Brexit referendum prompted negotiations through which Britain and a jilted Europe are supposed to hash out their future dealings. But the talks have proved acrimonious and largely futile. This has heightened concerns that a two-year deadline on negotiations could pass without a deal, subjecting companies that trade across the English Channel with unsettling ambiguities about future rules. The Bank of England has been warning banks to prepare for that very eventuality as one possible outcome.With the boundaries of commerce unclear, some companies are reassessing the appeal of centering operations in Britain, the former seat of a global empire that increasingly looks like an island nation.""Clearly, growth has slowed quite sharply over the last several months,"" said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. ""There is a sense that companies have been postponing investment.""Britain now stands as one of the world's weakest major economies, even as Europe, Asia and North America enjoy relatively robust growth. During the first nine months of the year, the British economy expanded at an annualized rate of only 1.3 percent.Absent a deal, global banks are confronting the prospect that they could no longer use their London office to serve customers across the Continent. Many have been scouting spaces in financial centers that are firmly within EU territory.Citigroup has outlined plans to set up a trading operation in Frankfurt, while applying for a backup license in France. Goldman Sachs recently leased expanded office space in Frankfurt.In the West Midlands, an industrial reach of England that includes Birmingham, foreign direct investment dipped slightly in the year after the Brexit vote, according to a recent assessment from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce.The chamber pinned the blame on ""uncertainty caused by the outcome of the EU referendum,"" which was ""delaying investment decisions, a trend echoed in other areas of the U.K.""Chamber representatives have been turning their attention beyond the EU in pursuit of fresh investment. A delegation recently returned from Turkey. In planning future visits, the chamber is especially focused on cultivating business with members of the British Commonwealth.""It's a rewinding of history, overtly looking for trade with Commonwealth countries, rather than with Europe,"" said John Lamb, a chamber spokesman. ""We really are starting to look at markets in the post-Brexit world.""Time itself has become a threat. As negotiations yield headlines about sniping within Britain's governing Conservative party, each week that passes absent clarity amplifies pressure on companies to shift people and operations to Europe.""We can't see how investment particularly, but also consumption, will not be affected,"" said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. ""How can you go ahead with big investments when you don't know what framework will result?""For Nim's Fruit Crisps, the variables of Brexit have advanced British self-sufficiency.Previously reliant on a supplier in Belgium for most of its fruits and vegetables, the company has in recent months found domestic suppliers for every needed variety except pineapple, limiting its exposure to the vagaries of exchange rates. Today, Nim's buys apples, parsnips, cucumbers and a range of other crops from British farmers.The fall in the pound has also made Nim's products cheaper outside Britain, bolstering its exports, which now make up more than half of total sales. Nim's snacks are sold in Germany, France, Italy, India, Israel and - soon - Saudi Arabia.""What I've learned is that Europe isn't the only market for us,"" said Raja, whose Nim's business card identifies her as TheBoss.Yet as she seeks to complete a deal putting her crisps on the shelves of a major British supermarket chain, Raja worries that the needed volumes will exceed the capacities of Britain.""I suddenly have to find 100 tons of apples,"" she said.She is scoping out farms in Poland, even as she worries about the value of British money in a world shaped by Brexit.""I have to keep my margins tight,"" she said."

Besides, they are expected to serve three eggs in a week to each student. The government provides only rice to the workers to prepare food and they have to purchase all the ingredients such as oil, tamarind, chilli powder, turmeric, dhania, onions, salt and other food items to be used for preparing curries, apart from eggs and fuel.Big menuThe government is paying Rs. 8.18 paise for each student studying from eight to tenth class and Rs. 6.18 paise for each student from sixth to eighth class and Rs. 4.13 paise for each student from first to fifth class. With the steep increase in prices of all vegetables, including onion, which has crossed Rs. 60 per kilogram, the midday meal workers are forced to cut down on the items on the menu.Before the prices of vegetables increased, we used to serve the food as per menu. But, now it has become very difficult to purchase vegetables and leafy vegetables to prepare curries, said Vasumathi, a midday meal worker of government high school in Karimnagar town.

355,"Demo, one year later. Success or failure?",http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/wxDyTt00PCTYcn5AQSzsEK/Demo-one-year-later-Success-or-failure.html,2017-11-07,Livemint,"Most people have a where I was story about the night of 8 November 2016. Some of us also have a story on how much money I had on the night that Prime Minister Narendra Modi invalidated 86% of Indian currency. I was just dragging myself back home after my Iyengar yoga class (those who join the Beginners will identify with my use of the word dragging), ready to eat some dinner and collapse. But of course, the team and I were up until midnight, reporting and writing on the biggest news of a personal finance journalists lifetime. How much money did I have? I had three Rs500 notes that day. Having moved to cards and then digital, Id moved my household staff to bank accounts and electronic transfer of salaries some years back. Cash was needed for everyday buying of milk, bread, eggs, vegetables kind of stuff. The local Mother Dairy booth was accepting old notes for future purchases, so I was spared the lines to deposit my money. We all have our stories of what happened that night. This was mine.Apart from the personal shock to our money lives, demonetisation quickly became a huge political, social and intellectual battle. The battle lines got drawn deep in the ground and your pro- or anti-Modi stance decided where you stood on the demonetisation debate. I wrote a column one day after demonetisation in which I said that the step will raise the cost of black money, it will not eliminate it. That it is one step in a larger plan to go after corruption. You can read it here: bit.ly/2mmdYeZ. How does it look a year later? Modi gave four reasons for demonetisation: to curb corruption, black money, fake notes and terror finance. To judge the success or failure of demonetisation on these four metrics is almost impossible because demonetisation was one of the several weapons the government has deployed against these issues. But let me try and unpack them.Has there been a dent in corruption and black money? Anecdotal stories say that high-level corruption in the central government is gone, but the cancer of graft elsewhere in the system still thrives. It is unrealistic to expect the deep-rooted habit of graft to disappear overnight, but at least there is serious political will behind the anti-corruption war in India today. What of black money, or money on which income tax has not been paid? Black money is back in the systemtalk to any builder (real estate is the biggest sump of black money and talking to builders is a quick way to figure out if cash deals are back) and they say it is as if demonetisation never happened. But they admit to the cash ratio going down and the fear factor lurking at the back of every deal.Look next at the data on currency in the system and digitisation. Reserve Bank of India data shows that currency held by the public is now down almost 10% as compared to last year. Currency in circulation is down by 17%, says the ministry of finance; this means that more than Rs3 trillion, which was earlier cash in circulation, is now part of the formal financial system. Financialisation of household savings got a hard push with demonetisation with assets of life insurance products and mutual funds showing an uptick post demonetisation, and cash-based real estate is still to recover.Digitisation of transactions is growing with the value of NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) transactions rising from Rs9.5 trillion to Rs12.5 trillion over a year. Digital transactions leave a trail and the more India moves to such transactions, the bigger is the blow to black money.A metric to measure the impact of demonetisation on black money would be tax compliance. Rising tax compliance is a win for the war on corruption. A ministry of finance press release (you can see it here: bit.ly/2y9tRMr) says that the number of returns filed as of August 2017 was up almost 25% compared to an increase of about 10% a year ago. The Economic Survey puts the number of new taxpayers due to demonetisation at about 540,000 in FY17, with a possible rise in returned income at Rs10,587 crore. You can see the table here: bit.ly/2vtrq6W. These are clear short-term gains in tax compliance and will need a sustained effort to keep the momentum going.The governments expectation that a chunk of the cash will not come back and therefore will hurt the corrupt disproportionately did not play out the way it was forecast. Almost all of the notes returned to the system as brazen operators found ways to game the system using a mix of dirty bankers, Jan Dhan accounts, poor people who lined up for them, shell companies and false invoices to justify the cash. A cat-and-mouse game began to catch the bad guys. The government changed track and used the money deposited to identify disproportionate assets. Deposit data was used by the tax department to identify people with cash deposits disproportionate to their previous tax returns. The May 2017 status report of Clean Money Operation of the income-tax department (bit.ly/2hONlzU) says that just under 1.8 million people were identified with such deposits; post-verification, over 900 groups were searched and undisclosed income of over Rs16,000 crore admitted. More than 400 cases have been referred to the Enforcement Directorate or Central Bureau of Investigation and 56 persons have been arrested. These are tiny numbers today, but it is a start. The box shows some examples of how different categories of people tried to launder money.As the news came that shell companies were being used to launder old currency notes, the ministry of corporate affairs began a crackdown that has resulted in about 224,000 companies being struck off the records for being inactive for two years. Most likely to be shell companies, or companies formed to avoid taxes and launder black money, these firms had their bank accounts frozen. Around 309,000 directors who were on the boards of companies that had not filed returns for three years have been disqualified. (You can read the report here: bit.ly/2zmRVgh). The same report mentions a preliminary enquiry showing that Rs17,000 crore had been deposited and withdrawn during the demonetisation process. It is small potatoes in a country where the parallel economy is supposed to be almost equal the formal one and the data in the years to come will show success or failure on this metric. A Mint news report says: Heightened surveillance and a crackdown on black money has led to a three-fold increase in PAN (Permanent Account Number) registrations. You can read the story here: bit.ly/2hMr1qA.What about terror financing and fake notes? In a 20 August 2017 Rajya Sabha written reply, Minister of State for Home Affairs Hansraj Gangaram Ahir said that demonetisation resulted in significant positive impact on most theatres of violence in the country including stone pelting incidents in J&K (Jammu and Kashmir). Since illegally held cash forms the major chunk of terrorist funding, after the demonetisation, most of the cash held with the terrorists turned worthless. Demonetisation also led to instant extinguishment of Pakistan-printed high quality Fake Indian Currency Notes. It also adversely affected the hawala operators. But this is government spin, is it not? Heres the thing, we cant be selective in accepting government data or information in written replies in Parliament. If we believe government data when the growth rates fall, we should equally believe it when the data shows a positive trend. Government claims can be verified, but we cannot paint all government data as fudged, or be selective with what we want to agree with. Google stone pelting and see how the incidence of this form of attack against the armed forces in Kashmir has gone down drastically.So was Demo a success or a failure? Look at Demo in isolation and count the human cost of the few months without cash and the shock to the economyit failed. Step back and see Demo as part of a larger plan to weed out corruption, with it being just one weapon in an armoury that has the freshly empowered the Benami Transaction Act, digitization of money, linking Aadhaar to benefits and transactions, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Bankruptcy Act, and a different story begins to emerge.Narendra Modi took a huge political risk with Demo by doing something that would affect each person and not just one section and with that he pressed the reset button on corruption. For a deeply corrupt nation, any anti-corruption move has to be multi-pronged and results will take at least half a decade to play out. But the early successes are showing up in the data.The Tom and Jerry showThese are two examples from the 10 given by the tax department that give the methods adopted for conversion of unaccounted cash by various categories of people.Hyderabad-Based Doctor: The doctor was found to have deposited more than Rs11 crore in specified bank notes after 8 November 2016 in three bank accounts. During questioning, the individual could not provide any document to substantiate the source of the deposits, which was later admitted as undisclosed income. Prohibitory orders were initially placed on the bank accounts, which were later lifted and a sum of Rs7.50 crore was seized.Demonetisation also forced government employees to deposit unaccounted cash in their bank accountsGovernment employee in Bhubaneswar: A government employee was searched on the basis of information on unexplained cash deposits into the accounts maintained with various banks in his own name as well as in the name of his family members. Investigations also revealed that his wife, a homemaker with no ascertainable sources of income, had purchased land in Bhubaneswar by making a cash payment of Rs53 lakh, the sources of which could not be explained. A total cash of Rs2.28 crore has been seized in this case. The matter has also been referred to the state vigilance department.Source: Operation Clean Money Status report May 2017.Monika Halan works in the area of consumer protection in finance.

Photo: MintNew Delhi: With major crop prices plunging below minimum support prices (MSPs), farmers are likely to lose an estimated Rs35,968 crore in earnings for the kharif season, a coalition of farmers organizations said on Thursday.In the two weeks to 7 November, farmers have incurred a loss of Rs6,283 crore, having sold crops at lower than their support price, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a coalition of over 180 farmer unions, said.The AIKSCC numbers on loss to farm incomes were arrived at after a comparison of average wholesale prices in mandis (regulated farmer markets) and MSPs announced by the centre. The analysis was done for seven major kharif (summer) cropspaddy, maize, bajra, soybean, groundnut, cotton and uradby taking into account market arrivals and a weighted average of modal prices in major growing states.After four droughts, farmers have been hit by three successive seasons of low crop prices, the coalition said in a statement. The estimates, it added, are conservative as the actual prices at which farmers are selling their produce are often lower than official wholesale prices.The coalition also said, citing data published by the agriculture ministry, that for several crops the government-fixed MSPs are lower than the cost of production as calculated by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. These include crops like jowar where the support price is 19% lower than the cost of production and pulses like moong for which the MSP is 2% lower than the production cost.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised before the 2014 general election that MSPs will be fixed at 50% above the cost of production. However, of the 14 kharif crops, the MSPs of seven have been fixed lower than the (C2 or comprehensive) cost of production, the coalition said. Assuming an MSP at 50% over costs, farmers will lose an estimated Rs2 trillion going by current mandi prices, the coalition said.The government has set a target to double farmer incomes (by 2022), but even after successive years of normal rains their losses are mounting, said Yogendra Yadav, a farmers leader and a member of the coalition. Our estimate does not take into account losses suffered by growers of horticulture crops like potatoes and onion for which there are no MSPs but farmers are selling at a loss, Yadav added.Analysts agreed with the farmers analysis.The actual losses to farmers may be a little lower on account of government procurement of crops like paddy, but overall the analysis is fair, said Himanshu, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, and a Mint columnist. There is little doubt that crop prices are plunging and that is due to a serious demand deflation in the economy.The coalition also unveiled a social media campaign. AIKSCC which has been at the forefront of farmer agitations across several states, also announced a farmers protest in Delhi on 20 November with demands for remunerative prices and loan waivers."
357,Farm poser over crop marketing,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/farm-poser-over-crop-marketing-184459?ref=bihar-new-stry,2017-11-09,Telegraph,"Sanjeev Kumar VermaFARM TO PLATEPatna: Sumant Kumar, a farmer from Darveshpura village in Nalanda district who set a world record in paddy cultivation by achieving a productivity level of 22.4 tonnes per hectare in 2011, is a worried person.His paddy crop is ready but he does not know where to market the produce.""I have to undertake potato cultivation after harvesting of the paddy crop. I would need capital for that and hence want to sell my paddy crop soon. As there is not much support from the state government on this front I might end up selling the paddy at whatever price would be offered in the local market,"" he told The Telegraph while sharing his expectations from the third agricultural roadmap of Bihar that would be released by President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday.He wants the government to take care of the marketing aspect of agriculture produce on a priority basis for the welfare of the farmers.Nitish Kumar, another farmer from the same district who had set a world record in potato production in 2012 by achieving a productivity level of 72.9 tonnes of potato per hectare, too echoed Sumant and said: ""Marketing of produce is the biggest challenge facing Bihar farmers. The roadmap should take care of this aspect.""Nitish also underlined the need of timely delivery of the benefits that are part of the roadmap.Sanjiv Kumar, a progressive farmer from Hajipur in Vaishali district, had a mixed opinion about the two agricultural roadmaps that have been implemented so far.He said: ""While a lot of pro-farmer works were done in the first roadmap (2008-12) the second one (2012-17) got entangled in red tape. One hopes that the latest roadmap would keep farmers in the centre and would minimise bureaucratic interference in the delivery of the benefits.""Rajkumari Devi of Anandpur village in Muzaffarpur district too appears to be a disappointed soul.""The two roadmaps promised a lot to the farmers but the percolation of benefits on the ground has not been very effective. Farmers do get fertilisers, seeds etc on time and several of them also started mechanised farming due to the support announced by the state government, but procuring the subsidy for these items really becomes a tough ask for them,"" said Rajkumari, who is popularly called Kisan Chachi by the locals in the north Bihar district for helping them in doing scientific farming.Amid these voices of concern, there is a silver lining as well for the state government - evident from the assertion of Devendra Yadav of Basopatti in Madhubani district.""Farmers have gained a lot after implementation of the two agricultural roadmaps. My paddy crop could survive the flood fury this year as I had followed the advice of agriculture department officials who extend their services on a regular basis,"" he said.Confronted with the voices from the ground, agriculture minister Prem Kumar said: ""Steps are being taken for timely procurement of crops in a very transparent manner. Farmers facing any problems on this issue should approach us and their problem would be solved at any cost.""Reacting to the farmers' refrain over non-delivery of extension services, the minister said special steps were being taken to ensure presence of field officials in villages and soon rosters would be made for this purpose.The agriculture minister is also planning to hold an interactive session with farmers after the release of the roadmap and this would be used for collecting feedback from the stakeholders for effective implementation of the works that constitute the roadmap."
358,Vegetable prices continue to soar in Rourkela,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/nov/13/vegetable-prices-continue-to-soar-in-rourkela-1699631.html,2017-11-13,The New Indian Express,"ROURKELA: In what may be called as double trouble for consumers, the prices of onions and other vegetables continue to soar across the district. With onions selling at `40 per kg, the consumers are now feeling the pinch after prices of different vegetables soared between `40 and `100 per kg.In such a scenario, officials of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) department have once again linked the price rise to the problem of limited supply at the source point in Nashik in Maharashtra. There are no reports of hoarding of onions by local wholesalers. We are monitoring the situation. If needed, onions will be sold through Government fair price shops, Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) A Barik said. In July, when onion prices had jumped to `28 per kg, the department had opened 37 fair price shops across the city.If onions were not enough to bring tears to the eyes of locals, vegetables added to their woes. While green peas were sold at `100 per kg, capsicum and carrot were priced at `80 per kg at the markets across Rourkela on Sunday, sources said. Pointed gourd, cauliflower, bean and seam were priced at `60 per kg each. Tomatoes and spinach were priced at `50 per kg, while brinjal, plantain, ladys finger, ridge-gourd and bitter-gourd sold at `40 per kg. Ginger and garlic were selling at `100 and 60 per kg, respectively, sources said, adding that the price of green chilli came as a surprise at `80 to `100 per kg.Amid the soaring prices, sweet potatoes, cow-pea, pumpkin, radish, papaya, cucumber and some local varieties of greens were available for `20 to `30 per kg. Potatoes came as a major relief, selling at `10 per kg, sources added. Usually, by this time of the year, vegetable prices should have decreased. The crisis can be attributed to the lack of locally-grown vegetables in the markets. I hope the arrival of new vegetables to Rourkela city from Nuagaon, Bisra block, Kuarnmunda and Lathikata blocks of the district besides from adjacent pockets of neighbouring Jharkhand will bring down prices, a local vendor, Subal Barik, said."

363,Rain shadow on veggie prices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-shadow-on-veggie-prices/articleshow/61730261.cms,2017-11-21,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: Unseasonal rain that had hit Bengal last week may have receded but its impact is still being felt across Kolkata markets. While the showers are responsible for pulling down prices of a handful of vegetables , it has adversely affected the stocks of others, thereby burning a hole in consumers' pockets.Over the last few days, prices of cabbage and cauliflower have dropped sharply, thanks the low-pressure triggered rain. Wholesalers have resorted to distress sale to clear the cabbage-cauliflower stock damaged by the rain.But buyers are not so lucky when it comes to other vegetables. Prices of some staple vegetables have remained consistently at or above Rs 50/kg. This is bit unusual if you look at previous years. By this time last year, vegetable prices nosedived sharply.According to sources, rain has delayed harvesting of winter vegetables in Bengal, forcing the state to depend on other states. Consumers, subsequently, are bearing the price burden. ""Most of the winter vegetables we are now getting is coming from outside. Peyajkoli (Scallion), which is coming from Karimpur in Bangladesh , remains pricey. Tomato from Purulia has just started arriving. So, tomato price is likely to crash in two-three days,"" said Kamal Dey, Koley Market vendors association president and Bengal government's market task force member.But the showers have spelt doom for potato. After last year's bumper crop, this year was predicted to be a lean year. But the untimely rain can make it far worse. ""So, potato prices might shoot up unusually,"" said Dey.But what is most striking is the gap between wholesale and retail prices. ""Around 20% is the reasonable gap between wholesale and retail prices, if you take into account transportation cost, waste and local market levy by trading associations. But in case of most of the vegetables, the difference is between 60% and 80%,"" said Anubrata Chatterjee, an agro-retail economist.The government should put up a board at every municipal market to publicize wholesale prices so that a consumer knows whether the retail vendor is asking for too much, advised Dey. An aware consumer can always bring down the price of vegetables at a reasonable level.Last week's rain has hit the prime vegetable producing districts like South 24 Parganas, East, Bankura, Hooghly and Howrah hard. In South 24 Parganas, 8,242 hectares have been affected, followed by East Midnapore (6,984 hectares), Bankura (4,380 hectares) and Hooghly (1,544 hectares),"" said an agriculture department officer."

Given the glut, many farmers have already abandoned their potato stocks in cold storages as there are no signs of price recovery.Farmers say ideally a 50kg sack of potatoes should be priced Rs 380, but they are getting only Rs 50 for it in the wholesale markets. ""There are trollies full of potatoes as villagers are offering to sell potatoes at as low as Rs 2 per kg. After the state government failed to provide any relief, farmers had dumped potatoes in Mohali last month. With no solution in sight, many farmers plan to dump potatoes in the rivers in the coming weeks,"" said Harinder Singh , general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal).Jang Bahadur Singh Sangha, secretary general of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers (POSCON), suggested the Centre should have intervened after the crisis began after demonetisation. ""The solution lies in concrete steps such as setting up Potato Board , involving think tanks for long-term policies and getting rid of randomness in policy so that initiatives to export potatoes can work. The international community is expecting from us, but archaic steps like fixing minimum export price hold the farmers back.""The bad run for potato farmers started last year as 70% of the crop was pushed into cold storages and potato seed buyers from West Bengal did not turn up. Desperate farmers have been forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices to dairy owners."

A kg of good quality onions now costs Rs 65-Rs 70 in Bengaluru's retail markets Decreased supply and increasing demand have sent the prices of onions and shallots (small onions) soaring, say farmers and traders. Even shallot prices have doubled; they range from Rs 160 to Rs 170 in the open market. Such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from North Karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.On an average, Bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. Now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from Hubballi and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the Bangalore Onion Traders Association . As a result, a kg of onion which was available at Rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs Rs 70. And in another one week, it may cross Rs 80, fear traders.In the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at Hubballi APMC, Asia's largest wholesale market for onions. Modal prices have been hovering at Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.North Karnataka districts, including Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi and Raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of Karnataka's onion demand. The state gets the remaining 25 per cent from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.""Normal supply of onion is possible only after farmers take up rabi cultivation and after resumption of road communication, which may take another one or two months,'' said Wahab Mulla, general secretary, Onion and Potato Merchants Association M K Patil, a senior horticulture officer said the prices of onions are expected to stabilize as the Centre has decided to impose a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne on onions to increase domestic supply and check rising costs. They have also asked public sector body Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) to import 2,000 tonnes of onions in order to check prices in local markets.Market sources expect a further increase in onion prices as the supply from North Karnataka is unlikely to be resumed soon. Other vegetables whose prices have shot up during the past couple of days include carrot, coriander leaves, cauliflower, cabbage, beans and tomato."

Vishwanath said the price rise was owing to a fall in supply.The production season for onions is over in the State and we have been procuring the vegetable from Nasik. But, owing to heavy rain in Nasik, farmers have been unable to harvest the crop and supply it to Karnataka, resulting in price rise.

Instead of sowing in June, most farmers in the Chitradurga-Hubballi-Belagavi belt sowed onion in the second half of August.But the first sowing was ruined, as heavy rain led to water stagnation in the farms.There was massive crop loss in the second sowing as well owing to rain, bringing down the yield to less than half, he said.Onion harvest season in Karnataka starts from September and the crop floods the local markets till December. However, this year, the crop from Karnataka has almost stopped reaching the markets and now Karnataka is dependant on other States.There is hope that supply will stabilise by the new year when Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh harvest it. A good yield in these States is likely to ensure onion rates below Rs. 40 by new year.This year, sowing of onions was delayed by a month due to delayed monsoons.

Were being talked about again as an armed forces  were really winning.Speaking from a gilded room at his Mar-a-Lago club, Trump said: Were not fighting anymore to just walk around, were fighting to win, and you people are really, youve turned it around over the last three to four months like nobodys seen, and they are talking about it, so thank you very much.Turning to the 74th Expeditionary Fighters Squadron based at the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, Trump suggested the Obama administration hadnt allowed soldiers on the ground to do their jobs. They say weve made more progress against ISIS than they did in years of the previous administration, he said. And thats because Im letting you do your job.Throughout the day  at events and on Twitter  Trump boasted about the economys performance since he took office, pointing to recent stock market gains and the unemployment rate, along with his efforts to scale back regulations and boost military spending. So youre fighting for something real, youre fighting for something good, he told the service membersTrump and his wife, Melania, also made a trip to a nearby Coast Guard station in Riviera Beach, Florida, where they delivered a lunch of turkey sandwiches, giant muffins, heaping baskets of fruit, chips and cookies to men and women on duty for the holidays.During his remarks, Trump, singled out the service for its hurricane relief efforts during Harvey and the other storms that battered the country earlier this year. Theres no brand that went up more than the Coast Guard, Trump told them What a job youve done.Trump praised the superiority of US military equipment, too, yet said he tries to make sure that equipment the U.S. sells abroad  even to allies  is not quite as good as that kept at home. I always say, make ours a little bit better, Trump said. Keep about 10 percent in the bag. He added: You never know about an ally. An ally can turn.Among the equipment admired by Trump is the F-35 stealth fighter jet, which he recalled asking Air Force guys about once. In a fight, you know a fight like I watch on the movies  how good is it? he recalled asking. They said, Well, it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it, even if its right next to it,' Trump recounted, prompting laughs.The F-35, plagued by development problems and cost overruns, is in fact not invisible to people nearby. Its stealth technology is designed to evade detection by radar and other sensors.At the earlier video conference, Trump cleared the room of press after about 10 minutes so he could have very confidential, personal conversations with those on the line. Borrowing a line from his Apprentice days, he told the reporters Youre fired, then wished them a happy Thanksgiving, too.On the Trumps own Thanksgiving menu for family and friends at Mar-a-Lago: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, red snapper, Florida stone crab, baked goods, local produce and cheeses, and a selection of cakes and pies for dessert.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

A vegetable market in Pune.By Rushikesh GawadeWHOLESALE PRICES of vegetables in Pune, which have been on the higher side for the past few weeks, are now on a downward slope. However, the change is yet to be reflected in retail market prices. As compared to the wholesale price of green vegetables last week, the rates have seen a 15 to 42 per cent dip.Vilas Bhujbal, a vegetable wholesaler at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), Pune, said, Following untimely rainfall last week, there has been a decline in the arrival of vegetables in the market. This had led to price rise. Now that the weather is normal, supply is also improving, which is reflecting in the change in prices.Prices of green peas have seen the most significant change, with the present price being at Rs 4,000 per quintal, as against the Rs 5,000 per quintal a week ago.Similarly, the prices of dhania (coriander) have decreased by 28 per cent, methi (fenugreek) by 42 per cent and spinach by 25 per cent. Supply of these vegetables has seen a 12 to 35 per cent rise lately, said Bhujbal.Prices of vegetables in the retail markets, however, are yet to see a change. At the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Market, fenugreek, spinach, shepu (dill) and coriander are still being sold at Rs 10 per bunch.Meanwhile, as wholesale prices of green vegetables have decreased, prices of onion recorded an 18 per cent rise over the week.

370,Cities at Crossroads: Perils of plastics waste,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/plastic-waste-management-polyethylene-bags-perils-of-plastics-waste-4959279/,2017-11-29,Indian Express,"India has had a very long take-back experience of glass bottles for beer and soda-water. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) India has had a very long take-back experience of glass bottles for beer and soda-water. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)Movie buffs will remember the iconic 1967 Hollywood movie, The Graduate, in which Ben, played by a very young Dustin Hoffman, is given career advice by a friend of his parents at his graduation party. Plastics, he is told, there is a great future in plastics. Fifty years later, the spread of plastics bears out the accuracy of that prediction. But our message today would be, plastics are all pervasive and very convenient but we need to worry about food safety, design for recycling, and safe management of non-recyclable plastic waste to ensure environmental protection.Plastic is a synthetic polymer, deriving its name from the Greek word plastikos, which means fit for moulding. It was invented in 1869 by John W. Hyatt, responding to a New York firms offer of $10,000 for anyone who could provide a substitute for ivory. The subsequent 150 years have seen chemical companies develop many new polymers and many different types and grades of plastic.This inexpensive, light, and versatile product enters our everyday lives in numerous forms ranging from bread wrapping, magazine and invitation covers, and packages of many ordinary consumption items at one end and also as part of television sets, refrigerators, cars and aircraft at the other. The problem is that plastic does not decay. It sticks around in the environment as deadweight. Recycling of plastic is, therefore, extremely important, and waste management systems and product design explicitly need to facilitate plastic recycling. Worldwide, only 14 per cent of plastic is collected for recycling, while the rest stays in the environment causing pollution both on land and in the ocean.As regards food safety, consumers need to understand which plastics meet the criteria. Among the many choices available, while PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) and HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) are generally considered safe in not leaching any chemicals, there are concerns with regard to PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) which need to be addressed. The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 Sec 4(b) explicitly state that only virgin plastic is to be used for storing, carrying, dispensing or packaging food stuff which is ready to eat or drink. However, enforcement remains a challenge.Recycling of plastics is not always economically and/or technically feasible. Composites like roofing sheets, bonded rubberised coir mattresses, etc are really difficult to recycle when the components are hard to separate. The solution lies in instituting extended producer responsibility laws under which their take-back and disposal by manufacturers should be mandatory.Plastic sachets used for packaging of snack-foods like potato chips can also not be recycled. These sachets are composed of three to seven thin layers of different plastics glued together to keep air and water vapour out and retain odours and freshness. These could be recycled if all the layers were thermoplastic (like polythene and polypropylene) which soften into lumps and granules upon heating. They become non-recyclable because of an inner layer of thermoset plastic (nylon or polyester) which does not soften on heating but chars instead, blocking the filter screens and requiring the shutdown of heating equipment every few minutes. Even plastic-coated paper cups and/or stationery pose problems for recycling.Appeals to snack-food packagers to use recyclable multi-films are often countered by the argument that the new (non-recyclable) material extends the shelf-life for snack-foods from six months to one year. But should we want one-year-old biscuits or chips at the cost of a city littered with uncollected food sachets? Moreover, the cost of collecting and transporting this light fluffy waste to an energy-recovery plant exceeds any possible gain from energy recovery.Section 9(3) of the Plastics Waste Management Rules 2016 requires the phase out of non- recyclable multi-layered plastic by March 2018, while Section 17 requires manufacturers, producers and users of non-recyclable packaging to either pay municipalities for the cost of managing such waste, or arrange to take it back and manage its disposal themselves.India has had a very long take-back experience of glass bottles for beer and soda-water. Shopkeepers would give a discount on new purchases if old bottles were returned. In the US, there is a printed refund value (different for every state) of 5 to 10 cents for return of aluminium cans, glass bottles, PET bottles and containers of soft drinks. Unfortunately, hardly any Indian city has actually taken advantage of our highly beneficial Rule 17. Municipal corporations can ask all major snack-food brands to provide the city with equipment for shredding snack sachets into 2-4 mm tea-powder-like flakes and for transport of the shredded flakes to hot-mix plants. In our October column, we had highlighted how plastic waste can be used for strengthening roads by adding such flakes to hot stones to form a baked-on polymer primer coat. The excellent bonding with added bitumen gives 2-3 times longer life to tar roads.PET bottles have enjoyed high recycling value for making into flakes and then fibre, after removing bottle caps, rings and labels, and sorting by colour. Here too purity of the collection stream is the key. At one time, almost all PET bottle-waste from around the world ended up in China. Some years ago, US anti-dumping duty on Chinese T-shirts and knitwear made from recycled PET-based fibre caused a crash in the price of PET bottles for waste-pickers in India. It remains to be seen what will happen with the recent cutback on PET bottle imports by China.PVC was one of the earliest plastics to be invented, but is now banned in many cities, states and even countries. It is used in water pipes, wiring cables and also beverage bottle labels, flexes, etc. It contains 57 per cent chlorine by weight, which like other chlorine-like (halogenated) plastics, releases deadly dioxins and furans when burnt. The National Green Tribunal has now asked the Ministry of Environment to consider and pass rules phasing out short-life PVC.Major short-life PVC items like PVC hoardings and banners, flex and posters are almost invariably burnt in the open in Indian cities and contribute heavily to air toxicity. These items are largely imported from China which has banned their use in China but allows the same to be produced and exported to countries with lax environmental rules.Another troublesome waste is expanded polystyrene, known more generally as thermocol which is a brand name. This is widely used by packaging industry for packing large items like TVs and tiny ones like cell-phones. Though theoretically recyclable as polystyrene, here too its light weight makes collection and transport for recycling and even take-back uneconomical. The West and Far East have solved this problem by switching to wonderfully creative and recyclable alternatives: Moulded papier-mch, folded cardboard, expanded paper, bubble-wrap, air bags, compostable peanuts for loose-fill packaging and much more.The plastic menace for Indian cities is compounded because of their generally poor state of solid waste management and the poor infrastructure for sewerage and stormwater drainage. Developing eco-friendly consumption habits such as avoiding disposable catering items and using washable cups and plates instead, will make a difference, but plastics will continue to play an important role in our lives. A sustainable way forward is to minimise consumption of disposable/single use plastic items, create awareness about the use of appropriate grade of plastic for different purposes, and emphasise the importance of recycling and reusing plastic.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
371,In cotton belt  a touch of discontent,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-cotton-belt-rising-wisps-of-discontent/article21153648.ece,2017-11-30,The Hindu,"Gangaram Patel, a 50-year-old farmer at Kalyanpar village in Morbi district, grows cotton and groundnut on four hectares of his land. For the past 22 years, he has been a BJP voter.However, this time, Mr. Patel says, he will change his voting preference because the party has done little for farmers.In this area, we have always voted for the BJP but not now. We farmers have been ruined by this government. They are only concerned about some industrialists, an angry Mr. Patel says, standing on his farm on the Morbi-Rajkot highway.The main issue is the poor prices of cotton and groundnut for the past three years.For the past several years, we are not getting remunerative prices; so farming has become a burden. Today, cotton fetches Rs. 800 to Rs. 900 per 20 kg, while our production cost is almost Rs. 1,000, if we include labour and input costs, he says.Farm distress is emerging as one of the important factors in the Assembly elections in Gujarat. The State is the largest producer of cotton and groundnut, which take up the largest cultivation area. In the current year, cotton has been cultivated on 26.41 lakh hectares and the expected production is 1.25 crore bales. Groundnut has been grown on 16 lakh hectares and 26 lakh tonnes is expected.Paresh Ujaria, a farmer with about 1.5 hectare of land and local Youth Congress activist, says farmers in the cotton belt are in distress. The prices of seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, power and labour have gone up. Today, one labourer charges Rs. 300 a day, while prices of our produce have stagnated for the past several years, making farming a loss-making proposition, he says.Babubhai Vasoya, a 52-year-old farmer at Thebachda village near Rajkot, echoes the same sentiments. I want to ask Modi [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] where is the Rs. 1,500 [per 20 kg] for cotton that he promised in 2014? In 2017, we are not getting what we used to get in 2011-12, when cotton price was Rs. 1,200 to Rs. 1,300 per 20 kg, Mr. Vasoya says.Gauravsinh Jadeja of the village says farm distress is sweeping across the region. Similar is the situation in every district of Saurashtra. You go to Jamnagar, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Botad and you will see poor farmers crying for better prices for their produce, he says.In North Gujarat, farmers face a similar predicament as they are not realising remunerative prices for potato, a major crop in Banaskantha, Patan and Gandhinagar.Farmers are forced to sell potato at Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 a kg against their production cost of Rs. 5 and cold storage costs. They need at least Rs. 10 a kg to make a little profit, says Ramanbhai Patel, a farmer and cold storage owner from Deesa in Banaskantha."

Traders said tomatoes cost Rs. 40 per kg due to shortage in supply, while onions were at Rs. 35 per kg. Rising prices of both vegetables over the past four weeks has inconvenienced both consumers and sellers alike, traders said.Officials at the APMC said both crops were hit by unseasonal rain, pushing the wholesale prices of tomato to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40 per kg, and to between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in retail outlets. Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location. With the onion crop severely hit in Karnataka, the neighbouring State is depending almost completely on supply from Nashik. Of the 300 trucks of onions entering Bengaluru APMC, over 250 are from Nashik.Ashok Walunj, former director, onion and potato division, APMC, said supply has improved since Wednesday. Around 245 trucks of onion arrived on Thursday and Friday, pushing prices down. Were expecting a fresh stock of onions on Monday. This will bring down the rates further. Within a weeks time, rates will regularise to Rs. 15 to Rs. 20.Tomato, which usually costs between Rs. 18 to Rs. 25 per kg, was being sold at Rs. 45 per kg at the APMC on Friday. Shankar Pingle, former director, vegetables division, APMC, said. Usually, the tomato season starts by mid-October, bring prices down. This time, the tomato crop has been affected by rains in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in September. During the same time last year, tomatoes cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg.Anil Rai, who is among the top tomato dealers in the market, said, On an average, 100 trucks would come to the APMC, each bearing 10 tonnes of tomatoes. This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough. As per APMC records, the vegetables division received around 40 vehicles of tomatoes on Friday.Mr. Rai added that as the tomato crop cycle is of 90 days, farmers have sown again and this produce is expected in the next 15 to 20 days. This will bring down rates further."
373,"From Plate to Plough: Agri-futures, like China",http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-plate-to-plough-agri-futures-like-china-4968066/,2017-12-05,Indian Express,"(Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh) (Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh)In November, prices of most major kharif crops crashed below their respective minimum support prices (MSPs), triggering farm distress. One of the many reasons behind this situation is that planting decisions of our farmers are based on last years prices, rather than the prices expected at the time of harvest. Signals indicating future prices are largely absent as agri-futures have been decimated by excessive controls and regulation. It is time to think afresh and resurrect agri-futures in India.In 2003, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments decisions to allow futures markets in India  after a long gap  was hailed as a big and bold step towards better price discovery for farmers. This, in turn, was supposed to help farmers take informed planting decisions. In the initial years  2003-2007  agri-futures did show promising growth. But around 2007-2008, they were hit by the global food price crisis. Agri-futures picked up momentum again and peaked in 2011-2012. However, since then, there has been heavy government intervention in agri-futures with higher margin requirements as well as absolute suspensions, resulting in their near collapse.Chinese agri-futures have had a contrasting trajectory. The agri-futures market was introduced in the early 1990s in China. It struggled for a decade, but thereafter Chinese agri-futures had such a robust growth that by 2016, it was at the top of global chart, crossing the 1,000 million mark, dwarfing Indias 20 million contracts in the process.What lessons can India learn from China in order to promote its agri-futures and help its farmers in better price discovery? Very briefly, China experimented with several things, including inviting experts from the Chicago Board of Trade in the US, rationalising commodities and exchanges by closing down trade in many items and focusing on a few farm products, especially the less sensitive ones. However, to understand Indias story better, we need to look at the perceptions and actions of three key stakeholders: Policy-makers, regulators (FMC/SEBI), and commodity exchanges. A pre-requisite for the development of a agri-futures market is to have a stable policy environment.The government, including the regulator, should provide a favourable environment for the futures trade to flourish. Commodity exchanges have to invest in designing appropriate contracts for business development. Abrupt interventions, with frequent changes in stocking restrictions on private trade, have reduced the prospects of agri-futures in India. We collated information about various interventions related to margins and suspensions since 2003 and found that suspensions of agri-futures, as well as high margins, have been targeted more towards commodities that are perceived as sensitive in the common mans food basket (See graph). For example, tur, urad, rice have been suspended for more than a decade now. High margins for sensitive commodities, for example, 100 per cent for potato (August 2014), 95 per cent for chana (June 2016) and 70 per cent for sugar (September 2016) reflect the governments intention of blocking their futures trade.So, if one has to develop agri-futures in India, the first lesson is to stay away from sensitive commodities (for example, common rice, wheat, most pulses, and even sugar), at least for some time, till futures gain momentum and some depth. It would be prudent to focus on less sensitive commodities like oilseed complex (oilseeds, meals, and oils), feed (maize), cotton, basmati rice and spices. Once markets are developed and the regulator has a higher degree of comfort, the country can diversify to other commodities in the agri-futures portfolio. This is what China also seems to have done. The largest volumes in agri-futures have come from oilseeds. This points to the significance of the regulators role: Giving a clear direction in terms of the choice of commodities, and then staying the course by adopting a stable policy with minimal interventions.Second, for the government to be assured that speculators are not rigging markets, the regulator should allow only delivery-based contracts, at least till markets deepen. This is another lesson from the Chinese experience: All agri-commodities traded at the Dalian Commodity Exchange are physical-delivery based.Third, like its Chinese counterpart, the government of India should encourage state trading enterprises (STEs) to trade on the agri-futures platform. This will boost the governments confidence in agri-futures as it will have ample information from its STEs. In China, STEs, the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) for example, have a major presence in the agri-futures markets. COFCO is directly administered by Chinas State Council and is the largest food processor, manufacturer and largest exporter and importer in the country. It trades in agri-commodities like soybean oil and meal, palm oil, cotton and sugar in the futures market. Indias STEs like the MMTC, STC, PEC or even the FCI can participate on the agri-futures platform in a similar manner, helping it to deepen.Lastly, it has to be recognised that developing agri-futures is as much the responsibility of the regulator as that of commodity exchanges, and both need to work in harmony for the benefit of various stakeholders, especially farmers who need useful information about future prices for their products while they are planting those crops. Can the Narendra Modi government take bold decisions to revive the legacy of the Vajpayee government and scale new heights in agri-futures, say 200 million contracts by 2022? Remember, China crossed the billion mark in 2015.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Unemployment allowance up to Rs 4,000 per month has also been promised. In private companies, 80 per cent jobs will be reserved for locals.The urban poor will get meals at concessional rates under the Indira Canteen Scheme. Such a plan is already being implemented in Congress-ruled Karnataka. For farmers, apart from loan waiver, the manifesto promises remunerative support prices, free water for irrigation and bonus for special crops like cotton, groundnut, potato and onion.One of the main demands of the teaching community - withdrawal of contractual outsourcing and a fixed salary structure - has been accepted. Social security measures for the unorganised sectors and a robust legal framework to protect the Dalits' rights have also been promised.On the benefits for the Patidars, the manifesto says: ""We will pass a bill in the Assembly under Article 46 of the Constitution and keeping in view the provisions under Article 31(C). Under the bill, communities specified under Article 46 and which have not received any benefit under Article 15(4) & 16 (4), to give them equal opportunities for education and economic development, will be conferred all the rights, given OBC status under this special category.""The Congress has struck a deal with Patidar leader Hardik Patel by promising these special measures. A development package and special drive for education and social development of OBCs have also been promised.Advertisement barThe Election Commission has ordered that no newspaper ads should be published on December 8 and 9 in Gujarat without its prior clearance, a policy adopted after controversial ads were issued by the BJP in the 2015 Bihar polls. The first phase of the Gujarat polls will be held on December 9."

As the BJP tries to win back its loyal supporters, Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitinbhai Patel speaks in the midst of hectic campaigning in Mehsana.The Patidar factor or their anger seems to be your biggest challenge. Whats your assessment?When the agitation began, there was more support. However, we have been able to address the issues by starting new schemes for non-reserved categories, including Patidars.For example, when a boy or a girl who takes admission to a self-financing college or a government institution, the Gujarat government pays 50% of the tuition fee. It covers engineering or medical colleges.When a rural student stays in a hostel, the government now pays up to Rs. 1,200 of the food bill. From primary to Class 12 students, books and uniforms are given by the government. Earlier, these used to be given to only students of SC and ST but we have done away with the distinction.After Congress leader Kapil Sibal offered a formula for reservation to PAAS leaders, your comment that a foolish formula had been offered to fools became controversial, as insulting your community.I had said the Supreme Court, through various judgments, has made it clear that there can be no reservation beyond the existing ceiling (50% reservation limit). Despite knowing this, a well-known lawyer like Kapil Sibal had offered a formula. He himself knows that it will be struck down in one appeal. But to take political advantage, he misled everyone. The Congress, even till this minute, has still not made the formula public.When such a big lawyer, after knowing Supreme Court judgments, offers a formula, then it is making fools out of those fellows who are part of their [PAAS] core group. I didnt say anything insulting about our community.The Congress has also questioned your development model and has alleged that vikas has gone mad. Your response?If they are fighting an election, they have to say something for campaigning. You are travelling around the State and you must have seen how good the roads are. Look at our power situation, look at our water supply or our agriculture. We have the best of best infrastructure in Gujarat. Whether it is a tribal village or a remote part of the State, every part has good connectivity and good infrastructure.Rahul Gandhi is campaigning hard in Gujarat this time. His rallies are being well attended and it is being said that people are listening to what he has to say. How do you view it?Even in this small village, people of all ages have come  from children to seniors. So people come to see him as well but it does not mean that they will vote. And the Congress also gets people from outside to fill its meetings. When a leader or an actor comes, people come to see them but it doesnt mean they will get support. Even during Indira jis time there used to be people. Sonia Gandhi also used to come to Gujarat frequently yet we have been ruling the State for 22 years. In recent times, they have lost eight State elections and more recently, they got wiped out in Uttar Pradesh. Last week, in civic polls, they lost even Amethi that has been with them for the last 50 years.Mr. Gandhi hasnt said anything about that. It is clear that people these days want to see work and not go by name alone.The Congress and Mr. Gandhi have raised the issue of price rise or monghvari in Gujarati and people are connecting with the issue. Whats your take?Price rise has two aspects. A farmer wants good price for his produce and the consumer wants the same at minimum price. As a government, it is our responsibility to manage both. Many a time when there is a temporary surge, it naturally applies to all equally. It is not as if prices have gone up because there is a BJP government in Gujarat. In Karnataka, there is a Congress government and tomatoes, potatoes and onions would be similarly priced. Or in Kerala where there is a Communist government, prices of vegetables would be similar.How many seats will the BJP get in these elections?We have already accepted the challenge of 150 plus seats. We have done good work and peoples faith and support are with us.You dont think there is anti-incumbency?We dont have anti-incumbency as we have delivered. Governments that dont work start feeling anti-incumbency but our ministers, MLAs, workers all go and work among the people. Nobody can tell us that we have come to the people after five years. We firmly believe that we will get 150 seats.If they [the Congress] are fighting an election, they have to say something for campaigning"
378,Fields of despair,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-farmers-rural-economy-bjp-fields-of-despair-4973039/,2017-12-08,Indian Express,"Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh) Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh)Bharat vs India, a phrase coined by Charan Singh to describe the conflict between villages and cities, remains relevant. This is evident from the Kisan Sansad (farmers parliament) that met in Delhi last month. More than 40,000 peasants belonging to 180 farmers organisations came together to form the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. According to the National Sample Survey, the average Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) in 1993-94 was Rs 281 in rural India and Rs 458 in urban India. It rose to Rs 772 (up 174 per cent) and Rs 1,472 (up 221 per cent) for rural and urban India respectively in 2007-08, which means that the gap between rural and urban jumped from 63 to 91 percentage points. The gap diminished somewhat between 2007-08 and 2011-12, with rural MPCE reaching Rs 1,430 (up 85 per cent) as an average and the urban rising to 2,630 (up 79 per cent), but it remained more than 20 percentage points higher than what it was in 1993-94 at 84 percentage points.This is partly due to the slow growth of agriculture over the last decade. Between the years 2005-06 and 2011-12, the average annual growth rate of industry at constant 2004-05 prices has been 7.5 per cent, while services grew at an ever-quicker pace, 9.95 per cent. However, agriculture lagged behind at 3.8 per cent. In the following three years, 2012-2015, the average agricultural GDP growth rate was 1.7 per cent. In 2014-15, the growth rate of agriculture was negative at  0.2 per cent. It was only 1.1 per cent in 2015-16 and, thanks to a good monsoon, about 4 per cent in 2016-17, the growth rate the five-year plan considered as necessary to ensure food security.Different factors are responsible for these changes. First, the size of holdings has shrunk over the years: The average land owned by peasants fell from 0.725 ha to 0.592 ha between 2002-03 and 2012-13. As a result, the proportion of those owning less than one ha increased from 79.7 per cent to 82.8 per cent. Since a farm household needs at least 1 hectare of land to make ends meet, over half of the farmers are in debt: The average loan amount for a farm household in India today is Rs 47,000. Second, irrigation has stagnated with less than half of Indian farmland irrigated, partly because of the groundwater crisis: Water tables fell by 65 per cent in 10 years. Third, peasants suffer from one obsession of the government: The price of food. To neutralise any risk of inflation on that front, the growth rate of rural wages has been limited  in 2015, it was the lowest in 10 years (and lower than the inflation rate). That was related to the squeezing of the MGNREGA programme, which was blamed for rising rural wages. But more than wages, food prices were targeted. To spare urban consumers, they were kept low and the government even precipitated food prices deflation by allowing imports. Soyabean is a case in point, when this year market was flooded with cheap soyabean oil imports. Though the government can impose duty up to 45 per cent, but it kept the rate at 12.5 per cent.In 2017 summer, farmers across India started agitating for better prices. They wanted the M.S. Swaminathan Commission report, which recommended minimum support prices, to be implemented. Maharashtra farmers demanded better prices for onions and other pulses; in Himachal Pradesh, it was for tomatoes; in Punjab and Haryana, it was potatoes and maize; in Rajasthan, garlic; in Gujarat, groundnuts; in Madhya Pradesh, soyabean; in Andhra, Telangana and Karnataka, chilli and so on. In June, when Maharashtra farmers, who were on strike, took out a march to Mumbai, the BJP government agreed to a Rs 30,000-crore loan waiver. The protest spread to Madhya Pradesh, where five people were killed in Mandsaur district in police firing. Farmers mobilised also because of demonetisation, which badly affected rural India.Though the agitation fit the traditional pattern of kisan politics, the mobilisations, unlike in the previous decades, achieved little. Loans were waived for peasants, mainly in Maharashtra and UP. However, this measure didnt help much. The procedure to receive reimbursement is bureaucratic and the amount waived is sometimes minimal (Rs 10 to Rs 500). Besides, only a third of the small and marginal farmers have access to institutional credit: Banks do not lend money to the poor. The others turn to money lenders, who do not waive loans. Besides, loan waiver is only a temporary relief.Why did the peasant mobilisations achieve so little? The reason could be the urban consumer bias of the BJP, the new political hegemon. The party has turned its back to the Gandhian dimension of Deendayal Upadhyayas Jana Sangh and is focussed on urban development, as evident from the smart cities flagship programme. It sees industrialisation as the best way to modernise India and create jobs. More urban dwellers supported the party than villagers in the 2014 election  by 10 percentage points, according to the CSDS-Lokniti survey. The urban bias of the government was obvious in its attempt to amend the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2015 in favour of industrialists. When the Opposition forced the government to backtrack, Prime Minister Modi invited the states to reform and the BJP-ruled states were the first to change the law.Budget cuts have reduced the spending on the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and the Integrated Watershed Management Programme and Accelerated Irrigation Benefits and Flood Management Programme. In this context, it isnt surprising that 40 per cent of Indian farmers do not like to farm any more. Hence the demand among young Patels, Marathas, Jats and Kapus for reservations in the (urban) public sector.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Earlier, the vegetable was being sold at a steep Rs. 35 to Rs. 50 per kg. The arrival of 76 trucks and tempos laden with tomatoes from Nashik, Pune, Satara and Karnataka on Friday helped increase the supply in the APMC and significantly lower the price. A total of 711 vehicles, including 125 trucks and 586 tempos, brought vegetables to the APMC market on Friday.However, in the retail market tomatoes continued to be sold at Rs. 60 per kg. The most expensive vegetable at the market was drumstick, which was being sold at Rs. 100 to Rs. 120 per kg. This is in sharp contrast to the usual rate of Rs. 30 to Rs. 45 in the APMC. Shankar Pingle, former director, APMC (vegetable division), said: The rates of drumsticks have been on the rise since November due to unseasonal flash showers in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. There has been a dip in supply from Gujarat and Nashik too, which meet most of the supply in December and January.Meanwhile, the prices of onions which had fallen to Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 on Monday, shot up again to Rs. 30 to Rs. 35 on Friday despite stable supply. Ashok Walunj, former director APMC (onion and potato division) said: Due to Cyclone Ockhi the rates have gone up a bit.

The suicide comes at a time when West Bengal has witnessed a bumper potato harvest for the second year running.The deceased, Golak Bijari Ullal, had taken loans from the Cooperative Bank and moneylenders to grow potatoes on his 20 bigha plot.A resident of Muzaffarpur village in Harimkhola, Golaks son Tarakhnath Ullal said: We have a debt of Rs 5 lakh We had grown potato because the crop had been doing so well. While some of the crop was destroyed because of the untimely rain there were months when there was no rain. But the potato crop itself has done well in the state and thus, the prices plummeted. We couldnt even recover our investment.On Friday morning, finding his fathers room locked, the family called the police. My father did not open the door. The police broke the door and found him hanging, said Tarakhnath.BJPs OBC Morcha state president Sapan Das, who hails from Hooghly, has paid a visit to the family. Blaming the Trinamool Congress government for the death, he said: Farmers are in trouble if crops dont do well they are in trouble even when crops do well. The bumper crop has made the price of potatoes drop. While the market price of potato is substantial even now, farmers dont get this priceThe state government buys the crop from farmers at Rs 6 per kg While the current market price is Rs 8 per kg, the farmers are investing the same amount in the crop So, they are not making any money Middlemen from the ruling party buy the crop at a lower price from farmers and sell it at a higher price. Farmers are thus pushed to commit suicide, he alleged.Pal maintained a healthy price for the farmers is Rs 14 to Rs 15 per kg. The government buys 40 kg of potato for Rs 120 It should instead buy 10 kg at this price, he said. In case of wheat surplus, the crop can be processed and stored. This is not the case with potatoes, as it is perishable. There arent enough storages, which the government is supposed to build. And even when storages are built, these are taken over by TMC workers and middlemen, alleged Pal.Bengal is one of the largest producers of potato in the country with main cultivating areas in Burdwan, Hooghly and Aram-bagh. During 2016 state polls, the Left had raised the issue of farmer suicide. According to CPM, 200 farmers have committed suicide in the last three years in Bengal, with 116 such cases in Burdwan.Kisan Sabha state secretary Amar Haldar said the main cause of farmer suicides is debt. The government has not made the markets easily accessible to farmers. The Left Front used to give a subsidy to farmers for crop cutting. This has been removed by the Mamata government. Moreover, the production cost of crops has increased  prices of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, electricity have increased. The fertiliser subsidy has also been removed.For the first time in 50 years, potato farmers dont have water to irrigate their crops. The crops fail, farmers go to moneylenders and are then unable to pay off their loans, he said.In 2015, 12 potato farmers had committed suicide in Bengal. A bumper harvest of 120 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 led to a similar crisis, resulting in the price of potatoes falling to Rs 3 to Rs 5 per kg. While in 2012, Bengal was not among top five states in terms of suicides, by 2013, it contributed to 9.7 per cent of all suicides. Unlike Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, where the cities recorded highest number of suicides, Kolkata recorded 360 out of a total of 14,310 suicides in 2014, with most suicides taking place in rural Bengal.Despite repeated attempts, Agriculture Minister Ashis Banerjee was not available for comments.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

The introduction of potatoes and the resultant increase in productivity dramatically reduced conflict both within and between states for some two centuries, it says. The researchers, who examined 2,477 battles fought in 899 wars over a 500-year period, drew two key conclusions. The first is linked to the declining value of land on which potatoes are grown.Land value fellAccording to the study, the value of the land on which potatoes were grown fell with advances in productivity. Populations were able to feed themselves on ever smaller amounts of land.Conflicts declined when the value of the object for which one was fighting decreased, the study says.Increases in farmers incomes, often due to much bigger and more reliable harvests, boosted tax revenues for the state, providing added governmental stability and thereby helping to buy the peace, the report states.To risk losing these resources  for workers and for political leaders  represented a financial danger that states were less and less willing to risk, resulting in a decline in peasant revolts and civil wars, the study said.It had become too expensive to engage in combat.The analysis does not detail the impact of specific wars or conflicts but says that most of those studied took place on the borders of modern-day Austria, France, Russia and Turkey. Others were in the Near East and North Africa."
382,Winter rain to delay state potato harvest,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/winter-rain-to-delay-state-potato-harvest/articleshow/62028568.cms,2017-12-12,The Times Of India,"Hooghly: The surprise showers over the last two days have taken a toll on the early variety of potato in vast stretches of West Midnapore, Bankura and Burdwan, forcing farmers to sow seeds afresh. The delay in sowing, along with a projected drop in the total acreage of potato this season, may lead to a supply crunch because the new variety is likely to reach the market earliest by March, instead of February. The notun aloo selling in the retail market now at Rs 25-30 a kilo are those from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Potato grower Chandranath Jana from Bankuras Jaipur said: I took a loan of Rs 10,000 from the rural cooperative to cultivate the tuber on a bigha (one-third acre) of land. The saplings have now all gone under water. The cooperative wont sanction loans unless I repay the earlier one and I now have to borrow from elsewhere to sow the seeds.A rough calculation of the input costs (seeds and fertilizer) and labour shows that a farmer needs Rs 10,000-12,000 per bigha to grow the tuber  costlier than sowing paddy. Yet, farmers took the potato route after incurring loss in the aman paddy because a substantial part of the crop was wasted while harvesting during the downpour. The damage of the early variety of potato will affect the sowing of the regular variety, particularly in the areas of Chandrakona and Garbeta in West Midnapore, Jaipur, Sonamukhi and Bishnupur in Bankura, and Jabalpur and Kalna in Burdwan.However, these are only a portion of the areas that cultivate the early variety. Many farmers in Hooghly and Howrahs Udaynarayanpur didnt go for the early variety sowing after the November rain. The untimely rain has damaged the crop in parts of the entire 4.25 lakh hectares. It didnt have any major effect in Hooghly, which alone produces one-third of the crop. However, the sudden rise in minimum temperature will delay the sowing of the regular variety (jyoti). If it persists, the total acreage of the tuber may fall by 25,000-40,000 hectares this season. Potato needs the chill by December-January for better productivity, said Pradip Majumdar, agro-expert and adviser to the chief minister.The saving grace for consumers is the 17.5 lakh tonnes of potato available in cold storages that can feed Bengal of 5 lakh tonnes a month for the next three months, till the new crop arrives in March. Patitpaban De of the West Bengal Cold Storage Owners Association said the monthly output from Bengal was 7 lakh tonnes. Des claim puts a question mark on the steady supply from cold storages till March, leaving a gap of 15 to 20 days in February when people wont buy the last lot of the stored tuber while the new crop will take some more time to reach the market. Potato, thus, may get expensive for a fortnight at the end of February. But Bengal farmers wont be able to make the fast money. Instead, potato traders from Jalandhar and Amritsar in Punjab, and Farukabad and Agra in Uttar Pradesh are likely to take advantage of the supply crunch."
383,Interest rate hike in focus as inflation falls,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/617559/interest-rate-hike-focus-inflation.html,2017-12-12,Deccan Herald,"Wholesale and retail inflation of 2.17% and 2.18%, respectively, in May makes a great headline for the government, leaving home makers happy too, but it also tells an underlying story of rotting onion, potatoes and other farm produce contributing a great deal to the nationwide crisis among farmers who are up in arms against the government, seeking loan waiver. Breaking it down, the Consumer Food Price Index has slipped into a deflation by 1.05% in May, 2017 from inflation of 7.47% in the same month a year ago. Further, segregation of the data shows nothing but distress being felt by farmers. Prices of vegetables year-on-year fell by 13.44% at the retail level while on a measure of the Wholesale Price Index, prices of veggies fell by over 18%. The situation for pulses growers is even worse with the sub- index falling sharply by close to 20%. With potato prices dropping by whopping 44%, the growers are in real crisis.Ironically, the rural stress has not come about because of drought or any other natural cause, but in a year of plentiful farm produce. Good monsoon last year and a similar weather outlook this year should normally bring smile on the faces of farmers. Instead, they are in distress. Whatever the government may claim about the ill-advised demonetisation, it too has left a trail of disruption in the farm mandis. While the loan waivers may win some reprieve to states, the solution lies elsewhere. The terms of trade must improve in favour of farmers and they cannot be left to the vagaries of the market which is distorted by the hoarders, middlemen and even the governments at times. The governments announce year after year increase in the Minimum Support Price, but makes no adequate arrangements for procurement with the result that the produce rots in the open in the mandis.On the other hand, with private sector operating at much below its existing capacity, the industrial output could grow by a modest 3.1% in April, telling a different story of distress. Indebtedness of large volume has not only been a problem for the borrow-ers but more for the public sector lenders which are not able to resolve the mess of the non-performing assets. Under such a scenario, the only option left is to drastically reduce the policy interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India with the CPI inflation slipping much below the target of 4%. Instead of making it an issue of one-upmanship and autonomy, the Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI should see reason and go for a rate cut without any delay."

Vishal Srivastav Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary at a press conference in Lucknow on Wednesday. Vishal SrivastavLeader of Opposition in the state Assembly Ram Govind Chaudhary on Wednesday accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of provoking and instigating opposition parties and asked him to be mridubhashi (soft-spoken). Chaudhary targeted Adityanath over his statement in the Assembly on Tuesday, when he had indirectly mentioned Congress president Rahul Gandhi speaking about aloo ki factory. Adityanath had said that there is a leader, who does not even know that potatoes are grown on fields, not in factories.While Adityanath had also said that many in the Opposition do not even know the difference between aloo and lauki or mango and sugarcane, Chauduary said, Aap to vipaksha ko khud uksate hain bharkate hain mridubhashi ho jaiye (You provoke and instigate the Oppositionbe a sweet-talker).Chaudhary said that he had raised the issue (of potato farmers) even during the previous Samajwadi Party regime. Lag sakhta hai aloo ka karkhana, said Chaudhary, while pointing out that potato farmers are facing acute crises due to extremely low rates of their crop in the market. He said that the anger of farmers is increasing. Replying to Chaudhary, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state government had taken steps to help potato farmers soon after it had come to power. He added that apart from allowing and promoting export of the crop, farmers were also given exemption from mandi fee and the government had even purchased the crop. He said that the state government has decided to include potato in the midday meal menu of state schools.Congress Legislative Party leader Ajai Kumar Lallu, meanwhile, raised objection to the comment made on the statement of Rahul Gandhi but Treasury benches as well as the Speaker pointed out that no specific name was taken at the Assembly. As the Opposition went on to raise the issue of potato farmers, Adityanath said that his government has worked to give protection to all farmers without any bias. He said that while his government has announced support price for potato farmers for the first time, a three-member committee was also formed to solve their issues, apart from giving them other benefits. The chief minister said that for the first time, potato farmers were given permission to export their produce and orders have been issued to include potato in midday meals as well.Adityanath said that his government kisano ke hiton ko puri tarha se sanrakshan karegi (The government will protect the interest of the farmers in every possible way).At this point, Samajwadi Party MLAs staged a walkout, calling the government kisan virodhi (anti-farmers).Later in the day, Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu demanded discussion on the deaths of children across the state especially in Gorakhpur and staged a walk out over the issue. He said outside the Assembly that he demanded a discussion on the issue of childrens death in Gorakhpur and other districts, but was denied it. The Congress leader said that he would again raise the issue on Thursday.Chaudhary as well senior BSP leader Sukhdev Rajbhar also raised the issue of incorrect information being given by officers in reply to questions asked in the Assembly and requested action in the matter. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna promised to order an inquiry into the matter and take appropriate action against the guilty officers.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Repealing Bill, 2017 was placed in the Assembly on Wednesday. In the written statement of objects and reasons for presenting the bill, Law Minister Brajesh Pathak maintained that, On the recommendation of the central law commission and Ramunujam Committee constituted by the central government, it has been decided to repeal those Acts, which were notified by the central government during Presidents rule in the state and during the British Rule before Independence and have become obsolete and useless. The Acts, which have been repealed include The Police (Agra) Act 1857, The Mirzapur Stone Mahal Act, 1886 and The Uttar Pradesh Appropriation (Vote on account) Acts of 1980, 1993, 1996, 1996, 1997 and 2002 along with The Uttar Pradesh Appropriation Acts of the respective years.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"
