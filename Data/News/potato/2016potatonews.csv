Besides, horticulture production also showed continuous increase unlike foodgrain output which reported a decline in 2014-15 as compared to 2013-14.The figures are part of the horticultural statistics, released by the agriculture ministry on Thursday. The report - Horticultural Statistics at a Glance 2015 - shows that while Maharashtra tops the list of states in terms of leading fruit-producing states, West Bengal is at top in terms of vegetable production in 2013-14.Similarly, Tamil Nadu is the top flower producing state while Gujarat is the leading spices producing state. Tamil Nadu is also at the top in the list of plantation-producing states in the same year.Horticultural crops comprise of fruits, vegetables, plantation crops, flowers, spices and aromatics, while the foodgrains basket contains wheat, rice, coarse cereals, oil seeds and pulses.Noting the consumption pattern, the publication said that the nutritional intake from fruits and vegetables is higher among urban population than that of rural population.Releasing the first issue of such detailed compilation, comprising district-wise statistics of horticultural output in the country, agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh said, ""The data would help policy planners, farmers and other stakeholders"".The publication notes that India has witnessed voluminous increase in horticulture production over the last few years. ""Significant progress has been made in area expansion resulting in higher production"", it says.Data show that fruits and vegetables account for nearly 90% of the total horticulture production in India which is, at present, the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world. The country is, in fact, the leader in several horticultural crops including mango, banana, papaya, cashew nut, areca nut, potato and lady's finger.On the export front, the report notes that grapes occupy the premier position with 107.3 thousand tonnes worth Rs 1,08,649 lakh of exports, followed by banana and mango. Even exports of fresh vegetables have been on the rise.The publication presents a comprehensive picture of the Indian horticulture sector by using statistical data across states, districts and time periods, covering diverse aspects such as area, production, productivity, growth trends, percentage share and value of output for major horticultural crops.Other aspects covered are outlays and expenditure under horticultural activities, monthly series of prices and arrivals over past year in respect of onion, potato and tomato; inputs for horticultural crops; exports and imports; infrastructure availability and India's position in world scenario of horticulture production."

The latter, who were employed with Hotel Mountview, Hotel Parkview and Hotel Shivalikview, have got their retirement benefits withheld.As per an official record, CITCO purchases vegetables worth around Rs 1.50 crore annually for all its units.Similarly, an inquiry probing irregularities in a contract awarded for laundering and drying cleaning of linen in Hotel Parkview had recommended disciplinary action against nine officials in September.The management, however, has initiated action against only eight officials. CITCO Progressive Workers Union has taken up the issue with the management and has demanded action against the remaining employees.There has to be one yardstick. How can they spare a few and punish the others? It seems the management isprotecting the employees against whom no action has not been taken, said Balbir Singh Punni, general secretary of the union.He further said that the union would take up the issue with the home secretary, who is also the chairman of CITCO, if the management failed to take action against the remaining employees.

It is the same old sad story for city residents, as the prices of essential pulses are showing an upward trend yet again. Hamish Gupta, a city-based retailer from Ghumar Mandi, says: ""Though prices have hiked suddenly, it's just a temporary phase. Generally, the prices of pulses are stable in nature. The recent price hike is mainly due to the advent of supermarkets and bulk buyers who create a shortage in the wholesale stock. Such demand creates a rise in prices for retailers.""""It's quite astonishing to see that cooking a meal of four with 'daal chawal' will cost me four times compared to cooking a dish of 'aloo matar' and 'saag'. There used to be time when veggie prices used to fluctuate, and then I used to opt for dal and pulses, but now the situation has reversed,"" says Rashmi Chadda, housewife from Kidwai Nagar. To this, another resident from SBS Nagar, Sushmita Kalra, adds: ""These days, three kg of peas (costing Rs40 per kg) is less than one kg pack of 'arhar dal'. The case is similar for other veggies, be it tomato (Rs40per kg), potato (Rs10 per kg) cauliflower and carrots (Rs15 per kg). The authentic 'sarson ka saag' is just a saviour in such a crisis situation, when one has to decide the menu of a dinner party, especially when budget has to be maintained.""Arhar Dal: 150Maa Dhuli: 180Masar Daal Dhuli: 130Moth Sabat: 110Raungi: 100Channa Dal: 80Black Chaney: 90Maa Sabat: 160Moongi Sabat: 120Moongi Dhuli: 130(Prices are for retail in rupees per kg)"

If vegetables are costing so much now, it is going to be very tough next summer, she opined.A farmer, N. Venugopal Reddy, said the sudden spurt in prices was due to stoppage of vegetable supplies from Guntur and Krishna districts.Since the trucks transporting them have to pay road tax, they stopped coming to Telangana districts.The AP government is offering subsidy on transport tax and more farmers are supplying their produce  vegetables and flowers  to Bengaluru, he pointed out.According to him, four trucks used to come to Hyderabad carrying Okra everyday. Now they stopped.Naturally, the price of Okra goes up. That is what is happening to other produce as well, he said."

Commercial Taxes Minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav, however, justified the hike. ""Taxes have been increased only on high cost items used by citizens having good financial strength,"" he said.""Only by mobilising some additional resource from richer sections of the society, the state government can undertake welfare works for the poor,"" he added.JD(U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar echoed the views.

With sugarcane being integral to Pongal festivities, loads of cane has started to arrive to Long Bazaar from various parts of the State.Long Bazaar, which has always been a one-stop for all festival needs, is now buzzing with crowd shopping for the harvest festival.Cost of caneSale of sugarcane has started to pick up in Vellore. A bundle of sugarcane consisting of 18 to 20 canes cost Rs. 400 to 550 now. The cost depends on the canes height and thickness. Last year, a bundle was sold for Rs. 300 to Rs. 500, Aslam, a shopkeeper said.Vellore gets most of its sugarcane supply from Salem, Chidambaram and Kumbakonam, he said, adding, The yield was good this year but the rains in November damaged crops severely. Now, it seems that the government is procuring the damaged canes, and hence, farmers have been able to breathe easy. Vendors sell single sugarcane for Rs. 50 to Rs. 70.There cannot be sweet Pongal without jaggery. With jaggery being another key ingredient for the festival, the districts own-made jaggery is up for sale in Vellam Mandi. A kilo of jaggery costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 depending on colour.

The fuel and power fell 9.2% year-on-year in December reflecting the sharp decline in global crude oil prices. But the increase in food inflation stood out.In December food inflation rose an annual 8.2%, rising from November's 5.2% largely driven by a sharp spike in price of pulses which rose 55.6% year-on-year in last month. Prices of vegetables also firmed up rising an annual 20.6% during the month, while onion prices shot up an annual 26%. Potato prices fell nearly 35% year-on-year during December.Data released earlier this week showed retail prices inched for the fifth consecutive week in December to an annual 5.6% compared to the previous month's 5.4% increase. The government revised the reading for October to a decline of 3.7% compared to the previously reported number of a contraction of 3.8% Economists said the rise in food inflation was a worry and need to be watched. The RBI has also said that food prices need to be watched to assess the impact of patch monsoon rains on the farm sector. ""The considerably steeper increase in food inflation at the wholesale level than at the retail level in December 2015 poses some concern,"" said Aditi Nayar, economist at ratings agency ICRA.She said on a sequential basis, food prices displayed a disparate trend in December 2015, hardening at the wholesale level by 0.6% and softening at the retail level by 1.0%. Nayar said the month-on-month uptick in wholesale food prices in December 2015 may be a pre-cursor to a similar trend at the retail level in the ongoing month. ""With the contraction in industrial output in November 2015 largely attributable to a one-off base effect and the hardening of retail and wholesale inflation in December 2015, we continue to expect the RBI to pause until the fiscal targets for 2016-17 are revealed in the Union Budget,"" said Nayar."

There is one about a few farmers in a nearby village, who sold their land to a corporate and bought the chaar bangle waali car (referring to the Audi logo). Another one concerns a farmer near the Jamnagar district, who sold his land, bought a bike, and even hired a driver to take him around town.If you were willing to listen, farmers in Dholera will tell you more: of those who sold their land for a good price, refurbished their houses and bought shiny new Altos and Scorpios.So why wouldnt they do so too? Because if you lost your land, you would only end up as someones slave. Those who sold their land to the companies are now doing majoori (manual labour) on other peoples farms, or working in factories. The farmer who was once a malik (owner), is now taking a dabba (lunch box) and going to work every day, says Roop Sang Bhai of Sarasla village in Dholera.Labourers work on Togubha Dilubha Chudasma's land holding where they earn Rs 200 per day. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Money cannot be eaten, residents of Sarasla insist. The cars are standing stationary, the bike chauffeurs have turned unaffordable, and the promised jobs either didnt come, or didnt pay well, they lament. Villages nearby are full of those who have been ruined after selling their land to industries. The khet (fields) has always given us enough to eat. So why should we give it away? asks Roop Sang, echoing the sentiment of the group in the Sarasla cotton field.In the 22 villages of Dholera, the site for the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR), its a question that farmers want to pose to the authority in charge of acquiring land for this project.Like the rest of the country, in the town of Dholera too, land has become the flash point of conflict between its owners and the government. But what makes Dholera different  and a test case for alternative models of acquiring land for industry  is the state governments land pooling policy, as opposed to the contentious one on acquisition.Announced in 2007, the ambitious DSIR project was pitched as a global manufacturing and trading hub, with a smart city and an international airport to boot. It is the first industrial node  there are 24 planned along the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor  that was taken up for development. Touted to be PM Narendra Modis pet project (the CM of Gujarat when it was announced) the DSIR didnt see much activity until last year, when the project received a sanction of Rs 2,784 crore from the central government.Watch | Farmers explain the problem in DholeraThe funds, or the lack thereof, however, seem to be not the only hurdle that the project is up against. In December 2015, the state High Court ordered a status quo on land acquisition in the DSIR, in response to a petition by a group of farmers under the aegis of the NGO Gujarat Khedut Samaj (GKS) and a local organization, Bhal Bachao Samiti, who are contesting the governments land pooling policy on grounds that it limits the powers of the Panchayat.Its a conflict that DSIR Development Authority (DSIRDA) planners were only hoping to avoid. With the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act, 2013, turning into the proverbial political hot potato and the messy processes of acquisition leading to a face-off between the owners and the government (or, the corporate) in several projects across the country, the alternative of pooling held much promise, policy experts and planners argued.A Smart City hoarding in Dholera. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Land pooling -- at least on paper -- offers the new module of partnership between the owner and the developer. Here, the owner does not lose his property, as opposed to land acquisition, where the sale of land implies loss of all rights for the original owner.Typically, after acquisition, a change in land use (from agricultural to commercial) leads to a rise in the price of the land, often creating enough ground for discontent and resentment among the original owners. For instance, in places such as Gurgaon and Faridabad, where the state government acquired land and transferred it to private developers, theres widespread discontent among land owners who lament that while the developers made huge gains off the land, the farmers were left with a compensation that was incommensurate with the market price of the property anyway.In pooling, however, the premise is that the owners are willing partners who give up their land, and accrue the benefits of development. After the industries come in, roads, schools and hospitals are built up, the owner gets a portion of their land, the price of which has gone up now. The owner can either sell it, or build something of his own on it. Gujarat has always had a progressive policy of acquisition, where farmers get a share in the benefits of industrial development, says noted economist Yoginder K Alagh.So what went wrong in Dholera? The answer lies in the Gujarat SIR Act, 2009, under which the state government can take 50% of the farmers land without compensation, and return the other half at a different site after readjustment. The logic here is that after development of the site, the price of the farmers land would increase, and he would be a direct beneficiary of it. We are only taking barren land anyway, and also planning to give compensation for the 50% land that we are deducting, a senior official from the DSIRDA says.Bhagwanbhai has sold his land holdings and distributed the proceeds from the sale among his children. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)But farmers in Dholera are far from convinced. The best quality of wheat in the country, the Bhaliya, grows here; if it rains moderately, theres good cotton too. We also grow gram and cumin here. How can they say its barren? says Bhagwanbhai, 65, a resident of Sarasla village.The draft Environmental Impact Assessment report for the DSIR maintains the authoritys position on the fertility of the land in the region -- about 40% of land in Dholera is classified asagricultural fallow land, and only 7% is crop land, the report states.However, activists such as Sagar Rabari of GKS refute this claim: More than 60% of land in Dholera is fertile. Agricultural yield in the region amounts to 600-700 kg wheat per acre, and 400-500 per acre in cotton. Here, agriculture is still a profitable enterprise, he insists.Sagar Rabari of Khedut Samaj  Gujarat talks about farmer issues in Ahmedabad. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Farmers in the region second his opinion, and add that if the state government resolved the water scarcity issue, they could plan multiple crops on the same land and enhance their yield by two-fold. The fact that there has been a delay in making that a possibility the delay in the completion of the canal network that will deliver the waters of the Narmada to their fields  is also being perceived by the farmers as a ploy by the government to ensure that they would not hold on to their land.Resistance to the project is further complicated by the mess of land records in the region, an issue that plagues several regions in the country. Take the case of Faljibhai Nagjibhai Bauliya , 38, of Haibatpur village, who claims to have 96 acres of land, of which not even one half is finds mention in the computerised land records of the area.On a crisp cotton sheet spread on a wooden cot in his home in the village of Haibatpur, Faljibhai spreads out a stack of sepia-toned documents to substantiate his claim: land that his father received from the state in 1968 is still not in the computerised land records of the village.The talathi (village revenue secretary) wouldnt do it until we paid up, says Faljibhai.The mess of records can be traced to land reforms in the state, where landless families such as those of Faljibhais father received land under several schemes such as the Land Ceiling Act, the state tenancy law and the central governments Santhani scheme (where government wastelands were redistributed to the landless), explains GKS Sagar.However, he explains that the names of the new owners never made it to the records because of illiteracy, fragmentation of landholdings through the years and corrupt officials.Now, with the DSIRDA planning to take their land for the project, farmers such as Faljibhai are only left wondering how the planners would allot them their rightful share of land after deduction.Armed with information on the SIR Act by NGOs such as GKS, those such as Faljibhai argue that the policy doesnt seem to be working in their favour.For instance, Dholeras farmers argue that shifting to a new plot would imply fresh investments be made on farm infrastructure such as tubewells, and brings with it the question of viability of agriculture in a new place. Some villagers from nearby areas have told us that the new plots for us are being craved out of the saline area near the sea. We are not even educated enough to do much else; if agriculture fails, what are we going to do? asks Faljibhai.The fear of being given fallow and saline plots is predominant among the farmers of Dholera, who trace it to the emergence of real estate brokers in the area. These brokers deal in the sale and purchase of land, often a murky process involving the rich and powerful in the region, and beyond.Faljibhai shows documents of his land which are not acknowledged in the computer records of the authorities. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)It is in this trade and its underlying skewed power equations that farmers such as Faljibhai feel they might lose out. Playing in real estate is not for farmers like us; its for the dalaals (middlemen), he says.Land pooling as a scheme rests on the logic that owners can become entrepreneurs in their own right, but residents of Dholera point to the clause in the SIR Act stating that aside of the development charge that they would have to pay on the new plot, they would need permission from the authority to build something. The new plots that would be given to the farmers would be in specific zones such as IT, entertainment, recreation sports, and if the farmer wanted to build a structure that didnt fall in the zone of his new plot, he would need permission from the development authority.The official from the DSIRDA told HT that in light of the resistance to the project, the authority is willing to negotiate with the farmers and even pay compensation in the lieu of the land deducted to address their concerns: This project will increase job opportunities for the locals, and ensure that they benefit from the development of the region.But in the cotton fields of Sarasla, farmers say that for them, development implied better irrigation facilities for a robust yield.  We dont want the industries at the cost of our livelihood. We will resist this acquisition of our land. Jaan de denge par zameen nahi (we will give up our lives, but not the land), says Roop Sang, as the group standing in his cotton field nods in agreement.But Bhagwanbhai, who is landless now and depends on the trade in cattle feed procured from the fields, stops to correct them: Jaan bhi mat do, aur zameen bhi mat do (Dont give your lives, or your land), he tells them."
11,Popular weekly shandies need to be regulated,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/popular-weekly-shandies-need-to-be-regulated/article8127590.ece,2016-01-20,The Hindu,"Weekly shandies or vaara sandais are popular among the residents of the city and outskirts. Farmers from Alagarkoil, Alanganallur, Avaniapuram, Kadachanendal and other areas in the district sell their vegetables at locations which give easy access to people.Though regular visitors to these vaara sandais are familiar with the sellers (farmers), they are not sure about the correctness of weights and measures used. However, there is an impression among many buyers that prices are cheap in the weekly shandies than in regular markets and vegetable stalls.According to Corporation authorities, there are close to two dozen shandies functioning in the city and peripheries, but the major shandies popular among the consumers are Sunday market at Uchaparambumedu, Monday market at Koodal Nagar, Tuesday markert at Ellis Nagar, etc.On an average, 200 to 300 persons come to sell their produce, mainly vegetables and fruits. Local merchants also sell hot bajjis, potato chips and sugarcane juice at the shandies. A few artisans sell fancy handicraft items and so on. Close to 2,000 persons visit each shandy.For Roberts (55) of Ellis Nagar, the shandy has its own advantages and disadvantages. When roads were being laid at Ellis Nagar, the shandy was a big barrier for many residents as the farmers put up their shops on both sides of the roads. However, after the roads were laid and widened, vehicle movement had become easy and the number of farmers putting up shops at the shandy had also gone up, and the shandy had extended up to BSNL office from Tamil Nadu Housing Board office, he noted.Radhika, a BSNL employee from DSP Nagar, Bypass Road, said that vegetables like onion and carrot were fresh and reasonably priced at the shandy. It is convenient for me since I buy three or four vegetables once a week and store them in the refrigerator, she added.Another sideHowever, the residents of Rajaji Street in Uchaparambumedu near Iyer Bungalow had a different tale. On Sunday, the market would open at 5 p.m., which meant the farmers would arrive from 2 p.m. The noise and commotion deprived the residents of their post-lunch nap, said Rafiq, who runs a leather business in the city.Till about two years ago, the market functioned on the main road, but due to heavy vehicle movement, the farmers have sneaked into our street. The noise pollution is unbearable on Sundays, he said.Another senior citizen of the same street said that Madurai Corporation should not permit sale of eatables on roads. All vegetables were kept open. It was unhygienic since stray dogs and cattle wandered all around and urinated here and there. Since the market was open beyond 6 p.m., the quality of vegetables could not be checked.On Konnavayanchalai and Bypass Road, the residents alleged that traffic went for a toss when the markets opened. Already, travel on Bypass Road was risky as vehicle flow was high around 6 p.m. Traffic police at the intersection said that since the pathway was occupied by the farmers for their makeshift shandy, pedestrians had to use the roads. Every week, there were cases of freak accidents due to overcrowding and haphazard parking.An official of Corporation Health Department said that the respective sanitary inspectors and teams were entrusted with the task of clearing garbage from the weekly shandies the next day. For instance, a large posse of conservancy workers would be deployed to Uchaparambumedu area on Mondays to clear vegetable wastes which got piled up on both sides of the road, and it applied to other locations as well, she noted.Agriculture Department officials said that farmers from nearby areas such as Poikaikaraipatti, Kadachanendal, Oomachikulam and parts of Alanganallur brought their produce and sold them here. Prices were fixed by them and there was no mechanism with any agency to check their correctness. The prices would not be certainly lesser than uzhavar sandai rates.About a year ago, Labour Department officials, during a raid, found that the weights and measures used in these shandies were not calibrated or those approved by the government. A mere warning was given to the farmers to use electronic scale. The officials did not seize the weights since the farmers pleaded with them to forgive them, an official said.Police officers from the respective stations, who used to warn people through mobile public address system to beware of bag lifters and pickpockets till a few months back were not to be seen now, residents of Uchaparambumedu said.Many residents said that the corporation authorities should study the modalities to regulate the shandies and earmark exclusive space for the farmers. Instead of allowing the farmers to convert roads into makeshift shandies, the officials should provide protected places which would be safe and convenient for the residents, they said."

Last week, Bharatiya Janata Party minister Chandrakant Patil, who is public works department minister, had said that the APMC must ensure that farmers get proper price for their agricultural produce.Explaining the rationale behind putting up the proposal to the cabinet, industries minister Desai said: ""It is natural for the APMC or traders to oppose the move, but we thought of farmers and direct consumers. So, we will not back off,"" said Desai, expressing hope that the proposed draft is discussed and cleared within two or three weeks, so that it can be implemented.He also said that housing societies or residents can order vegetables or fruits directly from farmers as it be a mutually beneficial move. ""Consumers will get fresh farm produce while farmers will get a better price,"" said Desai.The Union government has proposed de-listing of fruits and vegetables, especially potato and onion, from the APMC regulation, which has been accepted by three statesMadhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.After meeting APMC traders, Patil said they will consider traders' side and APMC should not lose out. He raised doubt that direct selling would eliminate cheating of farmers."
13,Egg off mid-day meal menu,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/egg-off-midday-meal-menu/article8146950.ece,2016-01-24,The Hindu,"Thanks to the escalation of prices, the serving of nutritious egg in the mid-day meal scheme is becoming a distant dream in majority of the government schools in the district.Besides, with the steep increase of prices of pulses such as red gram and sky-rocketing prices of the vegetables due to the prevailing drought conditions, students of various government schools are unable to get the nutritious food promised by the State government under the scheme.Against the serving of egg twice in a week, the mid-day meal workers are now providing it only once in a week. On occasions, mid-day meal workers have stopped providing eggs and are serving only bananas as it not viable for them with the given commission.With the prices of red gram and green gram soaring high, workers are forced to serve dal prepared with Bengal gram, which is available at a cheaper price.Similarly, workers are unable to provide different varieties of vegetables due to escalation of prices, and they are forced to serve cheaply available vegetables such as cucumber, potatoes etc.How can we serve eggs twice in a week as per norms when the cost of each egg is Rs.4.50 paise to Rs. 5?, questions Lalitha, a mid-day meal worker in the Government High School, Mankammathota, in the town. The government just provides us rice free of cost. We have to purchase vegetables, oil, ingredients, firewood etc to prepare food at the cost of Rs. 6.64 paise per student, she says.The condition of mid-day meal workers serving food in primary schools is even worse.They are paid only Rs.4.76 paise per student."

15,"Tears, shock in Brazil city hit by Zika",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160131/jsp/foreign/story_66725.jsp,2016-01-31,Telegraph,"Maria Clara (left) and Camile Vitoria pose with their brother Matheus, who has microcephaly, in Recife. (Reuters) Recife (Brazil), Jan. 30: So many distraught mothers stream into the infant ward clutching babies with abnormally small heads that the receptionist sends them outside, to see if they can find a chair to wait under the mango tree. ""There's shade there, at least,"" said Maria Helena Lopes, 66, as she greeted one young mother after another. ""We'll call you when we're ready."" Roziline Ferreira took three buses to get here, grasping her 3-month-old son, Arthur, all the way. Tears swelled as she looked at him, recalling how the symptoms of the Zika virus had struck her during the second month of her pregnancy. How would she ever be able to care for him, she wondered? What kind of life would he have? ""It gets me angry when someone on the bus looks at Arthur and asks, 'What's wrong with his head?'"" Ferreira said. ""I tell them, 'Nothing's wrong, he's just different.' But then I think to myself, 'Yes, something's wrong. My son will never be like the other boys.'"" This poverty-stricken city near the Equator is at the centre of a nightmarish health crisis that has set off alarms across the Western Hemisphere. Mothers began showing up at the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital with their affected babies as early as September, stunning doctors and leaving even the most experienced among them scrambling to figure out what was going on. ""I would like to dream it isn't happening,"" said the head of the infant care unit, Dr Angela Rocha, who began working at the hospital in 1973. ""We've had our share of epidemics, but this is unprecedented."" Before last autumn, medical reports of babies born with brain damage and unusually small heads - a condition known as microcephaly - were so uncommon in Brazil that only about 150 cases were registered each year in the entire country. Now Brazilian officials are investigating thousands of them, and they contend that the mosquito-borne Zika virus is the cause. Virus specialists are racing to understand the connection, if any, between Zika and the rash of microcephaly cases in Brazil. But whatever the cause, ""There is no doubt that Brazil is experiencing a significant increase in microcephaly,"" said an official for Brazil's health ministry who was not authorised to speak publicly. ""We wouldn't have declared this situation a health emergency if this increase had not been detected."" The Zika epidemic has spread much faster than science's understanding of it. Researchers here believe that the virus made the leap from Polynesia to Brazil during the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament. Since then, as many as 1.5 million people in Brazil are believed to have been infected, and the virus has spread to more than 20 countries and territories in the Americas. The most common symptoms are relatively mild, like fever and joint pain, and most people with the virus feel no ill effects at all. But as Zika continued to spread across Brazil, particularly here in the northeast, doctors began to encounter a steady stream of women cradling babies with unusually small heads. ""I saw this dramatic increase in cases with my own eyes,"" said Dr Vanessa Van Der Linden, a neurologist in Recife who was among the first doctors to detect an increase in microcephaly cases last year. She said she was shocked when the babies began appearing at the public hospital where she works, the Hospital Baro de Lucena, and at her private practice. Altogether, she has examined about 60 cases in the last six months, she said - 10 times the rate of cases she came across in previous years. ""I never witnessed anything like it,"" Dr Van Der Linden said. She began suspecting a new cause for the microcephaly after testing the mothers for other possible factors, like toxoplasmosis, HIV and rubella. None of the tests showed that these ailments could have been responsible, prompting researchers to examine the link to Zika. ""This is an emergency because the situation is unprecedented,"" Dr Van Der Linden said. Dr Rocha, at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital, said that she and her team had also examined about 10 times as many babies with signs of microcephaly as they normally would, turning Recife into a harbinger of what officials fear could unfold on a much broader scale. Many of the mothers were already overwhelmed by poverty. Now they are grappling with an incurable condition that can involve seizures, impaired cognitive development, delayed motor functions, problems with speech and dwarfism. Two months ago, Selma Alves de Oliveira, 38, gave birth to a daughter, Maria das Graas. It was her eighth child, inevitably increasing the strain on her and her husband, who farm beans and potatoes on a small plot of land near Recife. But unlike her others, this child was born with microcephaly, requiring multiple bus rides or paying someone to drive them to Recife for medical care. New York Times News Service"

Mohinder Singh Sidhu's attempt to get out of the conventional crop cycle about two decades ago in Sheron village of Sangrur has been a fully spiced-up example of it.Sidhu started planting red chillies in his village known more for wheat and paddy rotation, season after season. Today, farmers from even Sirsa and Fatehabad districts of neighbouring Haryana come to Sheron to buy chilli seeds from Sidhu. For the forthcoming planting season, he has prepared seeds for 200 acres.Even near home, farmers of his village plan to have at least 50 acres under red chillie as planting starts in a week from now. Till a few years ago, chilli were planted over 10-15 acres. Sidhu's advice to his fellow farmers and higher prices fetched by his crop are the key reasons for the shift.Known as 'chilli king', 53-year-old Sidhu is, however, not limiting himself to one crop only. He also grows various vegetables and oil seeds, including tomatoes, grams, mustard and potatoes in half of his 30-acre landholding.His tryst with the spice crop began in 1995. A trendsetter, Sidhu are first in the area to set up net house at his farm to grow vegetables and chillies.Speaking about his foray into spices and vegetables, Sidhu said, ""A farmer has to spend nearly Rs 30,000 for sowing chilli in one acre and can get an average yield in the range 80-100 quintals. Going by today's price of about Rs 14-15 per kg, one can easily earn up to four times of the total input costs, which is roughly over Rs 1.2 lakh per acre. Having seen the high returns, more than a dozen farmers in my village alone have decided to grow chillies in the season which starts from the middle of February.""He says his motivation to diversify into other crops was simple. ""I wanted to increase my income from existing landholding. That's the reason I decided to grow chilli in 1995, and soon started reaping benefits of my new venture and carve a niche for myself in Punjab. Recognition followed sometime later as I was conferred with the state award for progressive farmer in 1998 from PAU. Next year, I received the Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal Award, and in 2000 PAU bestowed 'Chilli King' title on me. In 2005, I got the Chief Minister's Award."""

Last year, Nafed procured only 2,500 tonnes of summer onions under PCF due to lack of storage capacity. Now, it has increased the storage capacity to 4,000 metric tonnes and is planning to take storage facilities on lease for additional 4,000 metric tonnes.The summer crops, which have a shelf life of around six months, cater to market till the arrival of the fresh kharif crop by September-end. The kharif and late-kharif onions cater to market thereafter until arrival of the summer crop in March. The scarcity of onions is created if this cycle is affected.Hence, August to October is a crucial period every year when there are chances of onion scarcity and thereby prices reporting an upward trend. Considering this, the Centre has decided to use PSF to control onion prices. Storing of kharif onions is not possible as the kharif crop has a shelf life of only around 25 days. Hence, the farmers have no choice but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates.The Centre has made a provision of Rs 500 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is used to advance interest-free loans to central agencies like Nafed and SFAC to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees considering the possible scarcity of onions and price rise in future. Initially, the scheme is to be implemented for the current fiscal and the next financial year 2016-17 for onion, potato and pulses."

In the absence of purchasers for truckloads of these perishable commodities arriving at the citys mandis, there is now an abundance of stock in the Capital as compared to the usual demand.Traders at Azadpur mandi, Asias largest wholesale fruit and vegetable market, were earlier fearful that the ongoing protests by the Jat community would lead to low supply of items as major highways from Haryana were blocked. But the reverse of what was expected happened on Monday as large quantities of supplies that arrived at the mandi remained unsold.We had buyers only from Delhi and the UP side today. A major chunk of purchasers who come from the Haryana side, from areas like Sonipat, Panipat and Bhiwadi, have given the mandis a miss due to the ongoing protests, said Mahender Sanpal, president of the APMC.Traders from various cities falling within 100-200 kilometers of Delhi come to the Azadpur mandi for large-scale stocks. It is because of this that prices of fruits and vegetables are likely to fall in Delhi, while the rates may go up in Chandigarh, Rohtak, and other parts of Haryana. In Chandigarh, wholesale prices of potatoes have increased from Rs. 5 per kg to about Rs. 20, Mr. Sanpal explained. In Delhi, wholesale prices of garlic have fallen from Rs. 80 to Rs. 60. A truck of green chillies, which is usually sold for Rs. 5 lakh was sold for only Rs. 50,000. Most of the items have rotten, so they are being sold at throw away prices, added Mr Sanpal.Speaking about supplies to the mandis, APMC member Rajender Sharma said that only trucks coming directly from Haryana were hit. Only 5-10 per cent of the supplies have been affected as trucks from Haryana, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir were unable to enter Delhi, Mr. Sharma said. Several trucks managed to come to the Capital from that side despite the protests as transporters diverted the route to western UP. Another trader informed that around 500 trucks were stuck at various points including the Kundli border, Panipat and Sonipat.Several trucks managed to come to the Capitalas transporters diverted the route"
26,"From root to stem, it’s all on the platter",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/From-root-to-stem-its-all-on-the-platter/articleshow/51099676.cms,2016-02-23,The Times Of India,"Usually, when you cook a meal, there is a small pile of vegetable waste ready to be emptied into the bin, whether it is carrot peels or potato skins. But, with escalating food prices and a need to cut down on food waste, restaurants and individuals across the world are turning to 'root to stem' cooking, ensuring that no edible part of any vegetable goes waste. Carrot tops and onion peels, cauliflower stalks and watermelon rinds - all of it is used to dish out delicious chutneys, pickles and gravies.While the West may be discovering new ways to cut waste, Indians seem to be coming full circle. The older generation of Indians have always believed in the 'waste not, want not' maxim.""I have grown up being told not to waste food and even today I don't waste vegetables while cooking,"" says cookbook au- thor Sabita Radhakrishna. She uses the tender cauliflower stems to make a clear soup, and all vegetable peels and celery stems to whip up a broth. ""I collect vegetable peels and put them in a Ziploc, chop celery, add a bit of the fleshy outer skin of the onion, chop ginger-garlic and celery and slow-cook it,"" says Radhakrishna. The broth is then extracted and frozen in plastic containers and used instead of soup cubes.""With people earning more these days, I am not sure whether they are conscious of waste, unless it is inculcated in them,"" she adds.However, many families are indeed turning to old recipes. Swarnamalya Rajesh, an HR professional and mother of two, says tighter household budgets made her take a second look at her style of cooking. ""Earlier, I didn't think twice about throwing away the stems of coriander and keerai (greens). But now, I make chutney from the coriander stems and kootu from the keerai stems,"" she says, adding that she got the idea from her mother.Chitra Viswanathan  or ChitVish as she is known after her cooking app  says there is a growing awareness now. ""Traditionally, Indians have been frugal. For instance, the peel of the nendran banana was chopped, boiled with green gram soaked overnight and then tempered with various ingredients.""Every day, when she chops coriander, she drops the roots into the rasam when it is boiling, to add flavour. ""It can be strained before serving,"" says Viswanathan, who has come up with a aromatic 'herbal waste rasam'. Shree Periakaruppan, who runs Foodology, a recreational culinary studio, says she often encounters innovative dishes created from what was considered waste. Sorakka (bottle gourd), thol payasam, and chutney made of ridge gourd peel are some dishes she has come across. ""Even lemon zest, where you remove the outer layer of a citrus fruit, has become popular and is used in dishes like lemon cilantro rice,"" says Periakaruppan.Restaurants too are looking at traditional ways of cooking. ""With the cost of vegetables going up, it is becoming mandatory in restaurants that want to reduce edible waste,"" says Koushik, the Mad Chef of Eatitude, a consulting company for startup food ventures. So, onion and carrot peels are used to make vegetable stock, and watermelon rinds pickled or made into vadais. ""It helps maintain the prices at a restaurant,"" says Koushik."

While the number of Antyodaya beneficiaries in UP are 1.64 crore, Bundelkhand's own Antyodaya beneficiaries add up to 9.55 lakh. Distribution of the special Bundelkhand package will be overseen by the state's relief and rehabilitation department.On Tuesday, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav formally announced the extension of the National Food Security Act, 2013, to all 75 districts of the state.A formal announcement of special initiative for Bundelkhand, sources said, is expected to be announced by chief minister Akhilesh Yadav during the budget session of the Assembly.Conditions in Bundelkhand's seven districts -Jhansi, Lalitpur, Jalaun, Mahoba, Hamirpur, Banda, and Chitrakoot-are considerably worse.Apart from being among one of the poorest regions of the state, it has also fallen victim to three consecutive years of crop losses. Some farmer families have reportedly been forced, under the prevailing circumstances, to subsist on chapatis made of a locally grown grass called 'fikara'.While the modalities of the scheme are still in the process of being worked out, state government officials told TOI the desi ghee to be distributed in Bundelkhand will be sourced from UP's Pradeshik Cooperative Dairy Federation, Parag. Annually, Parag produces about 7 lakh kilos of desi ghee for consumption across the state. In Bundelkhand alone, the number of antyodaya beneficiaries is 9.55 lakh. It is not clear, as yet, where the extra quantities of desi ghee will be procured from.Following the government bounty, Bundelkhand will have more edible oil than the country's average consumption. India's per capita consumption of edible oil in 201314, according to an ICRA Limited report, was 14.4 kilo per annum. In Bundelkhand, under the government package, Antyodaya families will get 5 kilos of edible oil per month.Incidentally, UP has implemented the Act three years after its enactment. Announcing that the law will become fully operational across up by April 1, the chief minister said foodgrains under the targeted public distribution system (TPDS) would now be made available to all beneficiaries at subsidised rates of Rs 3, Rs 2, and Rs 1 per kilo of rice, wheat and coarse grains, respectively.Till now, only Antyodaya families -the poorest of poor in the state -were receiving subsidised foodgrains, while those families living below or above the poverty line were having to pay more for PDS food grain. While NFSA had already been implemented in 28 districts from January 1, this year, it has now become operational across UP, principal secretary (food and civil supplies) Sudhir Garg said on Tuesday.Bundelkhand, however, because of its ""exclusive criteria"", the government said, is not covered under the NFSA.Under the food security law, rice, wheat and coarse grains will be available to all categories of ration card holders BPL, Antyodaya and APL -at Rs 3, Rs 2 and Rs 1 per kilo, respectively. While NFSA ensures 5 kilos of food grains per month to beneficiaries, those registered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, the Act says, will continue to receive 35 kilos of food rains."

In its meeting on Tuesday, the state cabinet approved the formation of the fund, which will have a 50:50 participation of the state and Center.""The fund will have Rs 100 crore, pooled by both governments. Priority households and beneficiaries of Antodaya Anna Yojana will be brought under the fund. Food items such as pulses, potatoes and onions will be given at subsidized rates at the time of inflation,"" cabinet secretary Murari Lal Meena told reporters after the hour-long meeting held at Project Building. The fund will be put be put under a special committee which will be chaired by food and supplies secretary.The state cabinet gave its approval to a new state level watershed mission. Under the mission, the irrigation department will undertake 29 watershed projects across 15 districts. The fund for the project, cabinet spokesperson Meena said, will be pooled in rural infrastructure development fund (RIDF) of NABARD. A total of 95% of the total expected at Rs 330 crore will be borne by RIDF while the rest will be borne by the state. Under the 29 projects, 204 micro-watershed projects will be taken up in 15 districts including Ranchi, Garhwa, Deoghar, Dumka, Hazaribag, Dhanbad, Palamu and Khunti districts.The state IT department's proposal to set up integrated financial software for the state treasury was approved with a Ranchi based software company roped in for the project, which is pegged at Rs 9.32 crore.The state government approved the draft of a new bill which will promulgate a new set of rules and regulations of identification and preservation of ancient monuments and archeological sites. A proposal of setting up a new engineering college for women in Gola in Ramgarh was given approval. The facility, expected to come up by 2018-19 fiscal, will draw a net investment of Rs 125 in the first three years.In another decision, the daily allowance of home guards was raised to Rs 400. The home guards receive a daily allowance of Rs 300 at this moment."

How will the State now go ahead with its proposed projects are the moot questions.All successive governments in AP have failed the people. Post-bifurcation, our leaders should have insisted on equal sharing of Hyderabad revenue for next 10 years since it will remain the common capital till then. Telangana Chief Minister KCR has clearly made the best of the bifurcation, says B. Ramakrishnam Raju, national convenor of National Alliance of Peoples Movement.It is clear that the BJP doesnt trust Chandrababu Naidu. It is trying to marginalise TDP and strengthen its presence in this region. Naidu had also used BJP in the past when it was strong and dropped it like a hot potato when he did not need its support. It is now BJPs turn to pay him back in the same coin, he said.In the given circumstances, he said, the government should shun ambitious projects and instead take the realistic route.Polavaram projectFormer Government whip Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao in Viaskhapatnam called it a great injustice the allocation of a meagre Rs. 1,850 crore to the State against the need for Rs. 1 lakh crore. Pointing to the fact that the revised estimates of Polavaram project cost is around Rs. 36,000 crore, he said a pittance of Rs. 100 crore was grossly unfair.The allocation for Visakhapatnam Metro is a big joke, he said.He said Mr. Naidu should take the Opposition parties and other peoples associations into confidence and fight for the States right.Development in AP is not commensurate with the Centres expectations. Much hype is generated on the new capital but projects have not been implemented, said O. Srinivas, an advocate from Visakhapatnam. AP also should start making its own efforts, he opines.SlowdownIn Srikakulam, leaders have expressed worry over the possibility of unrest among unemployed youth due to slowdown in economic activity as a direct result of inadequate funds at disposal. Industrialist B. Govinda Rajulu is an optimist who argues that the budget will usher in long-term development in the backward Srikakulam since the thrust is on agriculture sector.Productive activitiesEconomic principles and other priorities are the guiding factors for preparing a budget. Uneconomic expenditure in AP like the Rs. 2,000 crore allotted to Krishna Pushkarams, may not be compensated by the Centre. The government has very few avenues to generate funds. It should encourage productive activities, says L.S.N. Prasad, a Professor of Economics in Hindu College, Guntur.Former MP Yelamanchili Sivaji has a piece of advice for Naidu: Mr. Naidu must realise that it is not possible for a government to build cities. Across the world, cities have been built over years by public and private participation. Unless the AP government comes up with a clear road map for Capital construction and the Polavaram project, the Centre is not going to help it.Bleak futureExpressing concern over a bleak future, he says industrial development may not get the fillip it needs. The leader does not see the possibility of cordial BJP-TDP ties in future.The TDP has no intellectual depth to respond to issues like reservation or the debate on intolerance, he says. Mr. Jaitleys budget has triggered fresh worries for Chartered Accountants.There would be no job for Chartered Accountants in general and small accountants in particular. The budget is neither investor-friendly nor encouraging for the IT sector, says Seshagiri Varaprasad, a CA from Rajamahendravaram.Balanced allocationWhile the Centre is right in making judicious and balanced allocation to all States, the BJP government should have considered APs case which is at the crossroads post-bifurcation, said D. Sundar Ram, academician and social activist from Tirupati.Price riseSk. Arif Ahmad, a private employee, said the budget does not address the problems of an average employee who is at the receiving end of price rise."

The idea is to provide essentials to Antyodaya and priority household families covered under the National Food Security Act.Recently, the price of arhar dal increased to around Rs 200 per kg, while that of onions shot up to Rs 80 per kg and potatoes up to Rs 30 per kg.The cabinet also approved Rs 104.37 crore for constructing a building for a proposed women's engineering college in the Gola area of Ramgarh district, a project it seeks to complete by 2018-19.

The price of potato rose from Rs 11 to Rs 16 over the last couple of days.In the harvest season, prices are going over the roof with the availability of new crops in the market. ""This has given away the clear failure of government policies and programmes announced to deal with crisis,"" said Benudhar Samal, a bank employee.Sources have revealed potato production has dropped by 20-30% across India this year, leading to a price rise in the major potato-producing state, West Bengal, from where Odisha imports a major portion of its needs. There has been a drop of over 40% in potato production in Odisha as well, sources said.The state produces about 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of potato from 15,000 hectares of farmland every year, against the requirement of 9.86 lakh metric tonnes per year.""We are keeping a close watch on the market and asked district collectors to take action against those who are charging higher rates from consumers.

Besides, special teams will conduct raids on potato godowns in the city to keep a check on hoarding. Retailers will also be directed to sell the vegetable at appropriate prices.The vegetable traders' association has ruled out the possibility of hoarding in Cuttack. There are hardly 8-10 big potato wholesalers in the city. ""It is difficult for traders to hoard potatoes as we do not have well-equipped cold storages to stock the vegetables. In fact, 5-7% of the vegetables rot during transportation. So we can't risk stocking it,"" said secretary of Chhatra Bazaar vegetable traders' association, Debendra Sahoo.Sahoo said attributed the price rise to low production in West Bengal. ""This year, West Bengal's potato production has gone down by almost 30-40%,"" added Sahoo. Traders in Cuttack import potato from West Bengal.

The bill is touted as a key reform measure in the vast real estate sector.The Bill, slated for passage in Rajya Sabha on Thursday, aims to protect property buyers interest from unscrupulous realtors and regulate the real estate sector.

Damodar said of the 18 cold storages under is department 12 are not working since 1998.""I had taken due steps at a high-level meeting for the revival of 10 cold storages and informed the registrar of cooperative societies in writing to start the process of seeking expression of interest through advertisements from private entrepreneurs, but in vain. Nothing has been done yet. What can I do?"" Damodar said.Pratap countered the minister's attempt to dissociate himself from the potato crisis. ""By throwing the blame on the bureaucrats the minister cannot shirk his responsibility. It is his job to make his department function sincerely and solve the problem,"" Pratap said.Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan after reaching Bhubaneswar on Saturday joined the potato row, much to the discomfiture of the BJD. ""It is unfortunate that after 15 years of being in power, the BJD government is not able to solve recurring potato shortage in the state. This government only knows how to claim credit over schemes announced by the Centre, but does nothing to address the problems faced by common people,"" Dharmendra said.Potato production in Odisha is officially stated to be around 2.5 lakh tonnes per annum, much less to meet the annual consumption of about 9 lakh tonnes. The low output is largely attributed to farmers' fear of distress sale of the crop due to non-availability of cold storage facilities. At present, potato price rules at Rs 20, almost double of last week's rate, hitting the general public severely.Leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra asked why the potato mission launched by the government last year failed to yield the desired results. The mission flopped because any scheme launched for acquiring political mileage is bound to fail, Narasingha said.Meanwhile, the BJP organised a demonstration at Sambalpur on Saturday protesting against the rising potato price."

This is utterly deplorable, he said.As the potato is sold at the rate of Rs. 18 a kg in market during the harvesting period, the three departments involved in the matter blame each other, he said.While State Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy claimed that potato production was not less as estimated, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Sanjay Dasburma said there has been 30 per cent less production of potato due to climate change.The BJP workers in Sambalpur burnt effigies of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and Agriculture Minister Maharathy over the States alleged inability to meet the potato requirement. - PTI"

It depends heavily on West Bengal to meet its requirement. When the scarcity was acute a few years ago, the State government had announced a potato mission for increasing production of tuber. However, the mission failed to yield desired results.According to the Ministers, the area of potato cultivation has been increased from 15,805 hectare to 25,270 hectare under the mission. Due to rise in temperature and fewer cold days, the potato cultivation was hit, the Ministers said.The Ministers, however, said potato scarcity was felt all over the country. While per kg price in Kolkata is Rs.14, it is Rs.20 in Chennai, Mumbai (Rs.19), New Delhi (Rs.14), Bhubaneswar (Rs.16) and Sambalpur (Rs.16), they said.In view of rising potato prices, the government on Monday declared to make enforcement activities stricter in order to ensure stability and take stringent action against hoarders.

A good yield was expected this year but heavy rains induced by westerly disturbances flattened the wheat crop less than a month before harvest in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The damage can be up to 50% in several districts of Haryana, Punjab, northern Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, an agriculture ministry official said, adding that state governments had been asked to submit reports.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered divisional commissioner A Anbarasu to assess the damage to crops in the Capital. Have asked Div Commissioner to assess damage to crops of farmers in Delhi due to unseasonal rains (sic), Kejriwal tweeted.The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan also instructed officials to assess the loss.In 2015, the Centre gave states about Rs 8,000 crore for crop losses due to unseasonal rains.In Madhya Pradesh, protesting farmers took a tractor trolley full of hailstones to the office of the SDM, Banda in Sagar district and a chakka jam protest was held on NH-86 near Banda on the Sagar-Chatarpur road to draw the administrations attention towards damage to crops.In Rohtak, Ram Chander, a Dalit farmer who had taken two acres of land on contract for Rs 25,000, said rain and thunderstorm had almost completely destroyed his wheat crop. There is not much left, he said, crying for government help.Farmer Kundan Lal Jatav of Ghatla village in Rajasthans Alwar district said with tears in his eyes that rain and hail ruined his entire mustard crop on seven bighas of land.The government needs about 62 million tonnes of grains, including wheat and rice, to ensure steady supply of food items under the national food security law. Good crops in 2014 had ensured adequate stocks but crop damage in two consecutive years can exert a burden on the buffer maintained by the Food Corporation of India.Experts say the government might not have enough buffer stocks to sell in the market to keep wheat prices under check.Apart from wheat, officials admit, there has been extensive damage to mustard, potato and peas in these states. The showers have withered the flowering of mangoes in Uttar Pradesh and apple, pears and apricots in Himachal Pradesh.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and asked the government to assess the crop damage and provide adequate compensation to the affected farmers.After the hailstorm and heavy rains, farmers of northern India are in distress. The government must act to give relief to farmers affected by crop damage, Gandhi said in the Lok Sabha.(With inputs from Jaipur, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Meerut)"

Potato price is high across the country. There is no point in buying potatoes at a high price from other states and selling at much higher price to consumers here. Therefore, we decided to stop the procurement process and manage with the existing stock,"" said cooperation minister Damodar Rout.Agriculture, food supplies and consumer welfare and agriculture departments called a joint meeting on Monday following criticism that lack of coordination between the departments and failure of potato mission led to the price rise in the state. Potato is selling at Rs 16 a kg in the retail market.Secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Sangha Sudhakar Panda said the government should come up with a proper plan to tackle this yearly crisis. ""The problem cannot be solved through trial and error. Around 10,000 metric tonnes (MT) of potatoes are available with traders and these will last three to four days,"" he said.The state produces 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh MT of potatoes as against the requirement of 11 lakh MT.

We will decide the next course of action after getting its report. We have sufficient stock and steps are being taken to check the price rise.

But surprisingly this time, veggie prices have fallen owing to increased production and arrivals in the markets.A kilogram of tomato is now priced at Rs 6 to Rs 8 in wholesale markets, while carrots, beans and brinjals cost about Rs 20-25. Capsicum and potatoes are priced at Rs 15 and Rs 20, respectively. Exactly a year ago, their prices during the same period had spiked, with tomato priced at Rs 20 and beans Rs 40 per kilo.Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Association president R V Gopi said carrots were priced at Rs 40 in March last year and the cost of other veggies too had increased by 10-20 per cent.This time, however, the prices have fallen, especially in the past week. Last week, one kilogram of tomato was priced at Rs 15, but now it is available at Rs 8 and even Rs 5 in the market.He said the main reason for the low prices was the increase in the arrival of vegetables.Last year, there was a decrease in the crop arrivals and hence the prices had gone up. For consumers, it is a good news this time, but for farmers it is a loss.G M Diwakar from SKR Market Traders Association said it was just the beginning of summer season and there were chances of veggie prices doubling in the next four months.Generally, the prices increase between April and July. Last year, there was no rainfall and hence the prices had increased. It takes three months for crop yield and this time, there has been sufficient rainfall. But when the actual summer sets in, then the prices may increase."

Presently, we have two godowns at Pimpalgaon and Lasalgaon with total 2,500 tonnes capacity. We have godowns at Lasalgaon with 1,500 tonnes storage capacity, while Pimpalgaon godown has capacity of 1,000 tonnes. Now, we have increased the onion storage capacity to 4,000 metric tonnes.""He added, ""The storage capacity of Laslagaon godown of NAFED has been increased from 1,500 metric tonnes to 2,500 metric tonnes, while the storage capacity of Pimpalgaon godown has been increased from 1,000 metric tonnes to 1,500 metric tonnes. This year, we are planning to create buffer stock of 10,000 metric tonnes of summer onions during April and May. We are planning to lease out storage facilities in district to store additional 6,000 metric tonnes of onions.""The summer crops with a shelf life of around six months, cater to market until arrival of the fresh kharif crop by September end. The kharif and late kharif onions cater to market thereafter until arrival of the summer crop in March. The scarcity of onions is created if this cycle is affected. Hence, August to October is a crucial period every year where there are chances of onion scarcity and thereby hike expected in the prices.Considering this fact, the central government has decided to use PSF to control onion prices. Storing of kharif onions is not possible as the kharif crop has a shelf life of around 25 days and they get rotten thereafter. Hence, the farmers have no choice but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates.The central government has made a provision of Rs 900 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is used to advance interest free loans to central agencies like NAFED and SFAC, to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) considering possibility of the scarcity of onions and rise in prices in future."

The Forest Department has proposed the elephant corridor project in Sakleshpur taluk to expand the elephant habitat as one of the steps to deal with the man-elephant conflict in the area.Frustrated by repeated incidents of elephants damaging crops and causing human deaths, the residents of villages in Sakleshpur taluk had stated, in writing, that they were ready to part with their land for the project. As many as 416 farmers had voluntarily come forward to part with around 2,361 acres of land. However, they demanded a good price for their property, from the government.The Hassan district administration conducted meetings with the villagers and recorded their opinions in 2015.The people were in favour of parting with their land, provided they got a good compensation package. The private land required for the project is located in Balehalla, Bettakumari, Jagata, Ettahalla, Boremane, Mankanahalli, Bisale and Arani villages. Except for a few, all the villagers had favoured the project.Recently Mr. A. Manju, minister in-charge of Hassan district, said that a team of officers from the Central government would also visit the place to study the proposed project.The farmers are expecting to get at least Rs. 15 to 20 lakh per acre of the land they will part with. Many of them have encroached upon government land and cultivated it. Now, they want compensation for the land they encroached upon. The officers have not given them any assurance on providing compensation for the land that they have encroached upon.In the budget, CM Siddaramaiah said that Rs. 20 crore will be set aside for the elephant corridor. Besides this, he also mooted encouraging non-governmental organisations and forest user agencies from purchasing private lands bordering forests, and suggested they hand over the same to the Forest Department.New cattle feed unitThe CM has proposed the establishment of a cattle feed unit in Arakalgudu. The Karnataka Milk Federation will make the investments for this unit. Arakalgudu is represented by Mr. Manju, minister for Animal Husbandry, in the Legislative Assembly.Subsidy on certified seedsHassan is one of the major potato producers of the state. The CM has announced a subsidy of up to 50 per cent or Rs. 10 per kg on certified seeds. This will benefit the potato growers, who are planning to purchase certified seeds for cultivation.

The government on February 13 last year decided to purchase the produce through Markfed (in seven districts) and Nafed (23 districts).While Markfed was to lift 8,500 MT, Nafed was assigned to procure 20,500 MT. Markfed opened procurement centres in six districts but closed them without purchase on the pretext that it did not find potato of specified size, the CAG said.The CAG report said the government then lowered the procurement target of Markfed to 5,500 MT in three districts (Bargarh, Balasore and Jharsuguda). However, due to delay in procurement and lack of cold storage facilities, panicked farmers were forced to sell potato outside the market yard."
47,‘Please have some mercy’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160326/jsp/odisha/story_76448.jsp,2016-03-26,Telegraph,"An internal rebellion has been cooking up in your party for the past two years. The difference of opinions among leaders, even ministers, have come to the fore. Co-operation minister Damodar Rout raised his voice against you on potato scarcity. What is happening? Our party is democratic. We may have some difference of opinion. Our outlook on a particular issue may be different. But, there is no question of dissension. When the leadership decides something, we all stand by it. Besides, Rout is a senior leader. If he advises something, we try to follow it. Sometimes, I give my views. But it should not be treated as serious difference of opinion. But, Rout has said that the potato crisis was caused by lack of co-ordination among various departments Ours is a potato-consuming state. We have 10 agro-climatic zones and each zone is identified with certain crops. We have not been able to produce the required amount of potato to meet our demands. Besides potato production has come down by 30 per cent in the neighbouring Bengal. With the launch of Potato Mission, we have come up with an integrated planning to meet the needs of tuber. This year, there will be a constant flow of potato to the market, but the price of potato will remain on the upper side. To overcome shortage of potato in the future, we are coming up with a number of cold storages. But will our dependence on Bengal continue? We have to depend on Bengal as it is a neighbouring state. Both on transport and economic grounds, it is advisable to bring in potato from Bengal. We have already told the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) to rethink the issue and see how more trucks of potato can come from other parts of the country. Besides, the Centre has brought potato and onion under the purview of essential commodities. So now, there will be barrier-free movement of these two products. People are not getting rice under public distribution system as there are lapses in the distribution of ration cards. Genuine beneficiaries are not getting ration and bungling of ration cards has been a major issue As we have taken up the exercise, many lapses may occur. But we are trying to make it error-free. Once digitisation of ration cards is complete, all these issues will be sorted out. If mistakes are noticed, we will rectify those. But to bring 3.5 crore people under Food Security Act is a huge task. The state is demanding more rice. Do you expect the Centre to oblige? The people prefer rice. If the Centre forces us to take wheat, what can we do? We have put pressure on the Centre to give us required rice and not wheat. The comptroller and auditor-general (CAG) has found out a number of lapses in the technical education imparted even in government-run colleges. How do you react to the charges? After placement of the report in the Assembly, I have asked for compliance of the report from the department, particularly on the loopholes. Once it is over, I will be able to give you a clear picture on this issue. Question marks have been raised on the quality of technical education We are taking a number of steps to reform the technical education sector. Earlier, our students had to appear the Odisha Joint Entrance Examination (OJEE) and all-India JEE. But we have now opted for JEE so that our students compete at the all-India level. We have got the desired results as well. But technical education at the national level faces a number of hurdles. Employment opportunities have come down in the core subjects. But, there is a demand in computer and software-related subjects and the situation is not alarming. You had started a special recruitment drive for the technically qualified people. But it has been stopped midway We had prepared a vision chart taking 10 factors into account. We have been able to achieve five targets, such as winding up of the diploma entrance test, opting for the JEE (Mains) and a few other things. But in the case of recruitment drive, we have not achieved success so far. When we were preparing to move ahead in this matter and hold discussions with 23 industrial houses, a lot of politics took place over the issue. We had an aim that the government would provide the platform. As it has not been possible so far, the deemed universities and the respective colleges are doing their own campus recruitment. However, I agree that unemployment is still a major problem. You are in the news as your opponents have alleged that you had taken undue favour from money collection company Artha Tatwa by accepting an SUV I expect the media to be just. I have taken loan from Vijaya Bank to buy the SUV. This can be checked from the bank and from the regional transport officer (RTO) as well. If anyone has any doubts, they can approach the CBI. But people think that you had taken favour from the deposit collection company Please have some mercy. If I had taken the vehicle as gift from the company and someone proves it, I will consume poison and not show my face to anyone. Have some sympathy for me. Why are you not examining the documents which were circulated by my political opponents? Please verify the authenticity of the documents from the advocate generals office or from the CBI. Nearly 4,000 people from your constituency had taken out a rally from Brahmagiri and demanded arrest of Congress leader Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra who had made these allegations The Congress had called a 12-hour Brahmagiri bandh on the issue. But the people of Brahmagiri have reposed their faith in me and they want to take the case to a logical end. Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra had used some harsh words against you... The people of Brahmagiri and Odisha will decide this issue. But I will wait and will take proper action at the proper time. I express my deep regrets if I have ever used any foul language against my opponent in the media. I dont want to stoop to such a level where people will equate me with Mohapatra. I had also lost election in Brahmagiri in the past, but had never done any vilification of anyone. After I won the election, I was expecting the same democratic values. But no due recognition was given to the democratic process. What can I say if somebody crosses the limits and behaves like a mad person? Did you raise the issue with your party president? I have already informed him about all these political developments, particularly how I had got the SUV by taking loans from the bank. There is no need to explain to him in details as he had already experienced a bit of the political heat during his tour to Brahmagiri. You have been the BJD youth wing president for nine years. You are also closely associated with the decision-making processes of the party. There is a perception that both the BJD and the BJP have a tacit understanding even though your party continues to oppose some of Centres decisions We are maintaining equal distance from both the BJP and the Congress. Being a regional party, we have our regional aspirations. Our prime and foremost duty is to see that we should get our due from Centre. The tax should be equally distributed among the states and there should not be any regional disparity. Our demand for special category state should be given due importance and other issues, such as Polavaram irrigation project, which will submerge vast swathe of area, be addressed. That means you will continue with your demand for a special category state status? Yes. We will do it to fulfil the aspirations of the people of this region. While you are saying you are opposing the BJP-led government at the Centre, your actions dont show it. All of you, including your partys 20 MPs, remained silent on the issue of shifting of wagon factory from Narla in Kalahandi district to Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh till it came to light through an RTI activist The chief minister had personally written to the Centre regarding the wagon factory. When it was made public, we had also raised the issue in the Assembly. We had made our stand clear in the Assembly and later it was supported by the Congress. So there is no need to be suspicious about the states motive. Though Naveen Patnaiks leadership remains undisputed, has he created a second rung of leaders within the party? The people of Odisha have reposed their faith in Naveen babu and with his inspiration everyone is trying to take Odisha forward to fulfil Biju Patnaiks dreams. The BJD does not need an alternative leadership at this moment."
48,World in a semolina puff,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160327/jsp/opinion/story_76555.jsp,2016-03-27,Telegraph,"Recently a friend landed in Calcutta, arriving in a high good mood. ""I have just been quaffing the best gol-gappas in Delhi! I tell you they're the best!"" Like any true Calcuttan, my phuchka-pride swelled up and cracked open. ""Nonsense! They can't be anywhere near as good as the ones my local guy sells down the road!"" A brief argument ensued, a verbal altercation that ended exactly as we both intended it to - we agreed to walk down the road to taste-test my local phuchkawallah's product. At the phuchka station we both took up our stances, my friend standing normally, holding her leaf-cup politely, like the well-brought-up Delhi-ite she is, and myself in a pose reminiscent of the great K. Srikkanth at the crease, legs far apart, body leaning forward, but as if the phuchkawallah was at silly point, and with my leaf-cup thrust out. Presently, the holed and armed sphericals began landing in our cups at speed. My friend soon adjusted her stance to avoid the phuchka water sloshing out of her cup and I began to laugh with the nastiness only found in Calcuttans exposing unsuspecting outsiders to Cal phuchkas for the first time. ""Why are they so thin?"" My friend complained, ""I can hardly get them into my mouth before they disintegrate! The stuffing keeps falling out!"" Between expertly crunched mouthfuls I explained to her that sitting at a table in Green Park or Bengali Market and gently eating the rhino-skinned, so-called gol-gappas did not a phuchka-gourmand make. ""This is the real thing. It's supposed to be thin. And you're supposed to eat it in... well, in a phuchka-quick moment!"" My visitor remained unconvinced and unimpressed: the things were not only too fragile - both the Delhi varieties, normal and suji, held their load better - but also too sour and jhaal, lacking the sweet balancing tang of imli ki chutney, and besides, the potatoes in Calcutta were cooked to an over-spiced mush whereas in Delhi the alu was simply boiled, but boiled perfectly. Later, I referred our quarrel to a fellow Gujarati friend, unlike me someone who wasn't born and brought up in phuchka-ville but in that other place on the other coast. ""What kind of Gujju are you?"" He sneered. ""What are all these gol-gappa and phuchka pretensions? It's paani- puri. It was born in Bombay. Invented by Gujjus. 'We are the authentic only' as they say here, and we have the best, original paani-puri, bas!"" Much as I hated to give any quarter to anything in Vadaa-pau-ville, and even as I was missing the suji puris served by a certain gol-gappa dispenser in Mukherjee Nagar in north Chhola-bhatura-pur, I remembered the echt-Gujarati paani-puri parties of my childhood and felt a twinge - the guy had a point, the balance between chilli, sour and sweet, the complexity and variety of the stuffing masalas, the texture of the puris themselves... aah. A few days after this, I found myself playing a return match in Delhi, eating gol-g's at Bengali Market, satisfying my suji-puri urge. It was then that I realized the truth: the best phuchka/gol-gappa/paani-puri is the one you are just about to insert into your cavernously open mouth. Unless of course you happen to be in one of those recent chains that have opened in London, their names woven with words such as 'spice' and 'masala' to connote some coolly hot South Asian chilliness, their gol-puri-phuchkas a travesty of the real things, made all the more painful by costing 7.50 + vat for four under-flavoured specimens. If London is a city overloaded with a choice of the different cuisines of the world, all of them over-priced, many of them Europified or Britishofied, then Calcutta is the opposite - the top grub here is what has been the best since at least half-a-century, if not longer. The traditional local street food is among the most interesting in the world; the different Bangla cuisines are amazing, though many subtleties and variations can still only be found in people's homes and not in restaurants; there is a decent smattering of stuff from other parts of India that has evolved here, such as Anglo-Indian, Calcutta-Awadhi, Punjabi/ Mughlai; and a smaller selection of more or less 'authentic' subcontinental food from the Northeast and south India and so on. International food of some quality is available, but only in the five-star fortresses. In comparison, being in Delhi and not London or Calcutta, has its advantages. Delhi has its own great cuisines, the Mughlai, the Bania vegetarian, the various street foods. Then it has the tributary cuisines from other Indian regions: from Chettinad, Kerala and Andhra to Kashmiri wazwan, from a great variety of northeastern food to Gujarati, Rajasthani and Konkani, and not excluding the centre of Chitto Park where you'll get some of the best Bangla khabar outside Bengal itself. But then, besides this already large variety, Delhi has something else, something which Calcutta desperately needs but is unlikely to get soon. Delhi has middle-priced (that is, considerably lower priced than five-star) restaurants that don't over-emphasize this business of 'authenticity'. For nearly 30 years Delhi has had an abundance of Italian, Thai, French and such places, so the whole obsession with claiming to be being 'real' and 'genuine' has lessened somewhat. What has replaced this in terms of excitement is a bunch of places where the menu displays a combination of skill and knowledge of international approaches to cooking with a stress on local produce, sometimes mixed with selectively picked international imports. So, yes, briefly touring the penumbra of the elite zone recently, I ate a pretty authentic Mexican dinner at a price that was less than rapacious - the dishes tasted 'authentic', the chillies were not local lal mirch but chipotle, ancho and cascabel, the mole was of proper bean, and so on. What preceded the food, though, were cocktails of tequila and tamarind which worked really well. Similarly, there was another dinner where the menu included words like 'medallions' and 'sous- vide', but ultimately one rediscovers one's basic roots in the most unexpected places. So, in an eatery attached to a museum, a place that's made a culinary reputation for itself, a place without a liquor licence, in a crowded, buzzing environment - what you might call 'lunch'. The menu, by the standard of today's Delhi prices, displays a very reasonable right hand column but that's not what catches one's eye or palate. The food here is inspired by traditional fare from all over the country, non-fancy, beautifully made, inventively taking off from the different regional traditions. There are mini rava idlis, there is a very nice take on sabudana bhajiyas, but most beautiful of all is a version of our very own Calcutta beetroot 'chop', a patty that's balled, breaded and lightly fried, accompanied by a ' masala cream cheese' dip. It reminds me of all the good and ghastly wedding catering I have encountered in Calcutta and it transcends all of it, but with easy humility, with no pomp or pretension. There is a whole tour of India in between, from Assamese black chicken in tingmo bread to paneer wittily sandwiched between white dhoklas, but at the end you again come face to face with Bengal: there are crpes involving coconut and notun gur, and then a bhapa doi cheesecake that is truly wonderful. To round off our culinary detour, there is also a dessert I didn't try, where western India clearly meets the northern part of the country, something called ""Mahabaleshwar Strawberry Golgappe - crispy semolina puffs stuffed with strawberry and cream"". This is not fancy food. If you look at the prices you would pay far more silly money in Calcutta, eating boring old Park Street restaurant fare. This is not food that depends on manchego cheese or miso sauce for effect - it has nothing to do with Spain or Japan. Where this and one or two other Delhi places have happily stolen from is the street food available all over the country, tweaking it, bending its ear, slapping and caressing it a little, to produce a very clean and original set of tastes. Which brings me back to my original point - the mother-in-law of tradition was also once the shy bride of innovation, authenticity- saas bhi kabhi originality-bahu thi."
49,Take tech help: CM to BJD workers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160328/jsp/odisha/story_76773.jsp,2016-03-28,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, March 27: The BJD and the BJP are gearing up for the panchayat polls due in Odisha early next year. BJP state executive committee members met in Puri to chalk out its future plans today, while the BJD held an orientation camp in Bhubaneswar asking its leaders to become tech-savvy and take advantage of social media platforms. ""Our leaders should make best possible use of social media,"" said chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik while addressing the party workshop here. Naveen asked the party leaders to reach out to the people with the message of achievements of his government. The state BJP unit, on the other hand, prepared a blueprint for the coming days at its state executive meeting today. This was the first meeting of the state executive after the reconstitution of the state team headed by Basant Kumar Panda. The state executive passed a political resolution expressing concern over the slow pace of development in the state, while it thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for paying special attention to the ""backward"" state. Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram and Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan attended the meeting. ""The 2016-17 state budget has presented a dismal economic scenario of the state. Out of the Rs 94,000 crore estimated budget proposals, the lion's share is central grants and tax devolution, which account for 48 per cent. On the other hand, the state's own revenue income has been estimated at Rs 45,104 crore. The state government has proposed to avail a loan of Rs 16,000 crore to meet the revenue shortfall,"" said the political resolution. Referring to the poor performance of the state in agriculture and allied sector, the state executive observed that the state was facing acute scarcity of potato as the state is able to produce 2 lakh metric tonnes against the demand of 10 lakh metric tonnes, which has triggered price rise of the tuber. The milk production in the state only accounts for 2 per cent of the country's production. Criticising the BJD government, the BJP executive said it had been able to rule the state for more than one and half a decade as the main opposition party Congress has failed in its constitutional responsibility. ""The party will expose the failures and misdeeds of the state government through a series of agitation programmes. It will also highlight the ""pro-development"" stand of the Modi government at the centre,"" said state BJP president Basant Kumar Panda."
50,UP's B'hand packagedefies SDRF norms,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/UPs-Bhand-packagedefies-SDRF-norms/articleshow/51591832.cms,2016-03-29,The Times Of India,"Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh government's largesse to the seven drought-hit districts of Bundelkhand contravenes the Centre's guidelines for use of emergency funds from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). UP government has announced that it will give 25kg potatoes, 10kg wheat flour, 5kg chana dal, 5 litres of edible oil, 1 litre desi ghee and 1kg milk powder to 2.34 lakh Antyodaya families in Bundelkhand. This will be in addition to the 35kg foodgrain the families receive under the National Food Security Act, 2013.According to SDRF guidelines cleared by the Centre on April 8, 2015, however, families grievously affected by natural calamities can be offered government assistance on following conditions: First at the rate of Rs 60 per adult, and Rs 45 per minor, for those families not staying in relief camps. Secondly, the state government should identify families not staying in relief camps and also declare the basis on which they were selected as beneficiaries for assistance. Thirdly, any special assistance can only be given to beneficiaries for 30 days, and extended in the case of drought to a maximum of 90 days or three months. Lastly, the state government cannot spend more than 25% of the total annual allocation to SDRF for extraordinary relief operations.But special assistance of the kind UP government plans to give to Bundelkhand's poorest of poor - the Antyodaya familes - is in direct contradiction of most of the SDRF guidelines. Sample this: Each relief package for distribution in the region costs the state more than Rs 2,500, including packaging, transport and distribution. According to UP's department of food and civil supplies, there are 2.34 lakh Antyodaya families in seven districts of Bundelkhand, with one family unit, on an average, accounting for two adults and three children. According to SDRF guidelines, relief should be given at the rate of Rs 60 per adult and Rs 45 per child. If this formula is followed, each family is entitled to receive relief worth Rs 255.But every unit of UP's Bundelkhand package-if only the cheapest variant of each component is considered-adds up to approximately Rs 1,670, minus the costs of packaging, transport and distribution. That's 10kg potatoes for about Rs 60-Rs 80, 5kg chana dal for Rs 375, 10kg wheat flour for Rs 240, 5 litres of mustard oil for Rs 575, and 1kg desi ghee for Rs 400. Add 1kg milk powder for families with children and the amount increases by Rs 250 to settle at Rs 1,920 per packet.For 2.34 lakh beneficiaries, the cost totals Rs 45 crore. With additional cost of packaging, transport and distribution, senior government functionaries confirm one month of supplying relief to Bundelkhand's poor will cost the state's exchequer approximately Rs 70 crore, and that is on the lesser side. UP does not have the financial resources to provide relief to the drought-hit farmers. Earlier this month, CM Akhilesh Yadav wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi asking for financial assistance from the Centre ""to provide, for at least six months' edible oil and foodgrains for residents of the drought-hit districts of the state."" In UP, SDRF allocation for a year is Rs 709 crore, not allowing the government to spend more than Rs 177 crore per annum for relief work across UP. for the moment, though, UP government will support poorest of poor in Bundelkhand for a month. Then, the drought-hit poor will be on their own, again."
51,RBI should go for low interest rates,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/537652/rbi-should-go-low-interest.html,2016-03-30,Deccan Herald,"Upendra Goel Mar 31, 2016, 0:01 ISTOnly growth has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and boost Make In India programme too.Growth can waitseems to be the favourite refrain of RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan. Before the previous NDA government demitted office in 2004, it had been successful in bringing down the interest rates to low levels. The economy and business sentiments were also booming at that time.Later on, inexplicably, interest rates were increased by more than a dozen times during UPA-II, particularly when D Subba Rao was the RBI governor. It is no secret that high interest rates cripple business, especially industry. The good returns on fixed deposits and other savings instruments also encourage the public to put money into savings instead of trying to recycle earnings for some productive work.This way, on one hand you are incentivising people by providing higher returns for keeping the surplus funds dormant, while on the other hand the costly finance provided by financial institutions dampens the spirits of business as well as entrepreneurship.Both the anomalies can be rectified by a simple remedy of reducing the interest rates. The automobiles, housing, realty and so many allied sectors will witness a kick start towards growth immediately. Not for nothing the Central Bank of Japan has introduced a negative interest regime on earnings  if you want to keep money in the savings, you will have to give bank some amount as charges as a punishment for not putting it to some productive use. The European Banks have been practicing it for at least 10-11 years now.Naturally, when the new government took over on the plank of development, the first thing the business expected it to do was to reduce interest rates as one of the initial steps to spur growth. As the demand for softening the interest rates grew louder, the dampener came from Rajan: First, we have to tackle inflation, growth can wait. Now it is the 15th consecutive month the WPI (whole sale price index) is negative and the prices of crude have touched rock bottom. All industrial products and items have been seeing negative inflation. Still no signs of interest rate reduction.Edible itemsThe only thing which remains costly is the edible items. God alone knows how does one tackle inflation of agricultural products by controlling interest rates. One may not buy a car or a house for higher interest rates, but would anybody stop buying potato or tomato even if the interest rates were 100%? Whatever small decrease in interest rates during last one year or so is too little.As the clamour for interest rate reduction continued to grow and the inflation logic did not hold good any more, Rajan came up with another one: The government has to tackle the fiscal deficit first, only then interest rates can be lowered, the growth can wait.Then just a few days ago, he said: If you ask me what is more important, growth or cleaning of banks balance sheets, I would say cleaning of banks balance sheets has to take priority. Grow-th can wait. And his latest masterstroke: We will not devalue our currency for increasing exports, the way China, Japan and Korea did. Growth can wait.Seems growth is the last thing on the RBI governors agenda or perhaps it is not there in his priority list at all. One is at a loss to understand that the government which came to power with such a huge mandate on the plank of development and for bringing acche din, seems to be not bothered about the growth at all. All the gains in the sectors of power, defence, railways, highways etc will be lost if they are not backed with solid reforms in financial sector.Sadly, there have been hardly any positive or thoughtful steps taken by finance ministry in last 21 months. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also has to appreciate that Make in India would not happen by mere rhetoric. The windfall gains because of increase in excise duty on petroleum products, coal block auctions and 3G spectrum auctions are keeping the government coffers full, making it complacent, whereas the dismal performance in direct and indirect tax collections should have rung alarm bells.When the IIP (Industrial Production Index) is shrinking, WPI is negative, sensex is falling, NPAs (non productive assets) are mounting and the banks bad loans are increasing to staggering proportions  no amount of treatment will help.Neither bringing of black laws like Bankruptcy Code 2015, will help. Rajan should have been the one piloting the engine of growth while he was proving to be the one permanently red-flagging the growth. His hawkish approach to the economy has proved to be disastrous. It is to be understood that it is only growth which has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and the momentum thus gained will give boost Make In India programme as well.The juggernaut of growth, which when unleashed, automatically pulls all the parameters of the economy to their desired slots. No stone should be left unturned including reduction in interest rates, to spur gr-owth. Because, development or growth cant wait. The aspirati-ons of a billion people also cant.(The writer is a technocrat and a small-scale entrepreneur based in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh)"
52,PepsiCo to help AP grow potatoes in Vizag,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/PepsiCo-to-help-AP-grow-potatoes-in-Vizag/articleshow/51641304.cms,2016-04-01,The Times Of India,"Visakhapatnam: After getting the desired results in the cultivation of Himachal Pradesh variety apples in Vizag Agency, the state government in association with MNC PepsiCo is planning to cultivate high quality potatoes in select mandals.PepsiCo, the New York-based multinational food, snack and beverage corporation, has signed an agreement with the department of horticulture, Andhra Pradesh, to provide necessary support to the farmers in cultivating potatoes and purchasing the produce as well.The horticulture department has received positive results from the seeds that were being tested in 20 acres at Araku and Dumbriguda Agency mandals from July 2015 on a trial basis. Now, the department and PepsiCo want to grow potatoes in nearly 1,000 acres from October 2016.Confirming this news to TOI, Visakhapatnam district horticulture assistant director G Prabhakara Rao said the FC3 variety is cultivated in Himachal Pradesh and specially meant for potato chips. PepsiCo is keen on using the potatoes for its chips units across the globe. ""Our department and PepsiCo conducted trials in Kuppam in Chittoor and Vizag Agency last season and the MNC representatives were satisfied with the results from Vizag Agency and have confirmed that they will go ahead with cultivation in 1,000 acres in the Agency area. The ITDA Paderu financially supported us in the trial run by sharing 50% of the input cost which is around Rs 30,000 per acre,"" Prabhakara Rao said. The department will procure around 1,000 tonnes of seeds from Himachal Pradesh.A PepsiCo representative said, ""Vizag Agency's weather is most favourable for the FC3 potatoes. We hope that we will get a good yield in Vizag. We will start the work from October this year.""Prabhakara Rao further said that they got nearly 4 to 5 tonnes of potatoes per acre in the trial session and they hope to generate 7 to 8 tonnes per acre during actual cultivation. ""Farmers will get good profits from the crop. A Rs 50000 investment will be required for an acre's crop and the returns are likely to be Rs 1 lakh. Priority will be given to local tribals to grow the potatoes. Only three agency mandals, namely, Araku, Dumbriguda and Hukumpeta are viable for the FC3 potatoes cultivation,"" the officer said.""These FC3 potatoes are not good for commercial purpose like local market. However, the potatoes which get rejected by PepsiCo will be given to commercial markets,"" Prabhakara Rao said.According to horticulture scientists, the FC3 potato is resistant to diseases, gives good yields than ordinary varieties, has thin skin, is easily washable and boiled and needs less fertiliser. All these qualities make it ideal for making chips.Horticulture officials said the MNC may set up a potato chips manufacturing unit in Vizag if they are satisfied with the potatoes cultivation here in the long run. The state government is also planning to give sops to various MNCs for their units in the state, the officer added."
53,"With mercury, veggie prices too going up",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/With-mercury-veggie-prices-too-going-up/articleshow/51674123.cms,2016-04-04,The Times Of India,"Nagpur: The summers are beginning to burn a hole in the consumers' pockets. With rising mercury, the cost of food basket is on the rise too. Due to dwindling supplies in the dry season, vegetable prices have gone up. Some items are costing double or close to it as compared to prices just a week ago.A week's vegetable supply for a family of 3 to 4 now comes for Rs300 to 350, which is more than the minimum wages fixed by the state government for an unskilled labourer at around Rs225 a day.Even as summer is making vegetables costlier, it comes at a time when rates of pulses, especially tur dal, have settled but only on the higher side. There are chances of a further increase in tur prices. Despite fresh supplies, not much respite is expected in the rates of wheat too, say sources in this business. The dry spell in the neighbouring Marathwada region is also having a slight impact on vegetable rates in the city, say a section of traders.Traders at markets like Gokulpeth and Fule market say this is the beginning, and another 20 to 25% increase in vegetable prices is expected in the days to come. A bout of unseasonal rains may make it worse, with rates further shooting up due to supplies being disrupted after that.The rates of almost all the vegetables have gone up by Rs10 a kg on an average over the last week, with Rs40/kg being the average price of any variety. However, there are certain vegetables like beans or lady fingers which have doubled. Brinjals of the smaller variety, which were in the range of Rs5 to 10 a kg are now Rs35 per kg, say traders.Sushil Shambarkar, a trader at Gokulpeth, said large part of the supplies come from other centres during summer since local sources dry up. Prices of beans have touched a high because of supply hitches at Chhindwara in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which is the major source. The rates will further go up in the coming weeks, he said.""Nagpur gets its supplies from Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Bhilai, Nashik and even Bangalore, apart from nearby villages. Some vegetables like pumpkin, coriander and cauliflower come from Nanded in Marathwada too. But supplies have entirely dried up this year due to the drought there,"" said Vijay Sonare at Gokulpeth.Nanded and other neighbouring districts contribute 10 to 15% of the total supply in Nagpur, which makes a considerable impact on the local rates, said Adul Sattar, a broker at Fule Market.On the foodgrains side, tur dal rates, which made headlines last year once again spiked by Rs10 a kg. This week tur dal was in the range of Rs132 to Rs115 with the bulk dealers. In neighbourhood stores, it is going at Rs140 to 130 a kg with some branded tur dal priced at Rs250 per kg too. ""The rates have gone up because farm produce markets were closed due to March ending. There is a possibility of some respite in the next week but rates may ultimately firm up, keeping tur dal rates at the same level,"" said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The tur production this year is less than last year, when tur dal was priced at Rs200 a kg, which means rates may further go up, say traders.Wheat prices are ranging from Rs2,500 to 4,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Fresh arrivals were low due to unseasonal rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh. As a result, new supply has not made much an impact in lowering the rates, said Motwani. Rice has been stable at Rs2,750 to 4,600 a quintal, he said.OUR TAKEAt present, not a single vegetable is available at affordable price. Usually in this season, price of potato and onion go down. But this year, we have no relief. The vegetables are becoming more and more out of reach of the common man. We fear that a further increase in the prices of petrol and diesel will affect the vegetable price hike moreAsha Mathur, 38, housewifeOver the past few months, we have witnessed at least 30-40% rise in vegetable prices. At a time when middle class families are already struggling with rocketing prices of cereals, the high vegetable prices are hitting the family budget hard. Lower middle class families are forced to compromise when it comes to providing nutritious diet to kids. The government needs to come up with a solution to provide relief from inflated prices of basic commoditiesManjari Joshi, 40, businesswomanWith summer approaching, prices of vegetables are only going to increase more. It is tougher for vegetarian families as green vegetables are the only source of nutrition for them. Veggies like capsicum, spinach and 'methi' which people usually prefer to eat in summer are also very costly. From cereals, potato, tomato, onion and green veggies  if everything is going to be costly, how does one expect a common man to survive?Purnima Singh, 44, teacherThe demand for fruits and vegetables is more in summer as people prefer drinking fresh juices. Such inflated prices are affecting people from all strata. This year particularly, the costs are too much on a higher side. To beat the price hike, I feel the best solution will be to eliminate selling of vegetables through middlemen. Sellers should directly buy vegetables from farmers. This will prove cost-friendly for customers as well as will be profitable for farmersResmi Umesh, 37, HeadmistressHousewives everywhere are struggling to balance their household budget due to the spiralling inflation. Even vegetables like French beans, capsicum, ladiesfinger, coriander are quite high. If vegetable price was low, it would have at least neutralized the out of reach prices of tur dal and other pulses.

They can register their names by paying Rs. 10 per kilo in advance. The State government has announced a subsidy of Rs. 10 per kilo for potato seeds.B. Suma, Deputy Director of the department, asked farmers to register their names at the earliest. Depending upon the number, the department would make arrangements to procure certified seeds, which will be distributed on first-come-first-serve basis.Hassan has been known for potato cultivation for the past several decades. However, in the last few years, potato growers suffered huge losses owing to late blight disease that reduced the yield substantially. Farmers were then dependent on potato growers in Punjab, who send them treated table potatoes for cultivation. In the last few years, farmers have been demanding certified seeds so that they can claim compensation.Last year, on an experimental basis, the department procured certified seeds for 60 farmers. Studies showed that the crop using certified seeds did not attract late blight disease. A subsidy was announced this year as the cost of certified seeds is higher than non-certified ones."

As compared to the price of Rs5-6 per kg in 2015, local farmers are currently fetching Rs10 per kg in the wholesale markets, thanks to lower production in other states.Top potato growing states -Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal -have seen production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. Although the yield in Gujarat, too, has dipped by 10% this year, unlike other major states Gujarat has registered an increase in potato production on account of higher acreage. In fact, the potato output has galloped substantially over the last two years.The potato production in an area of one lakh hectare was around 35 lakh tonnes as against 31 lakh tonnes of 2015 and 23 lakh tonnes in 2014.Agriculture minister, Babubhai Bokhiriya, said, ""There is low potato production in the country, barring Gujarat, and hence the farmers are getting good prices. The other reason being that the state has, in the last one year, increased its cold storage capacity, which has led to better storage facilities, and hence the farmers expecting a higher price later are storing their produce, rather than selling on spot,"" he said.""Last year, there was a glut in the market. The supply is higher this year, but the excess output has been absorbed by increase in storage capacity providing a much needed cushion to the farmers. The prices would have fallen this year, too, had there been a rise in potato production across the country,"" said Ashish Guru, president, Gujarat Cold Storage Association.The cold storage capacity in Gujarat saw addition of approximately 6.25 lakh tonnes (1.25 crore bags of 50 kg each). Currently, the capacity is 22.50 lakh tonnes, while the annual consumption of potato in the state is 20 lakh tonnes. The lower output in other states kept the prices of vegetable firm, and farmers in Gujarat are able to reap the benefits due to availability of cold storages. ""The wholesale prices had plummeted to Rs 5-6 per kg in Gujarat last year due to glut in the market. However, the prices have remained at Rs 10-13 per kg in 2016 much to the relief of farmers,"" Guru added.Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda. Gujarat potatoes are supplied to Maharashtra and states in south India, and are exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Mauritius."
57,ISRO helping govt keeping prices of potatoes and onions in check: SAC director,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/isro-helping-govt-keeping-prices-of-potatoes-and-onions-in-check-sac-director-2755414/,2016-04-15,Indian Express,"Space Applications Centre Director Tapan Misra. (Source: isro.gov.in) Space Applications Centre Director Tapan Misra. (Source: isro.gov.in)Stating that there is no paucity of innovation in India, Tapan Misra, the director of Space Applications Centre  an arm of ISRO  said that the countrys space agency has been helping the government in keeping the prices of agri-commodities in check through advanced predictions using satellite imagery.You would be seeing that the prices of potatoes or onions do not rise as much as they once used to. There was a time when their prices used to rise 500 percent and governments used to fall. The reason is that we do predictions based on satellite imaging and give production estimates to the government, said Misra while addressing an award ceremony of Gujarat Innovation Society (GIS) where Ela Bhatt, the founder of SEWA, Ahmedabad was awarded along with 14 other innovators.So if they know that the sugarcane production in UP and Maharashtra is going to be low, the government gets time to book sugar from Brazil. That is the reason why the prices of sugar have been between Rs 20-40 per kilogram during the last 10 years. The prices are lower than the inflation rates, he added.We (ISRO) has given the country so many communication satellites. Through the television programmes aired through these satellites we make the country laugh and also make them cry; fights in family happen and they stop as well. We do not give importance to this, but only when we do something like a Mars mission then ISROs contribution is acknowledged, Misra said while stressing on the innovations done by scientists at this institution.The senior ISRO scientist said that Indians do not respect the fact that a lot of innovations happen in the country with frugal finance. He narrated how SAC was planning to buy a special kind of CNC machine from Germany, but got the same made through a local company in Rajkot. If we had bought from Germany, it would have costed us Rs 12 crore, and we only paid Rs 1.5 crore to the local company. We ended up saving a lot of money, Misra said about a decision that was made a couple of months back.The chief guest of the event Dr C Muralikrishna Kumar from Niti Aayog said the NDA government under the Atal Innovation Mission will begin work on the establishing 500 tinkering labs in schools across the country in the next one month. We will set up a challenge where schools will compete to set up these laboratories that will boost the spirit of innovation among school children.Meanwhile, the GIS awards that were given out during the event included Ela Bhatt, founder of SEWA. She was given the Gujarat Ratna A life for innovation award. Diamond baron, Savji Dholakia, Managing Director of Hari Krishna Exports Pvt. Ltd., and Mr. Jaysukh O. Patel received the Hercules Award for conducting the highest and biggest loyalty program ever for employees in Surat and for a LED Motion Sensor Light for prevention of electricity wastage in Ahmedabad, respectively.The Achievers Award were bestowed upon Dr. Harish R Gershom for inventing HARISOPHONE, a musical instrument for augmenting the cure of human ailments through sound therapy in Ahmedabad , and Mr. Vijay Kothari who received it for conceptualizing the Waste Out of Wealth (WoW) Program meant for shredding secret records of companies and waste management and pollution prevention in Ahmedabad.The trendsetter awards were given to Nikisha Bhadreshbhai Jariwalas innovation that deals with an exquisite way to transliterate Gujarati text into Braille, a crucial aid for the visually impaired in Surat.

58,2 hr curfew break,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160420/jsp/jharkhand/story_81077.jsp,2016-04-20,Telegraph,"People hit the streets as curfew is relaxed in Hazaribagh on Tuesday afternoon. Picture by Vishvendu Jaipuriar Hazaribagh, April 19: Thousands milled on roads to buy basics like foodgrain, vegetables, milk and medicines as curfew was relaxed for two hours in Hazaribagh today, the first time since it was clamped at 8pm on Sunday following Ram Navami clashes earlier that day in the city at Lepo Road and two other places. Between 2pm and 4pm, huge crowds thronged the handful of shops or roadside kiosks. Prices were sky-high, with potatoes selling at Rs 40 a kilo and vegetables between Rs 50 and Rs 80 per kilo. ""We don't have any option but to pay whatever they want,"" said Vishnukant Sinha, an elderly resident buying essentials on Main Road. Shashank Singh of Shivdayal Nagar Mohalla, out to buy medicines for his elderly father, said he found only two medicine shops open, but he could not find what he needed. Nitesh Tiwary, a businessman and resident of New Area, said markets were forced to shut down on Thursday in view of the then upcoming Ram Navami festival, but the situation took a turn for the worse on Sunday with clashes, including inter-community ones, forcing the administration to impose curfew. ""Life was put on hold,"" Tiwary said. ""I had to keep my computer shop and internet caf closed. Because of a few trouble-makers, ordinary citizens like us suffer loss of peace and earnings and our children can't go to school."" Ahmad Zakaria, another businessman of Malviya Marg, echoed Tiwary. ""Why do people fight when living together peacefully helps everyone lead a good life?"" he said, returning home with food and basic provisions. Following Hazaribagh DC Mukesh Kumar's orders that people would have to obtain the SDO's permission for weddings, families of brides and grooms started meeting sadar subdivsional officer Anuj Kumar Prasad. At the SDO office, accountant Ranjan Sinha of Ashram Road in Kumhartoli, whose marriage has been fixed with a Ramgarh girl on April 22, was caught in a quandary. ""Yesterday was my tilak ceremony, but the bride's family could not reach from Ramgarh due to curfew. Now, I don't know whether to postpone my wedding,"" the groom-to-be said. ""Right from my band party to my tailor stitching my wedding clothes to the owners of the cars we had booked, all are Muslims. In this situation how can I expect services from them?"" Sinha asked, reminding everyone about Hazaribagh's intrinsic pluralistic society. Stating that the city was normal today, DC Kumar said he would review the situation tomorrow again. ""I personally walked the streets from Pelawal Mohalla to Jhanda Chowk. Everything was normal. We will take the next decision (on curfew relaxation) at 11am tomorrow."""
59,"In Grain Bowl, farmer distress is gnawing at Trinamul confidence",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160421/jsp/bengal/story_81331.jsp,2016-04-21,Telegraph,"Burdwan, April 20: Madhumita Ghosh, a widow in her early thirties, has taken a vow. The daughter of a farmer, who was married to a farmer's family, would not let her two sons - Kuntal and Soumyodeep - to till land. Sitting in her in-laws' home at Hitta village in Burdwan's Galsi, Madhumita, whose husband Sushanto committed suicide in January 2012, unequivocally declares: ""They will never be farmers."" Her father-in-law Bikash Chandra Ghosh nods in agreement as the two boys, who study in Classes VI and VIII, stand next to her wearing blank looks. Life is full of uncertainties for the Ghoshes as they do not know how to pay back the banks Rs 3 lakh. The future of the two boys is uncertain as their mother does not have the resources to fund their education. Sushanto's parents don't have money to buy medicines. The family members of Sushanto Ghosh, who committed suicide. Picture by Partha Protim Koner The exact reason behind Sushanto's suicide is not known as the family's version that he killed himself to escape indebtedness has no takers in the administration and hence, no government support. ""What do I say? We lost everything because we are farmers,"" she says. Her torn green sari bears signs of penury. Some neighbours listen to her conversation with this correspondent with rapt attention on a sultry afternoon of April, the harvesting time for the boro crop. Asked why they aren't in the fields, most of them say they haven't sown the seeds. ""Why should we? Farming means losses,"" replies Panchu Gopal Ghosh, who has been farming for at least four decades. The veteran offers a rough calculation to explain the lack of incentive in farming. Such answers from members of farmer families in Galsi block - the top rice producer for years in Bengal and regarded as the Granary of Burdwan, which itself is the state's granary - may surprise outsiders but not the people of the district, where 70 per cent of the population has something or the other to do with agriculture. ""There is no point talking about what it was before and how happy and prosperous we farmers were.... Today, it is even better to be a manual labourer,"" says Swapan Ghosh, who has given up farming and become a mason. This approach of farmers - seen and heard in the rice belt of the district, including Galsi, Bhatar, Raina and Khandaghosh, and the potato belt covering Memari, Manteswar and Jamalpur - has become a worry for the ruling Trinamul ahead of tomorrow's elections, when 16 Assembly constituencies of rural Burdwan will go to the polls. If slogans in Burdwan are any indication, the writing on the wall captures the mood. Sample this: "" Kake vote dilam kaka? Mill- e dhan, bank-e taka, chashir haat sudhui fanka (Whom did we vote, dear friend? Mills are stocked with paddy, banks stashed with money, but the farmers' hands are empty)."" In the 2011 Assembly polls, Trinamul had won nine of the 16 seats. Mamata Banerjee's Maa-Mati-Manush slogan had worked wonders in the district as Trinamul swept the panchayat polls of 2013. There were, however, complaints of electoral malpractice. The trend continued in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls with Trinamul candidates leading in 13 of these constituencies. Aroop Biswas, the Trinamul observer for the district, says the summer of 2016 will not be an aberration either but several lower-level party functionaries feel otherwise. ""The CPM is building its campaign on the agrarian distress and it's striking a chord with common people.... Our target of sweeping the district will not be met,"" a Trinamul leader in Burdwan said. According to him, the CPM's campaign, highlighting a list carrying names, addresses and other details of over 140 farmers who committed suicide in the past few years, has caught on in the region. Trinamul sources concede the chief minister is aware of the discontent brewing in rural Burdwan and she tried to tackle it by holding Mati Utsav in the district, where some farmers were given cash awards and certificates for excellence in production. ""But that hasn't helped much,"" admits the source, adding that the list of problems has only grown for farmers. One of the recurring complaints heard across rural Burdwan is the Mamata government's failure to ensure remunerative price for farm produce while the cost of agriculture has galloped because of a rise in fertiliser prices and a subsequent increase in electricity tariff. ""A 60kg sack of rice used to yield anything between Rs 850 and Rs 900 till 2011. But now the farmers are getting between Rs 620 and Rs 650 per sack. There is genuine discontent,"" says Arup Kumar Chattopadhyay, a professor of economics at Burdwan University. Although on paper the farmers are getting Rs 814 a sack because that's the minimum support price for paddy, price realisation is much less, several farmers have said. ""Now that the panchayats play a role in procurement, they deduct charges like cost of collection of paddy from farmers' homes and various other handling expenses.... Such deductions weren't made during Left rule,"" says Abdur Rezzak Mondal, the district secretary of the CPM's peasant wing. The state government's plan to ensure payment through cheques has boomeranged as most farmers are complaining of delay in payment, which adds to their interest burden on the capital they borrow from money lenders. Scarcity of water is the other problem. The ripples of the discontent in rural Burdwan can be felt in Burdwan town as well. Traders complain of poor sales in the past few years because of the agrarian distress. ""Burdwan doesn't have any industry.... The surplus from agriculture sustains trade here but the flow of money has stopped and all the traders are suffering,"" said Sumit Dutta, the convenor of a traders' body in Burdwan. Agrarian distress and its negative impact on the economy are not unique to Burdwan or any other district in Bengal as a host of factors - some beyond the control of the state government - have made agriculture unviable. But the CPM has made it a poll issue in Burdwan and the hope for the party's revival is riding on the farmers' discontent. The focus on farmers' issues has already helped the CPM as its leaders have managed to build up resistance against Trinamul in the run-up to the polls by campaigning in areas like Raina and Khandaghosh and even finalising the list of polling agents to be stationed in the booths tomorrow. In contemporary Bengal, the finalisation of the list in itself is an achievement. ""We have made a turnaround because we have exposed how the ruling party has ruined agriculture in Burdwan.... Tomorrow is the final and we are ready to resist Trinamul goons if they try to loot votes,"" said CPM state committee member Amal Halder. The similarity with the summer of 2011 cannot be missed. Mamata had then played the farmers' card to her advantage. Amid questions whether the CPM can reap similar benefits, it is almost certain that Trinamul will fare worse than in 2014 in rural Bengal and it will be a blow to Mamata in central Bengal.

The vegetable that made headlines last year when its price touched Rs70 a kg is today selling for just Rs5 a kg in the bulk market. In neighbourhood vegetable markets, the rates are ranging from Rs14 to 16 a kg, less than half the price last April.Hoping to get higher prices like last year, farmers had increased the area under onion cultivation. This has led to a deluge of supply, bringing the prices down. The production has gone up in all onion growing states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka. White onions are being sold at Rs5 to 6 in the wholesale market and it is Rs7 to 8 for the red variety, said a source in M/s Afzal Trading Company, a firm based at Kalamna agriculture produce market yard. In a month, the rates have gone down by Rs2 per kg, he said.The current rates are not even enough to meet the production cost for farmers, who need to get at least Rs6 to 7 a kg to break even, sources said.Vijay Rathore, a cultivator from Dhule district, said now farmers have begun holding on to the stock. ""Even I have stored around 200 quintals in a chali (bamboo enclosure used to store onions). I will wait for the rates to go up,"" he said The cost of each chali comes to around Rs25,000, he said.There is a glut in Karnataka too, which is the second major source of supply for traders in Nagpur. B Ravishankar of M/s Ravi Trading Company said the southern crop, which starts in July-August is exhausted by January in the normal course. However, the arrivals are continuing even in April and are expected to last for one more month. This shows that the prices will remain subdued in the near future. In Bangalore, the bulk rates have touched Rs5 a kg, he said.Potatoes, which are traded along with onions, are however getting slightly costlier. The rates opened at Rs600 per 50kg at the start of the season at Mainpuri in UP, a major supply centre. As against this, it was Rs400 last year when the production was relatively low.A trader at M/s Aditya Kumar and Co in Mainpuri said this is because this year the potato growers are holding on to the crop and allowing only limited supplies into the market. So, despite higher output the rates have remained firm.A trader at Ram Aloo Bhandar at Gokulpeth market said potatoes are costing Rs20 a kg and the rates are inching up gradually. At this time of the year, when fresh supply is available, the rates are usually in the range Rs12 to 14 a kg. However, this year the commodity is in shortage at the bulk market, he said."
61,Why agri startups are blossoming,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Why-agri-startups-are-blossoming/articleshow/51962194.cms,2016-04-24,The Times Of India,"When Ranjith Mukundan quit his job at Wipro in 2011 after 15 years, farming wasn't on his mind. Bengaluru-born Mukundan and his four co-founders were exploring the Internet of Things space, the idea of connecting ordinary objects to send and receive data. They considered telemedicine, but decided against it since many MNCs were in the business.That's when one of the founders pointed to the problems in dairy management, inclcuding that milk stored in regular containers become non-consumable after a few hours. His uncle was an organic dairy farmer in Tiptur, a town 150km north west of Bengaluru, and had trouble managing his cattle and the supply chain. They liked the idea so Mukundan, now 41, and the team spent the next eight months at the dairy farm and also visited farms in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha. Their company, Stellapps, used their learnings to develop automated dairy solutions, and now works with milk cooperative societies such as Aavin, Milma and Tirumala. Its products are in 250 farms and are used by three lakh dairy farmers.Agriculture in India is a $370 billion sector, but there is little application of technology to improve productivity and lift millions out of poverty . Now, a clutch of entrepreneurs is looking out of their city offices to the countryside to change this.Bengaluru-based Flybird Agri Innovations places sensors in the soil to detect moisture content and control irrigation. It's installed sensors in 45 villages in Karnataka to help farmers in the drought-hit state optimize irrigation. The company is supported by Chennai-based Villgro, a social impact fund backed by Dell Foundation.Most companies faced resistance when they first set up their equipment. ""Our work exposed the malpractices of middlemen,"" says Mukundan, who is now recruiting sales people in Delhi and Gujarat.The company is looking to expand to allied sectors such as fisheries where perishabil ity is high. Despite the need for technological intervention, there's not much funding coming to startups in this sector.Funding for Indian agriculture startups declined to $56 million in 2015 from $123 million the year before, according to data from Tracxn, a startup activity tracking platform. In 2015, also a drought year, just 20 agriculture-related startups raised money , but $6 billion was invested overall in tech startups that year. Agriculture startups attracted less than 1% of the total.""The agri funds in the country are mostly early stage investors, and the startups struggle to raise subsequent rounds of funding, thus prolonging their scale up,"" says Hemendra Mathur, an investor in agri businesses and former managing director of SEAF India Investment Advisory .While overall inflation has been under control, food inflation is growing at 7%, indicating a mismatch of supply and demand. India imported corn after 16 years, and it has turned from an exporter to an importer of soya. ""The inflation translates into an additional `70,000 crore opportunity.The propensity for consumption is also going up. Droughts are an opportunity to develop various seeds and processes that help reduce water consumption without affecting productivity ,"" says Mathur.Investors tend to view agriculture as a risky proposition. ""Most investors don't understand agriculture. The strong gov ernment intervention in the sector along with the vagaries of nature accentuate the business risks associated with startups in the space,"" says Srikrishna Ramamoorthy , partner at Unitus Seed Fund, an India-focussed fund supported by Gates Foundation that invests in social impact enterprises. It has invested in agri startup Villfarm and is looking for more opportunities. Ramamoorthy says most small farmers are not willing to try technology , and even the large farmers find the equipment too expensive.""Very often, it is not whether the technology is available. The problem is whether there are India-specific solutions,"" says Mark Kahn, founding partner of Omnivore Partners, an agriculture technology focused fund. It is backed by diversified agri-business firm Godrej Agrovet, SIDBI and SBI among other financial institutions. It has invested in Stellapps and Ecozen, a micro cold storage facility that works on solar power and can be installed even in small farms.In a country where more than half of the population still survives on agriculture, fruit and vegetables worth $2 billion are wasted because of lack of supply chain management and cold storage facilities.""The big cold storage products of the west are not affordable for many Indians,"" says Kahn. He has investments in 11 agriculture startups, including Skymet, which analyses weather patterns and predicts risk in agriculture for every season.Kahn was earlier head of business strategy and mergers and acquisitions at Godrej Agrovet and found that most agritechnology startups struggle to raise funding. He convinced Godrej to anchor a fund to support more firms and thus Omnivores was founded in 2011 with a corpus of Rs 260 crore.The same year also saw the establishment of the SONG Fund by Thomas Hyland, a US citizen who came to India and travelled around the country in trains for a year. He then went on to do a management degree from ISB, Hyderabad, and established Song, backed by US billionaire George Soros, Omidyar Network and Google Capital. ""For a country of India's size, there are not enough startups that focus on technologies that addresses the lower middle class and bottom-of-pyramid solutions,"" says Hyland, who has since started a second fund Aspada.These funds work with the startups for several months before committing to investments. Hyland, for instance, worked with Pune-based SV Agri for eight months before investing. SV works with potato farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat to improve productivity by providing better seeds, as well as working on supply chain and processing.It supplies potatoes to ITC, Marico and Pepsico for chips. ""Not many big companies or startups want to do backward integration when it comes to agriculture because they don't want to get their hands dirty ,"" says Hemant Gaur, founder of SV Agri.Rohtash Mal, a former CEO of tractor firm Escorts, has established EM3, which provides farm machinery vehicles on demand. ""Only 10% of the country's farmers can afford farm machinery and ours is a pay-per-use model. We wanted to reach 90% of the farmers,"" says Mal, who has 15 centres in MP , Bihar and eastern UP . The price is based on the farmhold area measured using satellites. Each centre sends machinery to a 20km radius and Mal says 95% of his customers come back.""Government policies treat agriculture as a poverty alleviation method rather than a means to enhance productivity and raise incomes, and this keeps entrepreneurs out,"" says Mal.Mathur says that funds like Omnivore, Villgro and Aspada give him hope, and entrepreneurs are trying to start agri businesses. ""The slowdown in e-commerce and the entrepreneurial energy will spur a new wave in rural and agricultural innovation,"" he says."
62,Potato pocket pinch,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160427/jsp/jharkhand/story_82390.jsp,2016-04-27,Telegraph,"A vendor sells potatoes and onions at Kokar Bazar in Ranchi last week. Picture by Prashant Mitra Onion prices may have fallen drastically in Ranchi, but potato is now acting pricey. The staple, which used to cost around Rs 10-12 a kilo till a fortnight ago, is now available between Rs 16 and Rs 20. Wholesale traders said potato prices were high this year due to poor production in different parts of the country and they might escalate further. ""We are selling potatoes to local traders in the range between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,600 per quintal because of poor production of potatoes this year in states such as Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. There is the threat of another spurt in prices,"" S. Lal, a trader in Chaibasa, told The Telegraph. Kesto Mahto, who sells potato, onion, garlic at the local Kokar market near Distillery Bridge, said: ""What can we do when we get the potatoes at higher rates from the wholesale markets? In the summers, potatoes also start rotting soon."" Not surprisingly, Ranchi residents are dismayed with the prices of the essential commodity. ""If the rate goes beyond Rs 20 per kg, we will reduce potato consumption. After all, potatoes are not healthy for diabetic and obese people,"" said Anita Jain, a resident on Lake Road area. No step to check the prices has yet been taken by the Jharkhand Agriculture Marketing Board, as no directives have been issued to the wholesale traders so far regarding price control or stock maintenance. Asked, managing director of the board Rajkumar said he had returned from Bengal recently and needed to find out whether any circular had been issued. This summer is also spelling bad news for vegetable budgets. As the mercury soars, vegetable production falls while marriage season keeps demand on the higher side. Most veggies such as cauliflower, cabbage, pointed gourd (parwal), bottle gourd (lauki) sell for around Rs 20-Rs 30 per kg. Capsicum and coriander leaves cost a whopping Rs 60 per kg. ""These prices won't fall before July,"" said a vegetable dealer."
63,Potato factory flop cloud on polls,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160430/jsp/bengal/story_83096.jsp,2016-04-30,Telegraph,"Calcutta, April 29: The Bengal government has recently abandoned its proposed potato wafer processing unit in Hooghly's Sheoraphuli after no private company showed interest in the project, leaving the ruling party in a soup ahead of elections. ""The fate of the proposed unit was never bright but the final decision was taken a few months ago.... The project could have helped us in the elections if it had taken a proper shape, but we could not do it because of lack of proper planning,"" a minister told The Telegraph. Eighteen Assembly segments in Hooghly will vote on April 30. According to sources at Nabanna, the government had floated an expression of interest inviting private partners to set up the unit under a public-private partnership in 2013. As none of the established private companies came forward, the project was abandoned at the end of 2015. Government sources said no private investor showed interest in developing the processing unit for two reasons - lack of a suitable variety of potato and ban on contract farming in the state. The potato processing units prefer the Chipsona potato to make wafers but in Bengal, priority is given to the table variety potatoes such as Jyoti and Pukhraj. ""The processing unit would have overcome the problem had there been a scope for contract farming.... But in Bengal, we did not want contract farming and that's why no major processing unit would invest here,"" said a senior government official. The project had initially drawn attention as the unit could have helped around 8 lakh potato farmers of Hooghly. The Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority had released a sum of Rs 8 crore to start the ground work. Senior government officials said the project had the potential to give mileage to the ruling party in Hooghly for two reasons. First, the state government was trying to focus on agro-based industries in the absence of big-ticket investments in the five years of the Mamata Banerjee-led government. If this unit had come up, it would have been seen as a success for the government. Second, it could have helped lakhs of potato farmers in the district who often face trouble in the years when there is surplus production of the tuber. ""In a district where the Tata Nano small-car factory in Singur was abandoned because of Trinamul resistance, the potato wafer processing unit could have been a game-changer for the ruling party,"" said a senior government official. Although, Trinamul had bagged 16 out of 18 Assembly seats in the district in 2011, insiders said the party was facing questions ahead of this year's elections. ""We cannot reply properly when we face questions on why the fate of potato farmers has not changed in the past five years... This unit was important for us to answer this question,"" said a Trinamul leader. Hooghly produces about 25 per cent of the state's average 100 lakh tonnes of potato every year, sources said. The question of the well-being of farmers in Hooghly is important for the ruling party this year as it wants to win all the seats in the district. ""According to reports that we are getting from other districts where elections have already been held, it is clear that we need to win the maximum number of seats in the last two phases on April 30 and May 5 to retain power.... Hooghly is one of the districts that could decide our fate,"" said the minister. As there is little scope for potato processing in the state, farmers face trouble in getting a fair price for their produce whenever there is a glut. ""The state has an annual consumption requirement of 60 lakh tonnes, but we often produce 120 lakh tonnes.... Such huge surplus production cannot be managed by exporting the crop to other states,"" said an official pointing out the necessity of potato processing units in the district. A senior agriculture marketing department official said: ""The government will try to use the funds in other projects such as setting up packaging units or a cold chain project."""

On a Thursday evening in June 2015, Reddy, a 20-something systems analyst, was part of a throng of thousands jostling through the temple, seeking divine intervention for what would turn out to be a successful, if nervy, visit to the American consulate in Mumbai.For Reddy (who requested his name be changed) and thousands of others targeting an onsite stint or, better yet, a relocation with a technology outsourcer, divine intervention is the last-gasp step to sealing the deal. Reddy now lives in San Francisco. But for many others, the challenges remain daunting. ""The process of moving to the US was nerve-wracking,"" says Reddy. ""Even now, there's always a concern, at the back of the mind, about how much time you have in the US and whether your visa will be renewed.""Still, not everyone is quaking with fear at potential changes to immigration norms  and resultant aftershocks to the visa system. While presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may be making shrill claims on immigration and job losses in the US, Indians working in the country aren't overly concerned. ""Trump is saying all this to get Americans' attention,"" says a 30-something engineer at TCS, who is based in the US.She does not believe much will come of his stand against outsourcing. However, she thinks, the fear Trump is tapping into is not unfounded. ""In India, too, there are concerns in many states about outsiders taking away the jobs of locals."" She can't understand how Trump has come this far in the presidential race as no American she knows supports him.Another Indian engineer who works with a tech giant in Silicon Valley believes that even if Trump wants to do something about outsourcing as president, it may not be easy. ""I am told getting a bill on this passed through Congress is going to be hard. Also, if he becomes president, this may not be top priority for him.""India's outsourcing industry is in the midst of a painful transition and growth has slowed  industry lobby Nasscom has forecast 12% growth for 2016-17, down from 20% in the rah-rah 2000s  even as wildly fluctuating immigration rhetoric in the ongoing US presidential elections, led by Trump, has muddied the waters further.The industry has based its growth on the ability to remotely deliver software services to clients and use a small number of employees on site to help customers roll out the software and systems they have built.While an on-site (on the customer premises) job has been a much-sought-after perk for coders for decades, immigration and visa norms have been a growing hindrance, with costs rising and caps being placed on their issue. In early April, the cap of 85,000 for H1-B visas (including 20,000 for students with a US master's degree or higher) was quickly hit and a lottery system was triggered to select applicants.Companies are aware of the immigration tightrope they walk with their technology talent. In October 2013, Infosys agreed to pay $34 million to end a US investigation into improper use of these visas, even if the company didn't publicly admit to any wrongdoing. The company agreed to take steps to improve its internal processes and outside monitoring too. Infosys declined interview requests for this story.For India's outsourcing industry, trouble is on two fronts. First, immigration concerns (which are seemingly denting the image of companies more than its financials Infosys says higher visa costs will result in a 0.3% erosion in margins); and second, the essential but painful shift in strategy. With automation primed to eat into the Indian outsourcing industry's bread-and-butter business, companies are scrambling to reboot themselves, to focus on higher-value tasks.Industry observers admit that there are concerns on both fronts. ""US elections have always been a hot potato for the Indian outsourcing industry,"" says Avinash Vashistha, former chairman and MD of Accenture India and author of The Offshore Nation. ""Immigration, work visas and exports have always been an emotional leverage that US presidential candidates use to churn emotions.""While these statements have largely been described as election rhetoric by some observers, there could be some pain for the outsourcing industry soon.""We can expect certain restrictive measures as a result of constant lobbying over the years,"" says Vashistha, while arguing that the industry shouldn't make any hasty move because of statements by candidates. Vashistha should know this well. For four years, he helmed the India operations of Accenture, leading the growth in headcount from 50,000 to over 1,30,000, as the company made India its largest presence globally.""Indian companies have been hearing a lot of rhetoric around the immigration issue and visa... and as in the past the companies may end up having to recruit more locally and use sub-contractors more,"" says Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy & marketing officer for Tech Mahindra, India's fifth largest software exporter. ""The only concerns we see are procurement fees and the complexities and cost attached to hiring attorneys (to manage any legal action around this subject). That will remain a painful area for our industry unless the government intervenes.""Mitra contends that proposed legislations to cap short-term H-1B visa numbers would be counter-productive. ""A legislation to cut down the number of H-1B visas by 15,000 and proposing a priority parameter for the highest wage-earner will be counterproductive for the growth of the US technology industry,"" he adds. ""American policy has compensated for the shortage of skilled workers in the country with a carefully calibrated approach that balances immigration with various measures to encourage STEM (science, tech, engineering, math) education and training for Americans.""For companies like Accenture and its peers, the big challenge is decoding what Trump and his rivals mean with their statements on immigration. For example, the billionaire candidate went, in just six months, from being a staunch opponent of outsourcing (and the claimed job losses as a result) to offering to fly in skilled labour to the US.""Trying to understand Trump seems to be a national pastime in the US and no one knows what he really stands for,"" says Peter Bendor-Samuel, chief executive of outsourcing advisory Everest Group. ""There is clearly a growing streak of populism in today's US politics, with both Republican and Democratic parties talking about reexamining long-held assumptions around trade.""As candidates  and the future president among them  reexamine these trade norms, rules around visas and immigration could be tightened. ""What could happen is that visa laws may be changed to make H1-Bs and L1s (temporary work visas that allow American firms to hire foreign workers) more difficult and expensive to get... this would affect the profitability of the Indian firms but not stop their progress,"" adds Bendor-Samuel.What the Trump-led hysteria over immigration and job losses could do is worsen the anti-India sentiment, say experts. ""What Trump has done is to make racism and xenophobia socially acceptable. He is whipping up anti-immigrant, religious, and nationalistic hysteria... this is having a negative effect on businesses and will hurt India,"" says Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow at the Arthur & Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance, Stanford University. ""Things have changed for the worse in America because of this election campaign and Trump. There will be scars long after the elections are over and the popular sentiment will be anti-Indian IT,"" adds Wadhwa.While he contends that Trump has little chance of being elected US president, it is the anti-foreigner, antitrade hysteria that he is whipping up that is harmful. ""He is saying whatever the least educated and most ignorant people in the electorate want to hear,"" adds Wadhwa. ""Trump is a ruthless businessman himself  he does whatever he has to minimise costs and has outsourced projects himself.""Outsourcing veterans such as Raman Roy, who sold his BPO venture Spectramind to Wipro in July 2002 and then founded Quatrro, think that outsourcing has gone too mainstream for the industry to be impacted heavily. ""In IT and BPO, close to a million people would be working out of the US today,"" says Roy. ""Offshoring and outsourcing are a part of life now, they are part of the American DNA. You can rave and rant, shout and make noises, but you can't wish them away.""Despite Trump's anti-trade tirade, Roy reckons that it is premature to be bothered by his over-the-top statements. ""Rhetoric is one thing, reality is another. After all, when they offshore, it is making American companies more profitable,"" he adds. ""It's not like 'India is a poor country, so let's give 5,000 jobs to India'. It doesn't work that way."" Agreeing with Wadhwa on Trump's doublespeak, Roy argues that eventually companies  and not the government  will take a call on jobs.Wadhwa on Trump's doublespeak, Roy argues that eventually companies  and not the government  will take a call on jobs.According to Shivendra Singh, Nasscom's VP for global trade, India's outsourcers make a huge positive impact in making many American corporations globally competitive. ""Low cost is not the rationale for bringing in employees,"" Singh says.""There is a severe shortage of STEM talent in the US  the country's own labour department said there were 3.4 million unfulfilled jobs in this field.""Despite these contentions, India's outsourcers are hit hard, with ""50:50 companies"" (which have over 50 employees and at least half of them on H-1B visas in the US), paying a higher visa fee, under the Omnibus Appropriation Act. ""We protest these moves and have even raised these anti-competitive measures with the WTO,"" says Singh.Away from the immigration hullabaloo, India's outsourcers are also trying to recast their businesses in these challenging times  and the rejig couldn't come any sooner. ""The Indian industry needs to transform itself before it is too late,"" says Wadhwa. ""It is in serious trouble.""Others such as Everest's Bendor-Samuel ascribe this struggle to advances in service delivery automation (SDA), which makes labour arbitrage less important and the ability to embrace new technologies and ways of doing business vital. ""It is highly unlikely that Trump or (Bernie) Sanders' populism will affect the Indian industry,"" he argues. ""But when combined with the industry disruption being driven by SDA, it is likely that the industry is going to change over the next few years.""Companies are already racing to keep pace with these changes. Mitra of Tech Mahindra says his company is focusing on implementation of non-linear initiatives using automation and software platforms, by enabling its clients to digitise their processes and by incubating disruptive solutions internally and by partnering with startups externally.In-house, Tech Mahindra works with a dozen ""startups"" and has a couple of partners outside to try and devise breakthrough technology solutions for customers and the firm even has a start-up garage to incubate out-of-the-box thinking by employees.Former Accenture India chief Vashistha thinks this recast  and the growing noise over visas and immigration -- is a good opportunity for the industry to overhaul itself. ""The digital transformation is increasing the demand for cloud-based services; driving consumers, services and businesses towards mobility; making businesses and consumers more connected through social media; and throwing a plethora of data that can provide very valuable insights,"" he says. ""Yes, it is time for innovation to boost growth.""(Additional reporting by Indulekha Aravind, G Seetharaman, Ishani Duttagupta and Rajiv Singh)"
65,"At its warehouse, Nasscom bets on start-ups",http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/at-its-warehouse-nasscom-bets-on-startups/article8544350.ece,2016-05-02,The Hindu,"more-inavanee Sundaramoorthy cofounded Uncanny Vision, an artificial intelligence start-up, which gives machines an ability to see and analyse like humans, from a garage in a residential area in east Bengaluru. He and other cofounders Ranjith Parakkal and Devadas Parakkal then moved to a proper office on M. G. Road.The founders soon realised that the main hurdle for them is not just workspace, Internet connection or electricity supply, but access to large multinational companies to sell their innovation. Last December, Uncanny Vision moved to Start-up Warehouse formed by IT trade body Nasscom along with Government of Karnataka at Old Airport Road. The co-working space and accelerator for early stage technology product firms is surrounded by tech companies like Intel, Microsoft and Dell. Now every week the Uncanny Vision team meet top executives from big companies like IBM and Bosch, who visit the facility to check out hot technology products.It has been amazing for us. Instead of us going to them, they come to us, said Mr. Sundaramoorthy, 37, who quit his job at chip maker Xilinx to launch the firm. Besides building relationships with these executives, Uncanny Vision has bagged pilot projects from Qualcomm, the worlds largest maker of chips that go inside smartphones and Target Corp, the second-largest discount retailer in the United States.Nasscom, which started as lobbyist for the countrys offshoring industry or big boys club has transformed into a powerhouse for providing infrastructure and mentoring to young firms and helping them to connect with investors. Ashok Madaravally, Deputy Director at Nasscom, said that in the last two decades the organisation helped the IT services industry grow from $1 billion (Rs.6,645 crore) to $140 billion (Rs.9.3 lakh crore). But we realised that the next wave of innovation is going to come from these new age product companies, said Mr. Madaravally, who represents Nasscoms ambitious 10,000 Start-ups programme from Bengaluru. The Start-up Warehouse is part of this programme  that helps young firms with mentoring, funding and industry connects. It expects to have nine such facilities across the country this year.Uncanny Vision, which went through various mentoring programmes has also narrowed down its focus towards the area of surveillance. The firm said that customers would not need to manually monitor the behaviour and activities of people, or other changing information continuously. Its software that sits on surveillance devices such as cameras does it all. The applications range from monitoring elderly patients to the security of buildings.Unlike fancy offices at companies like Google, the Start-up Warehouse is not a Disneyland to have massage chairs or a cafeteria filled with chocolates and potato chips. If you take a stroll around the warehouse, which is equal to a supermarket, one can find a juice shop, traditional coffee containers and food cooked by another small firm that aims to provide nutritionally balanced meal.One of the top guests who visited the warehouse recently was Thuan Pham, Chief Technology Officer at Uber Technologies Inc., the car-sharing service that lets people order transportation via a smartphone. We pitched our product to him (Mr. Pham) and are in talks to take it forward, said Soumik Ukil, 37, Chief Executive at LightMetrics.The firm has developed a technology that helps enterprises to monitor the driving behaviour of their drivers and help prevent accidents and associated losses. Mr. Ukils peer Sarita Mishra, founder of Green Cosmos Energy Solutions has been able to connect with potential clients in markets like Japan, Canada and the Karnataka government. Her firm has developed a cloud-based product RealNatics that analyzes real-time data from smart meters to perform energy consumption forecasts and reduce costs for manufacturing plants and commercial buildings. It would have been difficult to get these contacts on my own, said Ms. Mishra, a former scientist at Indias premier nuclear research facility Bhabha Atomic Research Centre.The warehouse has laboratories for mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT)  a technology where devices communicate with each other intelligently. Townista, which helps people discover and book interesting things to do in the city such as rock climbing, magic shows and tea tasting, has been using these laboratories to test its app on about 30 different types of devices. This is crucial for Paras Jain, 28, who started the firm along with his IIT-Bombay batch mate Snehal Nimje, from his home in Koramangala. But Mr. Jain said the biggest advantage for his team has been learning from peers working at other firms. You can learn from the peers who are already ahead of you and share back the knowledge with people who are lagging behind, he said.For instance, when Mr. Jains peer Parinitha Manohar, founder of Spalontime, that provides an aggregator app for salons and spas, is stuck on a problem, she posts it on common online group. The group includes all the company employees at the warehouse.Either they reply or come to meet me to discuss it, said Ms. Manohar who quit her engineering job at Internet infrastructure company VeriSign to launch the firm.We follow an open culture, so that we can learn from each other, said Roopa Aravindakshan, Community Manager at the warehouse.Marquee investors such as Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners and IDG Ventures also keep flocking the warehouse several times. About 2,000 young firms have been selected for the Nasscoms 10,000 Startups programme in the last three years. Sangeeta Devni, Deputy Manager at 10,000 Startups said that about 200 of these firms raised venture capital or got selected by various accelerators in India and abroad."
66,Everybody loves a good quota,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/everybody-loves-a-good-quota/article8548789.ece,2016-05-03,The Hindu,"I sometimes feel sorry for the governments of Gujarat, Haryana and Rajasthan, which are plagued by demands for reservation from powerful and aggressive communities. Patidars, Jats and Gujjars feel that communities that first managed to board the reservation train are uniting to keep them out. State governments would be perfectly happy to include them in the reserved category if they were not worried about the electoral backlash. Other Backward Classes (OBC) classification for Jats brings a similar demand from Rajputs; Scheduled Tribes (ST) classification for Gujjars brings about protests from the powerful Meena community unwilling to share the ST classification. Gujarat seems to have found a novel way to address these demands: be so inclusive that hardly anyone is left to protest. A 10 per cent quota for the economically backward among upper castes that is, those with family incomes of less than Rs.6 lakh per annum (p.a.)  spreads the net so wide that the excluded group is minuscule.Data on incomeSince income data are hard to come by, let us look at three different sources of data to derive estimates of those with incomes above Rs.6 lakh p.a. First, data on income tax filers in 2012-13 show that only 13 per cent of individual returns have incomes higher than Rs.5.5 lakh p.a.; once we take into account people who do not file the returns at all, this forms about 3.5 per cent of total individuals in the country aged 18 and above. Since incomes may be hidden on tax returns, we must look to alternative data. The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) collects information on consumption expenditure, not incomes. If we apply household savings rate of about 25 per cent, a Rs.6 lakh income p.a. cut-off would result in a cut-off of about Rs.4.5 lakh consumption. NSSO data (2011-12) show that less than 1 per cent of the population falls in this category. A third source of data is the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) of 2011-12, organised by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and University of Maryland. It collects data for both income and expenditure. It shows that less than 2 per cent of the population had household consumption of Rs.4.5 lakh p.a. and about 2.5 per cent had incomes of Rs.6 lakh p.a. in 2011-12. This suggests that whatever statistics we use, a Rs.6 lakh p.a. cut-off will exclude less than 5 per cent of the population from being eligible for reservations if the Gujarat example is followed nationwide.These statistics should calm the passions around this new wrinkle in the battle for reservation in Gujarat. Appeasement tactics used by the Gujarat government are mostly ineffective; they will neither reduce options for middle-income Indians nor will they really expand benefits for the poor among forward castes.Can we devise a narrower band that might really benefit the poor among groups currently ineligible for reservations? Here, our spectacular failure in identifying the poor for issuing Below Poverty Line (BPL) cards gives us reason to be wary. The IHDS survey found that in 2011-12, only 50 per cent of the poor had a BPL card while nearly a third of the non-poor had BPL cards. Almost all observers agree that identifying the poor is a difficult task resulting in errors of both inclusion and exclusion. This is particularly the case when incomes are growing rapidly and a household that is poor in one year may well climb out of poverty the following year. So focussing on just the poor among the general category may be more difficult than we anticipate.Moreover, the demands for expansion of reservation have little to do with the poor among the so-called general category. Most of these demands are emerging from angry young men  many of them with college education  among agriculturalist communities that have historically held considerable political clout (for instance, the Navnirman movement of the 1970s, which the Gujarat government is acutely aware of).Future of reservationIn order to get out of this quagmire, we need to think of the immediate concerns of educated youth and the broader future of reservation in India. What fuels the anger of young men from agricultural communities? As they see it, investing in education has got them only minor monetary benefits. With massive growth in private and distance education programmes of questionable quality, most college graduates today lack the skills for high-paying private sector jobs. They may well be qualified for lower-level clerical or support positions, but for these jobs salaries are far lower in the private sector than the public sector. The ratio of government salary to private sector salary for a college graduate has consistently increased; the IHDS data show that in 2004-05, a college graduate earned 62 paisa in the private sector for each rupee in the public sector; by 2011-12 it had dropped to 57 paisa. With implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission, this difference will grow. Not surprisingly, competition for government jobs is fierce. As Prabhat Mittal, Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh, noted, in 2015 nearly 2.3 million applications were received for 368 low-ranking positions in the State government. Is it surprising that frustrated young men try to beat this insane competition by demanding inclusion in the reserved category? If government salaries were more on a par with the salaries of the private sector, it is possible that this strident demand may subside. If current initiatives for increasing employability and creating more manufacturing jobs succeed, this will also reduce the pressure.A longer-term solution, however, requires re-evaluation of the fundamental nature of Indias reservation regime. Affirmative action to make space for communities that have historically been subject to discrimination fits well with the Indian ethos of creating a level playing field and is part of the Indian Constitution. But the patchwork implementation, particularly for the OBC classification that is currently in place, makes little sense and leaves room for powerful lobbies to unite around demands for inclusion.One of the ways of dismantling the quota raj is to ensure that the reserved category certificate is not a currency that is hoarded by groups who no longer need it. This involves periodic recertification into the reserved category. Unfortunately, the current system has an established, if imperfect, procedure for notification of new groups into the reserved category but not for moving groups out of the reserved category. A first step towards establishing such a process may be to ensure that we collect data on caste/tribe affiliation along with data on basic demographic and housing characteristics in the 2021 population census. This would allow us to move past the exclusive reliance on the 1931 census and obtain information on the current socio-economic conditions of all castes and communities in India.Frankly, I have never understood the resistance from the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India (ORGI) for collecting caste data in national population census. If the colonial census could do this in 1931, why cant we do it today? Collecting data on thousands of castes is difficult, but it is by no means impossible. Perhaps, the collection of data on caste is a hot potato that the ORGI hopes someone else will handle. But surely national interest demands that this caution be put aside to develop a long-term solution to an issue that has gained such visibility. While we are destined for periodic eruptions of demand for reservations by groups like the Jats, without timely and accurate data we have no way of developing a rational system for responding to these demands.Sonalde Desai is Senior Fellow, NCAER, and Professor of Sociology, University of Maryland. Views are personal.If government salarieswere more on a par with the salaries of the private sector, it is possible that this demand may subside"

The prices of few vegetables have doubled in the retail market.Retail traders at the Gandhi Market say that the severe heat waves have an adverse effect on the growth of horticultural crops.The price of tomato has shot up from Rs.10 to Rs.30. Beans which was sold for Rs.15 during January, now costs Rs. 70 a kg. There has been a sharp demand for beans during domestic functions and other important occasions during summer, says M. Gopinath, one of the dealers. The price of brinjal stands at Rs.40 from Rs.25 last fortnight. However, the prices of potato and cabbage remained steady without any hike.Dheen, a trader in carrots, says that the price per kg stood at Rs.20 now registering an increase by Rs. 5 a kg over last months rate. Apart from increase in the price, the quality of vegetables would be far less during the summer season, as the horticultural plants could not be irrigated adequately."

The objective of this fund is to control price volatility, thereby protecting interest of farmers and consumers.Pulses and potatoThe fund is being used for creating buffer stock of pulses and potato also.We are aiming to buy 15,000 tonnes of onion this year. So far, nodal agencies Nafed and SFAC have procured 1,500 tonnes and 800 tonnes, respectively, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan told reporters.The storage quality onion has been purchased directly from farmers in the price range of Rs 8.50-9 per kg. The stock would be kept at Lasalgoan, he said.With onion prices ruling lower at Rs 2-3 per kg in Maharashtra, these two agencies are buying onion in the state to ensure support price to onion growers, he said adding that onion will also be procured from other growing states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The arrival of rabi (winter) crop of onion has began and and cooperative firm NAFED will buy in total 10,000 tonnes, while the Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) will procure 5,000 tonnes.Hiring of godownsOn storage of onions, Mr Paswan said that onion procured from Maharashtra is being stored at Nasik and the nodal agencies have been asked to explore hiring of godowns in other States and even state governments have been told in this regard.A team has been sent to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh to explore godowns for storage of onions, he added.Last year, the government procured 8,000 tonnes of onion but only after retail prices went through the roof.Import plansThis time, the Consumer Affairs Ministry has been asked to prepare timely import plans for pulses and onions.

Spread over on the southern and northern banks of River Bhavani, the town with over four lakh population has been struggling hard to balance environment protection and development.The Mettupalayam Assembly constituency includes the Mettupalayam Municipality, the town panchayats of Sirumugai, Karamadai, Gudalur, No. 4 Veerapandi and village panchayats in the Karamadai Panchayat Union.Agriculture is the primary occupation  banana, vegetables and areca nut being the important crops. The farmers there face challenges in clean water for cultivation, crop destruction from wild animals, and good price. T.T. Rangasamy of the Bhavani River Water and Groundwater Protection Council says that effluents discharged from the textile and paper industries have made the river water unfit for cultivation. That the water is also polluted by sewage from households and the Mettupalayam town residents dont get clean drinking water is another issue.The farmers in forest fringes face the threat of crop destruction by wild animals, particularly wild boar. For the farming community, this is an important issue, which the next representative in the Tamil Nadu Assembly should address, he says.For the residents, supply of polluted water and that too at irregular intervals is a big problem, says N. Venkataraman of the Mettupalayam Consumer Protection Organisation. The town does not have underground drainage facility. The result is that untreated sewage enters River Bhavani, from where the municipality draws water for drinking water supply.This is the most important issue for not only the towns residents but also those in other towns and villages who depend on the river for water.The other issue that comes to the fore from voters is de-congesting the Mettupalayam town. They want the next elected representative to take steps to complete the road-over bridge at Karamadai railway crossing, Mettupalayam bypass road from Karamadai through Guddaiyur and extend the road leading to Ooty.The other solution that the next MLA should try is for increasing the frequency of the Mettupalayam-Coimbatore train service as that will decongest the road, says L.S. Sidduram, advisor, Mettupalayam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.The vegetable traders, who are an economic pillar for the town and nearby areas, have shifted mundies to outside the town. The potato traders are the ones who still remain in Mettupalayam. The next government should take steps to move them and also workshops and scrap merchants to further decongest Mettupalayam, he adds.The voters other demands include an industrial estate or park in Karamadai to encourage entrepreneurs to set shop there, a marketing society for farmers to protect prices and facilities for handloom weavers in Sirumugai and Chikkadasampalayam.Politically, this constituency has been with the AIADMK since 2001. AIADMKs A.K.Selvaraj won that election by over 40,000 votes. Since then it has been a direct contest between the AIADMK and DMK. In the 2006 election, the DMKs B.Arunkumar lost by a wafer-thin margin of 142 votes.This time, the AIADMK has fielded incumbent O.K. Chinnaraj. DMK has fielded S. Surendran and the TMC has given T.S. Shanmugasundaram as part of the Peoples Welfare Alliance."

Sources said food and civil supplies commissioner Rajesh Prasad, who chaired the meeting, impressed upon the traders about the need to comply with the dos and don'ts issued by the local administration to check prices or face action. This after a section of sellers spoke about their ""limited"" role if prices are high at the source, their alleged harassment during ongoing raids and why there was no hue and cry when prices of petrol products fluctuated frequently. As reported in today's edition of The Telegraph, the meeting held at the Circuit House was attended by representatives of wholesalers, retailers, chambers of commerce, railways, Indian Oil Corporation and officials of supply, agriculture, Fishfed and veterinary departments. The meeting was necessitated following the bad press both the state and Union governments had been receiving over price rise. The meeting, sources said, was held in a ""cordial"" atmosphere and the stress was on ""identifying"" the problems and fixing it through ""all-round"" cooperation. A slew of measures (see chart) aimed at both officials and traders were initiated during the meeting where issues connected with the market came to the fore. Sources said vegetable, poultry and fish wholesalers said prices of their products were more or less stable but there was something amiss with the retail market. ""For instance, a kg of parwal/patal (pointed gourd) is Rs 18 kg in the wholesale market but the same item is being sold for Rs 60 a kg in the retail,"" a source said, quoting a wholesaler. There was a discussion to issue receipts to retailers. Vegetables, poultry products and fish do not fall under notified essential items. ""A slight rise in their prices adversely affects household budgets, sparking off heated discussions on and beyond the dining table. This is something we are witnessing now,"" one of the sources said. As part of the measures, the Assam State Agriculture Marketing Board was asked to set up 10 more shops by finalising the location of the plots with help from the district administration. ""There are two markets now. A committee has been formed to finalise the venues within May 10. The wholesalers were asked to upload prices on a daily basis so that it is in the public domain,"" the source said. The task force/enforcement teams in the districts will continue to raid places dealing in food items. Traders warned that prices of potato and pulses, which have stabilised, will see a rise soon because of likely rise in prices at source. ""A few more meetings will be held,"" an official said, indicating that the administration was unlikely to ease the pressure on those dealing in food items. Jorhat shop The Jorhat district wing of the Jatiya Mahila Parishad, a sister concern of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, today set up shop in front of Jorhat Court building and named it Modi Bazar in protest against the high prices of essential commodities. The shopkeeper and helper donned masks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan. A list of essential items and their prices in 2014 was displayed in the shop, with a comparison with prices this year. Siba Kalita, central committee organising secretary, said prices of all essentials, pulses, lentils, sugar, flour, and especially mustard and refined oils had skyrocketed. ""Everything has increased by Rs 40 to 60. The acchhe din promised by Modi has turned out to be really bure (bad),"" he said. The list showed the price of masur dal to have risen from Rs 80 to Rs 110, arhar from Rs 68 and 74 to Rs 100. The organisation demanded an immediate bringing down of prices to the 2014 level, before the NDA government had come to power."

73,Seed potato price not yet fixed,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/546072/seed-potato-price-not-yet.html,2016-05-12,Deccan Herald,"Seed potato price not yet fixedHassan, May 12, 2016, DHNS: 23:47 ISTHassan farmers worried over cultivation, yieldThe district administrations failure in fixing the price for seed potatoes has burdened the farmers, who are already facing crop loss due to drought in the region. This has indirectly helped the traders, who are said to be fleecing the farmers by selling the seeds at a higher price.Potato is a major commercial crop of the district and about 50,000 farmers are involved in its cultivation.Not a single farmer was present at a meeting convened by the district administration on Thursday here, which many farmers felt showed the negligence of the authorities concerned in lending an ear to the problems of farmers.Speaking to Deccan Herald, farmers explained that potato growers usually attend the meeting every year. But, this year, upset over the authorities attitude, no farmer attended the meeting. The failure in fixing the price for the seeds is beneficial for traders, who sell seed potatoes on credit and fleece the farmers, they complained.The traders do not give any receipt for the seeds sold. The farmers too are forced to buy the seeds, accepting the price quoted by the traders under fear that the stocks may exhaust. As there are no receipts, the farmers are eligible for a financial assistance of Rs 5,000 issued by the Agriculture department  Rs 450 for manure, Rs 3,090 for pesticides and Rs 1,540 for other expenses.Earlier, Deputy Commissioner V Anbukumar had intervened and held meetings with the farmers, inspected godowns and fixed a suitable price. This was helpful to the farmers. But after his transfer, the district administration has not shown much interest in the issue. Elected representatives too have turned a blind eye to the problem, the farmers complained.Certified seed potatoes dispatched from Jalandhar, Punjab, are just 2,065 tonnes. This is sufficient for about 500 farmers. According to reports, 56,000 farmers had sown potatoes last year. Hence, 55,500 farmers will get only ordinary seed potatoes, they added.The farmers said they fear blight disease attack and loss of crop if they do not get certified seeds."
74,Guwahati control room to check prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160513/jsp/northeast/story_85311.jsp,2016-05-13,Telegraph,"Guwahati, May 12: The Kamrup (metro) district administration today set up a control room to monitor and check price rise of essential commodities in the city. ""The control room has been set up at the deputy commissioner's office building here for the first time to effectively monitor the prices of essential commodities. Complaints can be made between 8am and 8pm on a given day at the landline phone number, 0361-2733052. An officer will be stationed at the room to address the complaints,"" Jamatul Islam, deputy director, food and civil supplies and consumer affairs, said. Officers will take immediate action on any complaint/information received in regard to anomalies or realisation of exorbitant prices by traders. ""A register on the complaints/information received will also be maintained,"" Islam said. A meeting chaired by state food and civil supplies commissioner here on May 6 had asked representatives of the Assam State Agriculture Marketing Board, Fishfed, supply, agriculture and veterinary departments to take measures against price rise. A committee headed by additional deputy commissioner (supply) Esther Kathar was formed today to hold meetings at regular intervals to review and monitor the market prices of onions and potatoes, green vegetables and fish. The committee will also monitor and review the progress of the mobile vans of Fishfed and the agriculture marketing board from time to time. ""The district administration would do well to ensure that the monitoring and reviewing process remains throughout the year and not when there is an abnormality in the market,"" said a shopper in the Uzan Bazar market. Prices of pulses, onions, potatoes and poultry have over the past month or so spiralled prompting Dispur to take corrective measures. Prior to the May 6 meeting convened by the food and civil supplies department here, the Kamrup (metro) district administration on April 27 formed inspection teams to monitor the development. ""The trend has been brought to our notice and teams have been formed to inspect markets,"" Esther Kathar, additional deputy commissioner, Kamrup (metro), had told The Telegraph. The district administration on May 5 initiated a drive across the city to ensure that essential items were available in the markets at official rates. In an official statement, the administration said 10 teams of officials from the administration and the food and civil supplies department had started carrying out checks in the city's markets, both retail and wholesale. The administration had asked the traders to display the available stock for the day and the rates at which they were sold. The district administration today decided to provide more licenses to wholesale traders under the Assam Trade Articles (Licencing and Control) Order, 1982. Traders have been asked to submit their applications to obtain the licenses."

It has come as a blow to farmers, who are already under financial crisis, due to drought and related issues, he said.Sheshegowda alleged that the board had failed to abide by the guidelines of the government. He said, only a few tobacco growers possess licence and they too have not taken up tobacco cultivation.The number of unauthorised tobacco growers is more, compared to license holders. They can sell their produce only with the cooperation of licence holders. If they have to sell their produce directly, it is inevitable for them to pay a fine to the board. The Tobacco Board has set such regulations, causing inconvenience to the growers, he alleged.CompensationThe World Health Organisation (WHO) had directed the manufacturers of tobacco products to display large visual warnings that cover 85 per cent of the pack surface. But, the Centre has rejected it and decided to use warnings that cover 40 per cent. With the government mulling to control tobacco cultivation, it would affect the farmers, he added.Agents meetingCriticising the meeting held at the Deputy Commissioners office to discuss about seed potatoes on May 12, he said, not a single farmer was invited for the meeting. It was purely a meeting of middlemen, he alleged.The potato growers have been facing loss for the past nine years. Instead of supporting farmers, the district administration is giving importance to traders. There is no proper information on the quantity of certified seed potatoes dispatched from Jalandhar and the expenses incurred. The district adminstration is extorting innocent farmers, he alleged."

The seed potatoes have been kept in cold storage units in the industrial area on the outskirts of Hassan city.As much as 30,000 tonnes of seed potatoes, which have not been certified by any authorised agency, had been procured from Punjab growers. The district administration has decided not to fix the price for them. Merchants will sell them in the market where the price would depend on the demand.At a meeting held in Hassan on Thursday, K.M. Janaki, Additional Deputy Commissioner, gave instructions to officers of Horticulture Department and APMC to ensure farmers are not cheated during the sale.B.

77,Learning skills behind the bars,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/546479/learning-skills-behind-bars.html,2016-05-14,Deccan Herald,"Learning skills behind the barsR Sathyanarayana in Chennai, May 15, 2016 23:59 ISTWhen they were imprisoned for different reasons in Trichy District Prison, most of them were crestfallen. They felt very bad and many regretted their mistakes. They were wondering how would they spend time inside the jail for years together. Now many learn new work and that could ensure better life outside the jail after their release. They take up organic cultivation inside the jail premises.The farming initiative inside the jail complex started a couple of years back, but organic cultivation was launched after A Murugesan took over as the Trichy Jail Superintendent in the middle of last year. Now, organic farming in the prison complex has yielded excellent results in rehabilitating inmates and also providing some financial assistance.Trichy prison complex is spread over 280 acres and 65 acres have been earmarked for farming. Apart from cultivation, the prisoners produce vermicompost and biodegradable waste which are used as natural fertilisers.Murugesan said kitchen waste and dry leaves are collected in a separate bin and crushed with an organic waste crusher, a small tool used for smashing.After crushing, the waste is converted to solid paste. About 20 kg of organic waste yields about 2 kg of solid paste and it is mixed with lime powder and saw dust. After three weeks, the solid paste becomes manure and can be used for gardening, the jail official said.Most of the prisoners had experience in agricultural activities and their knowledge is being effectively used inside the jail, says Murugesan.Accordingly, 75 prisoners are divided into 3 teams and engaged in organic farming. In January 2016, the prisoners cultivated sugarcane for the Pongal festival season. Though it is a tedious work, they produced good quality sugarcane, Murugesan said. Sugarcane was sold at 25 % less than the market price. Out of the profits earned, 25 % share is given to the labourers, he said.Organic farming experts assist and regularly monitor the green project. As a result, acres of fallow land have been converted into productive land and vegetables are grown. Most of it is consumed in the jail and excess is sold through prison bazaars. The prison holds gardening classes and this year it has engaged the inmates in classes related to gardening and sustainability.The idea to engage them in organic farming was born out of the growing popularity of vegetables and fruits produced in a natural way without use of chemicals. Such vegetables and other agricultural products are in huge demand in the market. In the prison, 65 acres of land has been divided into 3 different units. Paddy is grown in one portion and vegetables and onion and potato in other two sections.The prison official said like last year, ADT-39 high quality variety paddy will be planted even this season and only organic manure will be used.Last year we produced 4,000 kg good rice. The rice was sold in the prison bazaar run by a group of convicts, Murugesan said. Now, brinjal and tomatoes have been grown this year and a good quantity is sold in the market regularly.Initially, buyers were reluctant to purchase vegetables cultivated inside the prison. However, when jail officials advertised that vegetables will be sold at 25 % less than the market price, people started queuing up every day to purchase the fresh vegetables.He claimed that vegetables are sold out in a couple of hours. Now we get very good response from the buyers at market also, the official said.Besides brinjal and tomatoes, coconut, banana, mango, jackfruit and lemon are grown. As we have adopted rain water harvesting method in and around the prison complex, we do not face water scarcity throughout the year, Murugesan said. The prison has two wells to meet the water requirement.The inmates are gearing up for cultivation of onion and garlic. As onion prices fluctuate every year, we stock it and save a lot of money, the jail superintendent said.The jail inmates are happy with their work. After their breakfast, the inmates work in the field. They forget everything and their work gives them a lot of satisfaction, Murugesan said. They are engaged for about 6 to 7 hours in farming activities.The initiative is aimed at giving convicts a chance to reform and rehabilitate. Prisoners released early for good conduct have an opportunity to utilise the experience to lead a decent life outside the jail. In addition, the skill provides inmates with satisfying work, marketable talent and fresh food to eat, he said.Sources said that prisoners, on their release, get assistance from the government. In many instances, loans and marketing facilities are arranged for the released prisoners.After their release, more than 20 inmates have started their own farming business with the help of the local authorities, a jail official said. We also help the ex-prisoners to open their own bank accounts if required, he added.Murugesan said the jail management is also taking measures for apiculture and poultry in the future."
78,Where water is hallmarked gold,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Where-water-is-hallmarked-gold/articleshow/52276574.cms,2016-05-15,The Times Of India,"What worries 22-year old Jamnaben Dashratbhai, a resident of Kundalia, is not whether Gujarat Lions will win the IPL or whether BJP will win the Kerala assembly polls. It is unwashed clothes piling up over a week that has got her goat. Kundalia, located 30 km from Pakistan, is one of the 52 drought-hit villages of Banaskantha. Residents here are univocally furious with the state government for depriving them of Narmada water like those in the rest of the 1114 drought-hit villages. But what particularly annoys this expectant mother is that a water tanker, ""which turns up once in three days and at no fixed time"", dictates how and when she should go about her domestic chores.It's been three hours since her family members called for the tanker and it has not arrived yet. She says that sometimes the tanker does not turn up for days and her family goes without a bath for an entire week. ""If the driver feels like it, he will oblige. As such, the tanker supplies water for about 45 mins which is not enough for the village,"" she says. Of the 2,500 families in Kundalia, only 600 live in pucca houses. The rest live in tents on their farms. As farming is out of question, the menfolk work as labourers and take up carpentry and plumbery in Deesa, the nearest town.""We get paid Rs 100 to Rs 200 a day. We would not be at the mercy of others if the government just gave us water to irrigate our fields. We can then grow bajra, jeeru, matth and moong,"" says Samthabhai Suthar, 40. Soon, a tanker arrives, honking continuously, and parks itself near a dirty cattle trough. Balancing metal pots on their heads, the womenfolk rush to the spot. They queue up to fill water from the tanker tube while the thirsty cattle lap up water from the trough. A war of words breaks out inevitably because everybody is in a hurry.Sometimes, a ""miracle"" happens, as one of them puts it  The village school receives a trickle of water from the Deesa pipeline and the women queue up there. Prakash Goswami, 22, a resident, says, ""Women walk down four km daily to fetch water. At times, they are forced to return without a drop because 10,000 litres of water provided by the tanker is not enough for the village. A family of six needs at least 200 litres daily. The village has a huge water tank, but the stored water turns saline since this is a desert area."" Water seems to be the single most deciding factor that determines their future  in Kundalia, education is a privilege for boys alone as the families do not allow girls to attend school because ""who will go and fetch water then?""The village has seen about two to three divorce cases in the recent past because of the water issue. ""Our neighbours have left the village and moved to Ahmedabad. Some time ago, their daughter-inlaw left them because she was tired of making daily trips for water,"" he says, adding, ""That is what happens when you go looking for girls from another village. They cannot adjust to our circumstances."" During the wedding season or festivities, the village orders for food and water from Tharad taluka. Interestingly, one or two shops in the village sell local soft drink brands, but water is too much to ask for. ""A water tanker is hardly seen here, but the soft-drink vans always do the rounds and ensure the shops have enough supply,"" says Lalji Rajput, 22, who works in a diamond polishing unit nearby.Villagers can diss the state government as much as they want but sarpanch Karsan Rajput gives the administration a clean chit. ""A lot of people here live on the farms here and they break the pipelines supplying water from the Deesa outlet. Since we are a village at the farthest end of Banaskantha, we do not receive water. It is not the government's fault,"" he says. ""How is it not the government's fault? If people are resorting to such illegal ways, surely some action can be taken. Why can't they ensure us a steady supply of water like it does for the rest of the world?"" asks Prakash.Around 5 km ahead of Kundalia is Radha Nesda, the first village of Gujarat that is entirely powered by solar energy. Almost every mud house ('bhunga') here is fitted with solar panels. Recently, the state government also allocated 1,407 hectares of land here to Gujarat Power Corporation to set up a 750 MW ultra-mega solar plant. So while the villagers are thankful for the power supply, they complain about being sidelined by the government when it comes to paani. Around 350 families and livestock live in this arid region. Valiben Mavabhai, 55, a resident, says she has lost count of the cattle that died due to perennial water scarcity in the region.Villagers survive on the water found in the small wells ('virda') they dig on their farms. If they are lucky, the water is sweet, but it doesn't remain so beyond 10 days. So they abandon that well and dig another. ""We survive on the virda as long as it lasts. Once the water turns saline, we dig another. This has been going on for decades now. We have more or less accepted the fact that we will never get water. The tankers only provide water to the Border Security Forces,"" she says. Every morning, she leaves home with her husband for Deesa to look for work and the couple returns by night. Bajri no rotlo, batata nu shaak and chhas is the staple food of this region. ""Usually we get paid Rs 100- 200 a day. If we get lucky, we buy onions on the way and make dungli nu shaak,"" she says.The hardships faced by the villagers of Suigam, around 35 km from Kundalia, are no different. The only silver lining is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act project that has them busy these days. On Friday, ahead of CM Anandiben Patel's visit to Suigam, around 300 villagers were out in Jodiya digging earthen bunds for rain water harvesting. The bunds, a 100-day project, can store water for two months during monsoon. They were provided Banas Dairy buttermilk packets by MNREGA officials. A water tanker was also parked here for these workers.""This is all a show. Just because the CM is visiting today, you see a water tanker parked here. Otherwise, you will never see one in our village,"" says Talabhai Parmar, 30. While MNREGA's Deputy DPC P M Gorecha hailed the bund project as a blessing for the villagers battling acute water scarcity, the latter feel doubly cheated. ""It usually rains here in July. By then the bunds will be ready to store water and the 1,435 families that live here will be benefited. Besides, we are providing employment to the villagers and also creating assets for them,"" he said. But sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput is not excited about the project. ""Firstly, we would not have to be part of such a project if we they simply give us water from the Narmada canal. Secondly, the MNREGA labour charges are a pittance. We get paid only Rs 178 per head for the work whereas the same work for a private contractor will earn us Rs 300,"" complains sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput, who has a debt of Rs 4 lakh. He claims he has been submitting memorandum seeking Narmada water to the state government for the past seven years, but to no avail.""It would be nice if agricultural loans were given to us at 1% interest rate instead of 7%. We find it difficult to sustain ourselves,"" says Rajput, adding, ""We spend Rs 200 every day on fodder for cattle and they produce just 3 litre of milk daily. If there is regular water supply, we can feed them green fodder and they can produce 6-7 litres of milk."" He along with others from the village go to Deesa to work on potato plantations or construction of roads and buildings.Only 100 families in Suigam get water from the Deesa pipeline, which is released to a common livestock trough here for 20 minutes to an hour every third day. Villagers come walking from as far as six km and queue up here in the afternoon. The tankers supply water to the villagers only once in three days. Asked how they were coping with the water crisis Maniben Bhurabhai, 30, says, ""How does anyone care about us? If you go without taking bath for a week and walk down six kms with three pots on your head, you'll now how we are coping up."""

The WPI had fallen 0.85% in March. The industry did not expect change in prices going forward as the monsoon forecast cited a delay in arrival of south-west monsoon.While some price pressure is noted in case of select food items, we dont foresee any significant change in the near term in the inflation trajectory, industry body FICCI said.Prices of products of national interest, including pulses, food articles, cereals and wheat, have been continuously rising, the policymakers should check and address this through supply side responses, said Assocham."

83,Will Congress wrest the seat from AIADMK?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-congress-wrest-the-seat-from-aiadmk/article8598274.ece,2016-05-18,The Hindu,"Plagued by infrastructure inadequacies on one side and mounting pressure caused by increasing tourism on the other, Udhagamandalam is all set to see the battle of ballots with Congress making a bid to wrest the seat from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).Udhagamandalam, a most sought after hill station by domestic and international tourists, is reeling under various infrastructure inadequacies and people in the hills have started migrating to the plains for the sake of higher education and healthcare. Continued neglect in terms of infrastructure by the successive governments has resulted in the Queen of Hills loosing her sheen.Since 1957, the constituency has returned Congress nominees eight times, nominee of the Swatandra party once besides giving the AIADMK and DMK a chance twice each. In 2011, the constituency returned sitting MLA M. Budhichandran who was inducted into the cabinet for a brief period.Fund-starved Udhagamandalam Municipality had not been able to make any progress in terms of infrastructure and the constituencys demographic profile includes a mixture of Badagas, Christians, Keralites, Kannadigas and Muslims.Ban on issue of patta on one side and rampant building rule violations on the other are the major issues that the electorate hold against the successive ruling parties. Tourism, horticulture and plantations remain the key economic factors for this hill-station.K.A. Bhojan, a resident of Udhagamandalam for the last 26 years, says that there is a burgeoning vehicular population, but the town roads remain very narrow without any adequate parking space resulting in congestion becoming the order of the day. The town had been growing vertically and horizontal growth was very minimum, he added.Similarly, the water supply schemes that the Municipality depends are proving to be grossly inadequate. In the absence of a strong political leadership in the district, despite change of governments, MLAs were not able to get sanctions for any foresighted projects taking into account the long term requirements. Many of the projects were envisaged and implemented by the British.With cup of woes overflowing, Dharmalingam Venugopal of Nilgiris Documentation Centre has entered the fray taking on the Dravidian majors, national and regional party nominees.His campaign remains very simple Vote for Ooty. Mr. Venugopals campaign also focuses on renaming Udhagamandalam as Ooty as it is popularly known to the rest of the world.He pointed out that the hill district needs a lot of infrastructure as it attracted close to 25 lakh tourists an year and more than 50 per cent of them from Southern States and the rest from all over India and from abroad. He also calls for reasonable price for tea and for the vegetables that are grown here such as carrot, cauliflower, potato and broccoli.Political leaders and top bureaucrats, who come to Udhagamandalam for vacations, promise to do something for betterment of the town but seldom remember that on their return from vacation, says a leading hotels manager on condition of anonymity. The hill district capital is yet to get an engineering college and the trauma care facilities at Government Hospital at Udhagamandalam requires a lot of improvement.Interestingly, the constituency which is a sought after spot for film shooting has only three theatres and promises of the past namely introduction of rope car and many other infrastructure to aid tourism is yet to translate into reality on the ground, Mr. Bhojan added.There is no scientific study or a permanent solution to the problem of land slips which at some times cuts off the connectivity for the district with the plains.The much talked about proposal for a third route to the Nilgiris (besides the one via Kotagiri and the other via Coonoor) has not seen the light of the day owing to issues of environment clearance.Promising to resolve all or at least many of the issues, the candidates locking horns are R. Ganesh of the Indian National Congress (INC) D. Vinodh of AIADMK, K. King Narcissus of DMDK and J. Raman of BJP."

Most of them are being sold for Rs 50 a kilogram. The price of green chilly has gone up to Rs 180-200/kg, up from Rs 100 last week. Beans now come for Rs 65 a kg.Drought in neighbouring states and heatwave in several parts of Odisha has destroyed harvest and pushed up the prices of vegetables, said sellers.""If prices were to go up like this, how will one manage the family expenses? Potatoes and onions are being sold for more than Rs 20 for the last few months. Now even the vegetable prices are burning a hole in our pockets,"" groused homemaker Mamta Rath, who shopped from a wholesale market in Unit-I instead of the retail shops next to her house, to save some extra bucks.As such vegetable prices remain high during summer months every year, but this season has been bad as the harvest of green vegetables was affected. The production in most vegetable-growing areas in the state has gone down significantly, thereby affecting supply to the city market.The quantity and quality of vegetables has gone down in the last few weeks due to severe heatwave condition and water scarcity in most parts of the state.""The supply of green vegetables from Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal has also gone down due to drought-like situation in these states,"" said Susant Samantray, a vendor of Unit-I market.While vegetables like tomato, beans, brinjal, pointed and bitter gourd have gone beyond the reach of common people, even the humble pumpkin and papaya are selling for Rs 20 and Rs 30 per kg, respectively.Meanwhile, the state horticulture department expressed helplessness over the rising prices. ""The government does not have any control over the vegetable market as it is highly unregulated,"" said an official of the department."
86,On an organic quest,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/on-an-organic-quest/article8635129.ece,2016-05-23,The Hindu,"Theres an annoying self-satisfied swagger about hipster organic stores; the ones with artfully-lit, Instagram-ready baskets of fastidiously rustic fruit. Exotic vegetables flaunting back-stories more romantic than anything you could ever find on Tinder. Boasting of lovingly hand-pounded, responsibly made, locally-grown, ethically produced, vegan, wild honey-laced breakfast cereals that taste like diligently toasted sand.Lets not even get started on their star customers, swathed in overpriced ethnic handloom, diamonds and self-congratulatory smugness. They dexterously manage to post virtuous Facebook updates about changing the world, one organic carrot at a time, even as they fill their baskets with home-grown quinoa, designer ghee and gently wilting broccoli.Indias burgeoning organic food market, slated to grow by 30 per cent every year, offers wide variety today: ranging from the stolidly indigenous to wildly exotic. With bohemian chic farmers markets springing up in every big city, and swish neighbourhood stores advertising responsibly-grown produce, it has never been easier to eat clean and simultaneously assuage our conscience. After all, if its good for us, it must be good for the planet, right? As for that hefty price tag? Well, clever marketing has us convinced that good food cannot possibly be cheap. Granted, most people who are going organic now are doing it with genuinely good intentions. However, in a trend-obsessed world, it is easy to get overwhelmed.If you truly want to change the way you eat, what should you be looking for? Choitresh Kumar Ganguly of the Timbaktu Collective seems like the ideal person to ask. The collective, which works in over 150 villages in drought-prone Anantapur, has taken unproductive land and, using organic farming, transformed it into fields of flourishing millets over the last 25 years.Ganguly begins by emphasising how important it is to eat food that is indigenous. Millets, for example. Foxtail barnyard millets grow in high-lying marshes as well as low-lying deserts. They are climate-resilient and can survive on very low rainfall. Since these are local species, theyre also rarely attacked by pests.As for that organic quinoa, carefully imported and grown in India? Its all bull, he snorts. Thats the tragedy of us Indians. We dont give importance to what we already have.Remember that any imported seed needs protection, since it is not naturally immune to the local environment and pests. Over a few thousand years, they become resilient, like our chillies, potatoes and tomatoes. But in the meantime, it may destroy a lot of our vegetation by activating pests, or affecting our pollination system.So how do you define organic? The primary meaning, to me, is when all the inputs are produced by the farmer himself or herself. From seed to fertilizer to pesticide everything.After all, natural is an easy term to manipulate: bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides are technically natural too. When the farmer controls the entire process, using dung from village cattle, neem cakes and local earthworms, its a simpler, cleaner, and more straightforward process. It also means that the farmer has full control. Sovereignty is what is important here.Your next step? Cut out the middleman. As a consumer, you should know who is producing your food. Most of the people selling organic food are aggregators; they have little or no contact with the actual farmers. Conventional certification is not always reliable. We have been fighting against third-party certification. All kinds of scams can happen and it is very expensive.Instead, they use a Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) where groups of farmers guarantee each others produce. (The Government of India has recently introduced PGS as well.) So look for PGS on produce that you buy.Even better, get to know your farmer. Its increasingly easy these days, as more urban city slickers are swapping their laptops for shovels.Like 51-year-old S. Madhusudhan, who gave up a high-powered corporate career to start a farm six years ago in Bengaluru, after he collapsed in his office. That was my wake-up call, he says, discussing how he taught himself organic farming. My best teachers were Google, Wikipedia and YouTube. Over the past six years, he has tended about 200 acres at Back2Basics, lavishing his land with equal amounts of care and gobar (cow dung) slurry. We use about 24,000 litres of gobar slurry per acre. We use oil seed cakes made with neem, honge and sesame. We used a bore, and struck water at 550 feet. Today, after rainwater harvesting, its risen to 50 feet. I truly believe that the land returns what you give to it. Economically, he says, there is no reason for organic food to be more expensive. I sell a coconut at Rs. 19. The market price is Rs. 30. How do I do it? I just cut out the middleman.His farm has been so successful that he recently launched a service supplying customers with freshly-harvested produce. Morning harvest, evening delivery, he says. I quickly learnt what the problem is in the Indian market. The growers dont know how to market. The marketers dont know how to grow. Im in the sweet spot between the two."

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe spiralling cost of tomatoes may make shopping for vegetables costlier for consumers. The price of this staple vegetable has shot up by nearly three times from last week, leaving many consumers in shock.According to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, a kilo of tomatoes was priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 last week.This week, a box of tomatoes consisting of 25 kilos cost Rs. 1,250. In the wholesale market, the price is Rs. 50 per kilo. Retailers sell a kilo at Rs. 60, he said.Like tomatoes, the cost of a number of vegetables has skyrocketed. This was mainly due to less production in summer, he said, adding, Vellore gets its supply of tomatoes from Andhra Pradesh. Supply is hit due to low production due to the heat conditions.Vegetables such as brinjal, beans and avarakkai cost more as the yield is low.A kilo of brinjal (thorn variety) costs Rs. 40, while buying beans could burn a hole in the pockets of consumers. A kilo of beans is priced at Rs. 80 to 100, while avarakkai costs Rs. 60, he said.Onions offer consolation for consumers as the price continue to be normal at Rs. 10 to 15. In fact, this was less when compared to last months rate, Mr. Balu noted.The cost of other vegetables are (a kilo): small onion Rs. 40, potato  Rs. 20 to Rs. 24, drumstick Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, carrot  Rs. 40, cabbage  Rs. 20, ladys finger  40, snake gourd Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, bitter gourd  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, green chillies  Rs. 50, ginger  Rs. 50, beetroot  Rs. 30 and a bunch of coriander is Rs. 30 to Rs. 40.Mr. Balu added that it was not the season for peas and cauliflower. Cauliflower might be sold but it will not be of good quality, he added.For consumers, there might not be any relief from these skyrocketing prices for now.He said that the rates of vegetables would continue to be high for at least a month."

Telegraph picture Unicef, in collaboration with Rajendra Agricultural University, Pusa, has come up with an initiative to address the malnutrition problem in the state. The state chapter of Unicef will sign a memorandum of understanding with the university on May 26, according to which, the latterwill work towards promoting farming of food crops, fruits and vegetables in various districts. The university, which already has collaborations with various Kisan Kendras, will provide technical training to farmers on growing crops that will be of low cost. This will make it available to people from the backward sections of the society. ""There are many crops such as ragi and millet that farmers don't cultivate in large scale nowadays,"" said a Unicef official wishing anonymity. ""These crops are rich in iron and protein. The joint initiative of Unicef and the university will ensure farming of these crops in various districts. Many children across the state are malnourished because their families do nit have access to nutritious food. A proper diet can work wonders and the collaboration will help in addressing the threat that malnutrition poses to the future of the state."" He said apart from cultivation of crops high on nutrition, healthy snacks will also be produced. According to the National Family Health Survey-4, 61 per cent children in the state suffer from stunted growth which is a direct consequence of malnutrition. The survey also says only 30 per cent children between six and eight months of age are given supplementary food in the state. The Clinical Anthropometric and Biochemical Survey, conducted by the country's registrar-general's office,lists Bihar among the top nine states in the country that have highest number of malnourished children under five years of age. According to the survey, Patna, East Champaran, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Darbhanga and Gaya make for one-third of the total number of malnourished children in the state.

Sinha, a doctor at the medicine department of Patna Medical College and Hospital. ""The mortality (chances of less span of life) and morbidity (developing disease) rates in malnourished children arehigher than in normal kids."""

But, they cannot replace tomatoes and chilli with something else.Hence, retail buyers tend to reduce the quantity or frequency of purchase.Even institutional buyers are reducing use of tomatoes, say sources.In Tirupur, prices of almost all the vegetables, except brinjal, had seen an upward trend.In Salem, even while the price of other vegetables remained stable in both, the Uzhavar Santhais and open markets, the price of tomato has soared in the last two days, thanks to the drop in arrivals. The price of tomato which remained at Rs. 45 a kg in the uzhavar santhais on Sunday, rose to Rs. 62 on Tuesday.Market sources said that the local tomato season had come to an end.The uzhavar santhais and the open markets were getting tomatoes from Rayakottai and other parts in Krishnagiri district, and also from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.With the fall in the arrival from Andhra Pradesh, the markets have to totally depend on the tomatoes from Krishnagiri district for the last few days and the drop in arrivals is one of the reasons for the prices going up.The price of beans continue to remain high at Rs. 76 to Rs. 86 a kg in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 100 in the open markets in Salem. This is mainly due to the drop in the arrival of vegetables from Bengaluru.The price of brinjal remained at Rs. 10 in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 20 in open markets on Tuesday, potato Rs. 26 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 30 in open markets, small onion Rs. 45 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 50 in open markets; chilli Rs. 45 to Rs. 50 in santhais and Rs. 60 in open markets.The prices of almost all the vegetables are expected to drop in 10 days when the monsoon sets in, Mr. Rajendran said.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem; M.

(Express photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi) Former Union HRD minister Kapil Sibal (right) with Chief of Bureau Maneesh Chhibber at The Indian Express office in Delhi. (Express photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi)Why Kapil Sibal?Kapil Sibal held the important portfolios of HRD and Telecom in the UPA government. The changes in education system brought in under him are now being examined by the Smriti Irani-led ministry. He remains one of the leading lights of the Congress and was recently nominated by the party, that is looking for strong voices in Parliament, for a Rajya Sabha ticket. A legal eagle, Sibal has returned to a successful practice and is leading the Gandhi familys defence in the National Herald caseKAPIL SIBAL: My biggest worry for the country is that an aspirational India finds itself in great difficulty. When we talk about our demographic advantage, the young people in this country find the education system not fully aligned to the market. Also, when they get out of the university, they cant get jobs. And remember there are about 12 million people who move out of the university into the job market every year. The maximum job creation was in 2009, with 1.2 million jobs as opposed to the 12 million required, and there has been a constant decline after that. So I wonder what those 12 million will do. Whatever you do in life, if its disengaged, its a perilous journey not just for them individually but for the nation. I think political parties must get together because remember, there is no quick fix to this.It must start from the education system; from the schools. But the education system cannot be tweaked unless you have teachers. Teachers dont come from the air unless you have institutions to teach. Having done that, you move up the school ladder and go to the universities. What is the kind of teaching you must have in your university? What kind of a market interface must you have with the educational system? Where are the jobs being created? Where in future will jobs be created? Then align the education system to that opportunity within the economy, and you will have a purposive India. I dont see that happening; I dont see political parties discussing this.WATCH: Idea Exchange With Kapil SibalI only see angst, a sense of destruction through verbal abuse, allegations without proof, (talk of) a Congress-mukt Bharat, as if that will save this country from the impediments ahead. Thats my greatest worry, and unless you fix this, there is nothing else that will be fixed.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The Modi government has completed two years and we all saw what happened at India Gate. So the impression that one got was that we are growing as a nation.I would love the nation to grow; I have no problem with that. I just have a problem with the statistics that he (PM Modi) has churned up. One of the statistics that he gave was of new ration cards  three crore. It is only 66 lakh. Then he said my Jan-Dhan (Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana), in the first 100 days, saw 21 crore accounts. The fact is 8.6 crore. He said we have given new LPG cylinders to crores of people, but actually its only 45 lakh. So if the Prime Minister of India, at India Gate, talks of statistics which are incorrect, then how do you trust our leaders?The Central Statistical Organisation is also giving out data which economists are now questioning. So you may tom-tom about yourself but the fact of the matter is what is on the ground, and we all see that.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The aam aadmi seems to be buying these statistics.If dal is Rs 200 (a kilogram), then how is he buying these statistics? His income has not increased. If vegetables are as expensive as they are now, and if one tonne of potato sells for one rupee, then what statistics are we talking about? And whats the feel-good factor on the ground? What worries me is that you may have a wonderful advertising campaign but the fact of the matter is that when the voter thinks about himself, hell ask the question to himself at the right time  Has my life improved?. For the last 17 months, exports have been on the decline; imports are on the decline. So whats on the up? Modi. Nothing else is on the up.MANEESH CHHIBBER: So how does the Congress party plan to expose the government?I think we must take this message to the people. I think the media also needs to investigate this at the same time. When he (PM Modi) gives a statistic for example he said in America that India is a $9 trillion economy, when were just about near 2 trillion. Now the press did not pick it up. So how do we deal with this? They repeat the same statistics. He goes to Kerala and compares us with Somalia. Of course he got some flak for that, but I think every time he makes a statement, for him its an election rally speech You dont act like the Prime Minister of India; you act as if youre an RSS pracharak. You spew venom and you give statistics thinking that its the next election. And then suddenly, one of them goes and has food at a Dalits house when hes not even a Dalit. You should remember Modis tweet on a previous occasion about this.COOMI KAPOOR: Why has the Congress not been able to capitalise on the failures of the Modi government? And the Congresss own position has come down in the last two years. It has lost its stronghold in Kerala, in Bengal, in AssamSince when did a government in Kerala win a second term? Thats the pattern. As far as Assam is concerned, were deeply disappointed about that, but how many chief ministers have got a fourth term in the history of this country? Hardly any. Our vote percentage in Assam is 31 per cent. I think where we might have gone wrong is with the alliances. In West Bengal, we have emerged actually as an alternative to the TMC, because in our alliance we have gained much more and were now leading the Opposition there. The DMK, I think, was a great disappointment because there the pattern also is the AIADMK and DMK. We could have won. I think again, if we had made some alliances, we might well have succeeded. But if you look at it overall, the BJP fought 696 (Assembly) seats (in all) and got 64, and we fought 335 and got 135.AMBREEN KHAN: Sonia Gandhi said the Prime Minister behaves like a Shahenshah. What does that imply?I think Arun Shourie put it very well in the course of his interview  narcissism, megalomania, trying to control the government, a statue at Madame Tussauds. They give you an indication of the persona of the Prime Minister. Giving out statistics without regard to the truth and basically concentrating everything in the PMO, not allowing his ministers the kind of freedom that was allowed during the UPA government these are personal traits of character wearing a name-printed striped suite and then auctioning it off. These are all very significant characteristics of a man who basically is in love with himself, which is not a bad thing, but in politics it may not sometimes succeed for a long period of time.LIZ MATHEW: Regional parties have been successful in keeping out the BJP to an extent. But why has the BJP managed to defeat the Congress so easily?If you go back to analyse the decline of the Congress party, I think we go back several years, to the compromises that we made with regional parties by sharing seats What happens in politics is that the moment you compromise for sharing of seats, then your entire cadre shifts from one party to the other, and thats the genesis of the decline of our regional presence.We did it in Uttar Pradesh, and see the consequences of it. We have not done it in Odisha but there the Congress has been a weak force for a long time. Luckily, we are now the alternative in West Bengal. I dont think we made a mistake because, had we gone with the TMC, we would have landed in a much worse position.SHALINI NAIR: The Prime Minister often raises the point that governance under the NDA, unlike the Congress regime, has been corruption-free.What are the charges of corruption against the Congress party during the UPA regime? It started in 2010-11 with the telecom issue. What was the corruption there? We did not sell the spectrum because the policy was not to sell. It may be right, it may be wrong, the Supreme Court ultimately said it was wrong, so you auction it. What is the result of that auction? That the very telecom sector which bought 5 Megahertz of spectrum at an administered price of Rs1,680 crore buys it for Rs 45,000 crore and that goes to the consolidated fund of India. Now, you will not call this a scam, because all this money has gone to the Government of India, which should have gone to the sector, so the result is that, by calling it a scam, and by reversing the policy, you have, in fact, destroyed the sector. The same with coal, nobody wants a coal mine anymore.RITIKA CHOPRA: In a recent interview, Smriti Irani said that during her predecessors regime, education had become a political akhada, states wouldnt see eye to eye, whereas she has achieved consensus.I dont want to react to what Smriti Irani says. I think the people of this country know how the education department is being run. Did we appoint RSS people or Congress-minded people as vice-chancellors of universities? Did we appoint people of a particular ideology as directors of IIT? Was there a controversy about the Prime Ministers degree? What about the corruption in Madhya Pradesh, the Vyapam scam? Is that not the BJP?AMITABH SINHA: As a former HRD minister, what is your opinion on Smriti Iranis tenure so far?Im not worried about individuals, Im worried about the change of textbooks, Im worried about the effacing of history, Im worried about a Vedic board being created. See, these are real worries. You tell Ramdev that you can have a private Vedic board in India so that our children get aligned to that ideology as they grow up. Im worried about that. Im not worried about Smriti Irani, Im worried about what she symbolises.LIZ MATHEW: After the rout in the recent state elections, some in the Congress have talked about surgery and changes in the party. What do you think is the way forward?Surgery of a political party will not change the future of India. We need to do a lot of things within the Congress party, but thats not enough. We are here for the nation, we are not here for the Congress. We are presenting an alternative, right? That may be an unacceptable alternative, to that extent we need to change, to provide a wholly acceptable alternative, and people who have voted against us, we must bring them back to our fold, to say that this is the only party that recognises the needs, the aspirations, and the pain of every Indian.SHEELA BHATT: Sonia Gandhi called the charges against Robert Vadra a conspiracy. But why make it political?Who says dont investigate? But you leak the email to the media, then you have the media play it up, that is what Mrs Gandhi is talking about. Your intentions are not to investigate in a fair manner, your intention is to besmirch the name, to have another way of saying you want to have a Congress-mukt Bharat. Who is stopping your investigation? Did we say dont investigate? Why dont they agree to an SIT under the Supreme Court? In all these allegations, have you found a single case where a Congress person has been convicted? This is all media stuff. You get something, you leak something, then you give a spin to it, then the Finance Minister writes a blog, then his people go up on television, then you create an atmosphere, and then you say he is corrupt. And when it comes to you, that piece of paper that names family members of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and the money trail, then thats irrelevant.COOMI KAPOOR: Some people see similarities between Narendra Modi and Donald Trump. What is your opinion?Let Donald Trump fight the election then I will give you my opinion. But you have my opinion of Modi anyway.MANEESH CHHIBBER: Why is the Congress party always defending Robert Vadra and his alleged wrongdoings?The point is that he happens to be associated with a person who is part of the family of the Congress leadership. So when you make an allegation against him, in a sense you are making an allegation against the Congress party. If the Congress party does not respond, then you would say that the Congress party has accepted it. Fact of the matter is, if you make a false allegation, the person is entitled to say it is false.AFRAZ ALAM: This whole wave of admiration for Modis work has only increased in the last two years. Even if the people start rethinking about their decision to choose Modi, what is the alternative?You must know that there is an army out there, which is funded by a particular political party, which has enormous presence in the social media to serve a particular purpose. That army whenever I say something will attack me within two minutes, then they will praise Modi. It is a self-serving army which is part of the narcissism that I talked about. There is a lot of trolling against Modi today I bet that in the next two years, you will have an alternative. An alternative that will be far more compassionate, far more acceptable, far more inclusive and far less obsessed with himself or herself.ANANT GOENKA: Do you agree then there is a need for an internal organisational change in the Congress?There is no dispute that reform is needed. You ask us about the big idea, but Modi did not come with any big idea. It was lies, lies and damn lies. He was selling a dream and a person who looks forward to the next day for survival will buy a dream. So people of this country bought a dream.AMBREEN KHAN : So who will be able to sell the big dream in Uttar Pradesh?We should go back to the people of this country and say, We will not tell you lies, we will try and tell you what the reality is, believe us and give us a chance. All these guys have fooled you by telling lies, we will not do that. I think it is time for us to tell this to the people of our country.MANEESH CHHIBBER: We saw what happened in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. What is your partys take on it?I think we need an amendment in the defection law. We should have a new law which says two things: first, that you are free to defect, but if you defect, you will not get a public position for the next five years. Even if you succeed in an election, you will not get a public position or ministerial post in the next five years. If you defect in the middle of your term, you will not be entitled to stand for elections in the middle of that term. If you do that, then this buying of people, horse-trading and all these shenanigans will stop. We should take off our political hat and think of the future of India. You cannot have a future that is bright when you have a party in power at the Centre destroying constitutionally elected governments in this completely amoral fashion. The other grave concern I have is (regarding) the investigating agencies, whether it is the NIA, CBI or Enforcement Directorate. These have by and large become tools in the hands of the dispensation which is in power.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

While, prices of beans and carrots have come down in the last two weeks, cost of tomatoes and cabbage has increased considerably.Tomatoes, that used to cost Rs 55 per kg at Hopcoms and Rs 20 per kg at wholesale markets, are now available at Rs 72 per kg and at Rs 50, respectively. Similarly, cabbage, which was earlier available at Rs 28-30 per kg, is now priced at Rs 40. The vegetable prices have been increasing since a month and the trend is likely to continue if the state does not receive sufficient rains. The yield of tomato has dipped, said Gopi.KR Market Traders' Association president G M Diwakar said that every year, the prices increase during May, June and July. Barring potatoes and onions, the prices of all vegetables fluctuate in these three months. Even if it rains, it will take time for the prices to come down.Meanwhile, it is the consumers who are at the receiving end. Sujatha A, a resident of Nagawara, said that she has minimised the use of mint leaves, tomatoes and coriander in the last few days.While at wholesale markets like Kalasipalyam and KR Market, the prices are considerably low, at retail stores, the prices are very high.VEGETABLE/GREENS May 23 JUNE 6Coriander leaves Rs 89 Rs 105Mint leaves Rs 84 Rs 108Chakota greens Rs 27 Rs 50Menthya greens Rs 92 Rs 102Sabakki greens Rs 98 Rs 108Tomato Rs 55 Rs 72Cabbage Rs 28 Rs 40Price per kilo (Source: Hopcoms website)"

This has resulted in retailers treading a cautious path by avoiding excess buying fearing losses as consumers tend to think twice before spending. Few weeks back, only tomatoes witnessed a steep hike in prices, but now, other vegetables, especially those grown in hill stations, have seen a surge in pricing.At present, locally-grown vegetables have come as the only consolation for residents as prices have not changed much. However, they are also set to increase due to the muhurtham days that are lined up in the next couple of months. ""Many vegetables are off the shelves due to price rise. I am left with no option but to purchase whatever is available since I cannot go to markets regularly,"" said Malathi Ranganathan, a homemaker from Anupanadi.Local vegetables such as bottle gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, snake gourd, ridge gourd and banana are sold at normal price. But vegetables such as beans, butter beans, beetroot, green peas, turnip and cabbage have increased manifold in the last couple of weeks. While the price of beans has touched Rs 80 per kg, butter beans and green peas are being sold at Rs 130 and Rs 120 per kg respectively. The price of tomato still hovers at around Rs 80 a kg.However, there is not much difference in the prices of onion, carrot and potato either. While onions are continued to be sold at Rs 15 a kg, carrot and potato are sold at Rs 30 a kg.Traders blame the increase in price to the decreasing supply. They say that vegetable prices would only go up and there will not be any respite in the days to come. ""Reduction in prices can be expected only after a couple of months since there are many muhurtham days until and the demand increases during that time,"" said P Thiagarajan, a vegetable trader in Mattuthavani central market.People from agriculture department attribute the price rise to lower production of vegetables due to untimely rain. K Arumugam, agriculture officer, in-charge of Chockikulam farmers' market said the unseasonal rains had resulted in poor production of vegetables grown in hill stations."

Fruits too were expensive, with Nendran and Rasa Kadali varieties of bananas selling for Rs.62.The supply of local vegetables from the Vellayani area was almost negligible, he said.At a Horticorp stall at DPI where 30 per cent subsidy is available on 15 vegetables, ladys finger cost Rs.24, bitter gourd Rs.60, long beans Rs.80, Indian cucumber Rs.20, tomato Rs.56, and cabbage Rs.28.

Kannauj has nearly 10 hectares of agricultural land, where roses are grown.In the district, there are two categories of farmers, one who cultivate rose shrubs exclusively in their plots and have made it their main occupation, while others grow rose bushes in their agricultural lands for extra income.""We have instructed the horticulture depart to prepare a list of farmers interested in learning advanced techonology in rose cultivation. The agriculture department will bear all the expenses. We will assure farmers there is a good return and encourage them to undergo training in Etah and Hathras districts from where rose buds are being currently supplied to local 'attar' manufacturers,"" the district horticulture officer said.Training and pruning of crop is one of the most important practices which influence flower production significantly.""In roses, this practice will be recommended from mid-December to mid-January in which farmers can get good yield. In the district, there are few, who have adopted an innovative practice of 'alternate year pruning'. In this practice, the crop is trained and pruned one year and kept unpruned in second year. Through this practice, second year crop gives higher number of branches and flowers,"" deputy director, agriculture, Rajesh Kumar said.This technology is cost effective and more remunerative in areas like Kannauj, where distillation of flowers is commercially done for extracting essence and its marketing. The farmers could save the money and increase his profit, he added.""Also, we will increase the area under rose cultivation which at present is 10 hectare. The aim is also to introduce diversity in agriculture so that farmers can choose from value crop instead of usual cash crops like paddy, wheat, potato or jowar,"" another officer of the agriculture department said."

Last month, inflation as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) was at 0.34 per cent, its first gain in 18 months, according to data released by the Centre.The acceleration in WPI, coming as it does after a quickening of retail inflation in the same month, makes it even more unlikely that the Reserve Bank of India will cut interest rates shortly, according to economists.Retail syncThe WPI rose due to food inflation which shot up to 7.9 per cent from 4.2 per cent in April. The same trend could be seen in retail inflation as well where only the food category accelerated inflation.Inflation at the wholesale level rose in sync with trends witnessed in the retail print, Richa Gupta, Senior Economist, Deloitte said.Food continued to push the headline print higher while the effect of rising global commodity prices was also larger in the index due to its close correlation with domestic prices. Vegetable prices rose to take inflation in the category into double digits with potato prices rising by 21.54 per cent, Ms.Gupta said.Within the primary articles basket, while food inflation accelerated, non-food inflation eased considerably in May to 4.5 per cent from 7.1 per cent in April.Supply side responsePolicymakers need to check and address through supply-side responses, the continuous rise in prices of commodities like pulses, food articles, cereals, wheat and other items of national interest , said D.S. Rawat, Secretary General, The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry, India.The fuel and power segment in the WPI contracted 6.1 per cent in May compared to a contraction of 4.8 per cent in April. This was led bythe mineral oil segment, which contracted 9.6 per cent in May compared to a contraction of 7.9 per cent in the earlier month.Manufactured goodsInflation in manufactured goods rose marginally to 0.9 per cent in May from 0.7 per cent in April.Manufacturing inflation is unlikely to be a cause of concern as weak demand across the globe is likely to keep prices subdued, Ms Gupta said.Mr.Rawat said the WPI figures may give some relief to manufacturers and producers since earlier it was hampering their pricing power, profitability and limiting their potential to increase capital expenditure.Worrying trendOverall, the view is that rising inflation coupled with poor industrial growth is a worrying trend. The declining trend in index of industrial production (IIP) and rising WPI may have a negative impact on the countrys economy in the long run, Mr. Rawat said.Overall, the view is that rising inflation coupled with poor industrial growth is a worrying trend"

Prices of several vegetables have gone up by 13% to 66% in the retail market in the last one month.A fall in supply due to water shortage has pushed up the prices. Nashik also supplies large quantities of vegetables to Mumbai, which also has an effect on the supply in the city.The overall rise in vegetable prices has worried citizens, who are struggling to manage their expenses. Weekly household budgets have increased by 60 to 70%.Ramesh Barkale, a farmer who sells his vegetables at Nashik APMC, said, ""There is already a drought in the district and monsoon has also been delayed. This has affected the vegetable supply, leading to rise in prices. The shortage of vegetables is expected to continue for one to two months. The prices will also remain at the same level.""Vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, cabbage, okra, ridge gourd and potato have become costlier in the retail market, but prices of coriander, spinach ( palak) and fenugreek ( methi) are stable and have not shown an increase.Chillies, on the other hand, have become cheaper by around 28%, with the retail price falling from Rs 70 per kg last month to Rs 50 per kg this month.The price rise has affected household budgets, with many people tweaking their diet to meet expenses.Sonali Khairnar, a homemaker, said, ""The vegetable prices have increased a lot in the last three four weeks. It has really become difficult to meet expenses. Instead of vegetables, I have been cooking dishes like pithla and paratha.""Despite the overall increase in vegetable prices, the onion has become cheaper and is being sold at Rs 10-12 per kg in Nashik's retail markets. The retail price of onions had touched Rs 80 per kg in Nashik and Rs 100 per kg in Mumbai, Delhi and other metro cities in August last year.

Mamata's support is important because the BJP doesn't have the numbers to ensure the safe passage of the Bill in the Rajya Sabha.According to experts, the switch-over from VAT (value added tax) to GST is likely to benefit consuming states like West Bengal more than producing states such as Gujarat. Mitra has been holding a series of meetings with the state finance ministers to arrive at a golden mean. One of the major issues coming in the way of a seamless rollout of the GST is the proposed 1% extra GST on producing states. The Congress has opposed it as the proposal has come from Gujarat. Besides, there are other issues like some states have demanded that percentage of revenue-neutral rate of GST should be put into amendment.Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and state FM Amit Mitra will be pushing hard for a consensus by bringing in some amendments over the tax proposal to reach a consensus to marry the polarities between states and political parties. Other than the economic considerations, GST has also become a political hot potato with the Narendra Modi government trying to gain confidence of the India Inc through this major tax reform. On Tuesday, Mitra will be placing the seventh GST draft in the meeting where as many as 20 state finance ministers will be present. When contacted, state FM and chairman of GST panel, Amit Mitra said, ""With Mamata Banerjee taking charge for the second term, such a national event on a significant reform agenda in city makes us proud.""With the Bengal chief minister taking a lead role among states to introduce GST, Kolkata has been chosen the venue of the meeting. This is the first time that a national-level tax reform meeting is being held in the city, a state official said. Even the VAT panel led by former state finance minister Asim Dasgupta didn't ever have a meeting in Kolkata.While giving a push to the GST initiative at the meeting of the chambers, the Bengal chief minister held that the micro, small and medium industrial units in Bengal will gain out of the unified tax procedure, bringing relief to a whole lot of people engaged in this sector."

Some of them had already left their homes in the city for the airport. They grew restless when the flight did not arrive even at 8.15 a.m. The staff member at the AI ticket counter seemed clueless and directed them to find out from the information being given on the CCTV at the airport entry/exit gates.The CCTV screen at the exit gate was only showing that AI 952 as delayed without mentioning the possible arrival time. After persistent enquiries, a hand-written board was put up at the counter indicating that the flight would arrive at 8.30 a.m. But even that did not happen and the CCTV screen continued to show it as delayed.The waiting relatives wondered about the possible reasons for the delay of the AI flight. Could it be due to rain in Hyderabad? They realised that their fears were unfounded as another relative from Hyderabad came by the SpiceJet flight from Hyderabad at 8.30 a.m.Finally, the AI 952 arrived around 9 a.m. after a one-and-a-half hours delay. The worst part was the lack of information from the AI authorities on the reason for the delay and updating the information about the delay at frequent intervals.The Volvo bus, operated by SpiceJet to ferry air passengers from the tarmac to the terminal building at the airport, gave jitters to the passengers a few weeks ago, according to R.V.K. Koteswara Rao, who came from Hyderabad.The driver applied the brakes all of a sudden and a young woman, with a kid in her arms, lost balance and fell. A senior citizen, who was sitting on the last seat, fell from his seat. Luckily, no one sustained major injuries and ironically, they were not even prepared to complain.I complained to the SpiceJet staff member at the counter but she coolly told me: Sir, please call on the customer care number, says Mr. Koteswara Rao.Dr. Pradeep, who had travelled by the II AC coach in the Visakhapatnam-Kollam weekly express, on May 26, was perturbed by the collection of variable rates from passengers for food by the supplier.The supplier had charged Rs.70 for the rice, potato curry, sambar and curd from a woman passenger. He had taken Rs.170 for the same menu from another passenger.Though the coach was clean, the water in the toilet ran out in about an hour after the train started from Visakhapatnam. The woman passenger was shocked when the stall keeper on the platform at Vijayawada, charged Rs.40 for a packet of chips and a 1-litre water bottle, which normally would cost not more than Rs.25. When she pulled him up, he returned an additional Rs.10."

The prices of several vegetables like tomato and lady fingers are about to touch Rs 50 a kilo in the wholesale market, while they will retail for between Rs 80 and Rs 100.""This year, because of the heatwaves, vegetable production has been hit and this has resulted in the increased prices. Supply of the vegetable is already low and hence prices are rising steadily,"" said Deepak Patel of the agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Patel said that this year, due to the excessive heat, there flowering was affected and this has led to a shortage in vegetables supply of about 20% to 25%.He said that prices are likely to stabilize after the arrival of fresh vegetables once the monsoon sets in.Nareshbhai Baghwani, a vegetable trader in Panchvati said: ""The rise in price was extremely sudden. Only last evening I was selling tomatoes for Rs 60 a kg. When I went to buy a fresh stock this morning, they had jacked up the price to Rs 70 per kg, compelling me to raise prices as well.I suppose the reason for the increase is that most crops have failed due the heat. I have to discard almost 3 or 4 kg of every 10 kg because of quality problems.""Laccharam Jagaji, a vegetable trader in Vastrapur says, ""We sell at very close to wholesale prices, which are 60/kg. Raising prices will only drive our customers away, so we aren't raising them unnecessarily. We get our produce from Jamalpur. Demand is greater than supply which is causing prices to rise at Jamalpur too,"" he said.Kishan Paliwal, a cook working in Satellite and Manekbaug areas said: ""Most of the people I work for have asked me to use the bare minimum of tomatoes in my cooking. People have also started adding potatoes to their vegetable preparations. For example, I was asked to add a couple of potatoes in my lady finger dish.""Shital Patel said she had started using fewer tomatoes in gravies, and the red vegetable has totally disappeared from her salad platter. She said that with prices shooting up, she was using one tomato in her gravy where she earlier used three."

Acute shortage in supply due to dry spells across the country has led to the rates of tomatoes boil to Rs80 a kg. Although it is much less than the record high of over Rs120/kg during 2014, traders predict further increase in the days to come. There may be no respite till the winters. Chillies too are hot on the trail of tomatoes, with rates in the range of Rs80 to 120 a kg, in retail market.As summers make the vegetable prices go up, rates of some items are higher than those of the tomato. For example beans, tinda (apple gourd) brinjal and methi (fenugreek) are in being quoted at Rs120 a kg. Traders say rates of other vegetables are up due to the cyclical high reached in summers. Tomato rates have gone up beyond the normal range, touching double the last summer's level. Other veggies are priced in the range of 60 on an average. The cheapest are onions and potatoes at Rs15 to 25 a kg respectively.In the normal course, markets in Nagpur get their supplies of tomato from Sangamner near Nashik and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The drought has brought down the supplies from the regular centres to a low. Traders have discovered a new supply source at Chomu, 40km away from Jaipur in Rajasthan. Representatives of major dealers in the city are camping at Jaipur to get as much stock as possible.However, the variety is nowhere close to the bright red tomatoes coming from Karnataka which are generally preferred by the consumers. The Chomu variety has a yellowish tinge and a sour taste. Due to the interior quality, it is available at Rs60 a kg, but traders do not rule out another increase.Abdul Sattar of M/s A Jabbar and Co at Cotton Market says that in the last summer, the wholesale rates of tomato were within Rs25 a kg. This year, it has nearly doubled. Though the local supply dries up in summer, it is compensated by that from Karnataka and Sangamner. However, this, year even these two sources could not meet the demand due to the drought. Finally, local traders have discovered a source in Rajasthan.Suresh Javade, also a dealer at Cotton Market, said 5-6 kg has to be sorted out due to inferior quality from a crate of 25kg which makes the tomato prices in the retail market almost double.""The situation will continue until October when the local supply of tomatoes will begin. Now, even traders in the South are depending on Nagpur to route the Chomu variety for meeting the demand there,"" said Manubhai, a trader now camping at Jaipur.It has been the same for chillies also. The wholesale rates have gone up to Rs40 a kg, though it was double over a week ago. Again, the local supplies were reduced to a negligible level. Finallym the commodity is now being sourced from Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, which has helped in easing the rates, said Sattar."

The price of tomato has shot up to Rs 70 per kg.The tomato is not cultivated in the district in a large scale to meet the demand of the district. As a result, the merchants purchase tomatoes from outside the district. This is also one of the reason for rise in price of tomatoes, said one of the consumer.The price of tomato has been raising since the last 20 days. From Rs 40 per kg, the price has increased to Rs 50 per kg and Rs 70 per kg. The price of beans (Rs 60 per kg), cauliflower (Rs 60 per kg), green peas (Rs 160 per kg), carrot (Rs 60 per kg), okra (Rs 40 per kg), capsicum (Rs 80 per kg), potato (Rs 40 per kg) too have increased. The prices of methi, pudina, corriander leaves and sabsige too have doubled.APMC Secretary Chandrashekar said, Owing to lack of rainfall, the tomato production has declined in the last three months. As a result, the arrival of vegetables to the APMC has reduced drastically. The onions arrive from plateau and Maharashtra and accordingly, the price of onions are under control.Lakhya, Sakharayapattana, Kadur, Kalasapura, Ambale where tomato, beans and other vegetables are grown in the district faced 1acute shortage of water in the last three months. This had an affect on the cultivation of vegetables. The region has been receiving rainfall in the last few weeks and the farmers have started cultivating vegetables. The harvest will reach within a month, said APMC former president S T Chandre Gowda.The price of vegetables have increased drastically. Instead of vegetables it is better to purchase one kg of chicken, said Jagadish, a resident of Market Road.The price of green chillies were Rs 100 to Rs 120 last week. However, the chillies have started coming to the markets in Chikkamagaluru from Hassan, Arakalagoodu, and Ramanathapura. As a result, the prices have come down to Rs 40 per kg this week, said vegetable vendor Jafar Saab."

In the span of just two weeks, the prices rose to Rs 60 in Rythu Bazars.""Vizag daily gets tomatoes in seven lorries of 16-tonne capacity from Madanapalli. But now, we are receiving two lorries. This apart, 20% to 25% of the tomatoes were damaged. The situation will continue for the next one or two weeks till we get our local product,"" Prasad said.Another official from the Visakhapatnam city marketing department said unlike potato and onion, tomatoes have a short shelf life. ""The absence of adequate cold storage facilities in the supply chain has aggravated the problem,"" the officer said.However, as an alternative, the department is procuring hybrid tomatoes from Bangalore, but most of the people are not buying it due to the difference in taste, the marketing officer added."

Venkaiah Naidu (Parliamentary Affairs) plunged into damage control exercise, chalking out a roadmap and stringent measures to bring down the prices.The high-powered ministerial panel met on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as growing prices of essential item like potatoes (60 per cent dearer in wholesale markets) and pulses getting costlier by 36 per cent over the past year, pushed up India's annual wholesale inflation for the second month in May to its highest levels in nearly two years.""Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu were not part of the original ministerial team set up recently. But today they attended the meeting as special emissaries of the Prime Minister,"" a source said.""In order to bring down the growing prices of pulses, the government today decided to boost imports via public and private agencies. This will help meet the deficit,"" an official source told IANS.The government is also keen to work out joint strategies with states and sought urgent steps on adequate procurement and actions against hoarders. The meeting, also attended by senior officials from the Food, Finance and Agriculture ministries, reviewed steps taken so far on inadequate storage facilities and procurement problems.The procurement of Rabi (winter) pulses has reached to 64,000 MT while the government has also ordered further import of 12,500 MT pulses for buffer stocks. A ministry source said that together with earlier procurement of 51,000 MT of kharif (summer) crop, total domestic procurement of pulses by June 13 had reached 1,15,000 MT.At the meeting, Paswan also said that while a pulse buffer stock is ready, the response from many states has not been encouraging.Besides pulses, the meeting also discussed the price conditions of tomato, sugar and wheat.Sources also said the meeting was also told that as a precautionary measure the government has procured 20,000 tonnes of onion to create a buffer stock to be utilised for market intervention.Earlier in the day, the Food ministry also flagged off mobile vans for selling pulses at reasonable prices in the capital.Paswan told reporters that ""Our department has been asked to procure more pulses for buffer stock"" and added that a team of officials will visit Myanmar soon to ensure early and smooth import of lentils.India's retail inflation also rose for the second straight month in May to 5.76 per cent from 5.47 per cent in the month before due to a sharp spike in food prices, Consumer Price Index (CPI) data said on Monday.--IANSnd/vd"

Traders blame poor supply and the holy month of Ramzan for the sudden hike in prices. Onion is the only commodity which isn't bringing tears to consumers with it being priced Rs 16 per kg.Tomatoes are priced at Rs 65 to Rs 75, beans at Rs 80 to Rs 125, lady's finger Rs 60, cabbage Rs 40 and potatoes Rs 26 to Rs 31. Merchants say excessive rain damaging crops in some parts and dry spell in other parts is the reason behind this price hike.Central Market merchant David D'Souza says: The prices of many vegetables have gone up though not many functions are happening due to excessive rains in Chikkamagaluru which has resulted in crop loss.The price of tomato which was Rs 40 per kg last month has gone up to Rs 65 to Rs 75 in the retail outlets.The price of beans varies across retail and super markets. While the wholesale rate of beans are at Rs 80, its retailing at Rs 90 to Rs 125 depending upon the place from where the beans are purchased.Hoteliers are also a worried lot. ""We don't have any other option than to accept it like we do when there is a seasonal variation,'' a hotelier averred. Homemaker Sunitha from Valencia said, ""Looking at the prices of vegetables and fruits I now buy them in small quantities. Though it means that I have to visit the stores twice or thrice a week, but it does not pinch that much when small quantities are consumed without getting wasted.Fruits have seen a significant rise in prices by at least 25%.

113,Agriculture Reform: Breaking the trader cartel,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agriculture-reform-breaking-the-trader-cartel-2855435/,2016-06-16,Indian Express,"The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar) The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar)Spread over 70 hectares land off the Old Mumbai-Pune highway, its a place where more than Rs 10,000 crore worth of fruits, vegetables and other farm produce gets traded annually. But right now, its also the scene of a prabodhan, a mass awakening campaign by traders and commission agents that could gather pace in the days ahead.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Vashi, barely 35 km from the main Mumbai city, is one of Maharashtras 305 regulated mandis where produce is first traded before being taken for consumption elsewhere. While the smallest of these may have a yearly turnover of below Rs 25 lakh, the Vashi APMC is the largest and also a terminal market receiving daily over 2,000 trucks that ferry produce from both within and outside Maharashtra. Last year alone, this mandi saw arrivals of 8,93,444 tonnes of onions and potatoes, 5,64,056 tonnes of other vegetables and 6,63,831 tonnes of fruits.Currently, though, a single factor is uniting the market players operating in regulated mandis across Maharashtra irrespective of size: The state governments move to delist fruits and vegetables (F&V) from the purview of the APMC Act. This, if it happens as was done by the Delhi government in September 2014, would dispense with the requirement for all F&V to be brought to mandis and sold through licensed market agents charging commission fees. Such fees in the Vashi APMC amount to 6.5 per cent of the purchase price of onions and potatoes, 8 per cent for other vegetables and 10 per cent for fruits.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe notification delisting F&V will be issued in the next few days. The issue has been pending since long and we have decided to go ahead taking into account the interest of farmers, said Chandrakant Patil, Maharashtras minister for cooperation.This isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview. A final decision, however, could not be taken following strong trader protests.The possibility of the reform going through is seen to be higher under the present BJP-Shiv Sena dispensation. A major reason for it is that the APMCs  like sugar and various other rural-based cooperatives  are largely controlled by the NCP and Congress. The ruling alliance partners have little presence in APMC boards that are supposed to have elected directors representing all stakeholders, including farmers, traders and mandi labourers. The Vashi APMC is now under a state government-appointed administrator, with the earlier board of directors superseded for alleged malpractices.The total turnover of APMCs in Maharashtra is roughly Rs 50,000 crore. Delisting of F&V may bring this down by Rs 10,000 crore. But even this neednt be the case, as we have seen in Delhi, where business at Azadpur mandi has not suffered after delisting. We are only giving farmers an option, which includes supplying directly to processors or supermarkets. Theres nothing stopping them from continuing to sell through APMCs, pointed out Patil.F&V contribute over Rs 3,000 crore to the Vashi APMCs yearly turnover of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore.APMCs were originally established with a view to prevent exploitation of farmers by intermediaries, who compelled them to dispose of their produce at the farmgate at very low prices. By mandating all farm produce to be brought to regulated market yards and sold through auctions, the APMC mechanism was meant to ensure fair prices to farmers. But in many cases, these bodies have themselves become dens for cartelisation by traders, who control prices and charge hefty commission fees on produce transactions.An extreme case that surfaced recently was of Devidas Maruti Parbhane. This farmer from Vadgaon Rasai, a village in Pune districts Shirur taluka, supplied one tonne of onions early this month at the local market yard under the Pune APMCs jurisdiction. The price he got  a little more than Rs 1.5 per kg  was itself very low. But adding insult to injury was the various cuts imposed on top of this.A scrutiny of Parbhanes patti (trade slip) by The Indian Express revealed his total revenues from the sale of one tonne of onions at Rs 1,523.20. The total cuts even on this meager amount added up to Rs 1,522.20. That included commission fees of Rs 91.30, hamali or labour charges of Rs 59, bharai or filling-in-bags charges of Rs 18.55, tolai or loading charges of Rs 33.30, and transport charges of Rs 1,320 (as the kutcha patti issued in Shirur was billed for delivery at Pune). Parbhane, at the end of it, was left with a net earning of Re 1: When after the auction, the trader handed me a Re 1 coin, I was flabbergasted. Maybe, he should not have taken the trouble to pay me even that!Traders, however, dismiss these as one-off incidents, while claiming that delisting of F&V would ultimately hurt even farmers. The produce brought by farmers is not uniform, which is what processors want. The APMCs are tuned to handle variety. Here, we have 50-55 varieties of vegetables and 25-30 varieties of fruits arriving on a daily basis. Such variety will disappear once delisting happens. Moreover, instead of a centralised marketplace, youll have small and medium vehicles carrying farm produce and creating traffic mayhem in Mumbai, warned Rajendra Shelke, a leading onion and potato commission agent at the Vashi APMC.Besides, the APMC system guarantees that the farmer is paid for his produce, which wouldnt be the case if he were to sell directly? The proposed reform looks good on paper, but it will only spell doom for the farmer and end up completely destroying the agrarian economy, he added.Sanjay Pansare, who represents traders at the Vashi APMCs fruit market, justified the high commission rates on grounds that the goods being handled here were perishable and prone to quality deterioration. Only around a quarter of the produce brought to the market is eventually of the best quality; the rest falls between medium and bad. The losses borne by traders on this count have to, therefore, be made up through higher commission fees. Since 2002, the Maharashtra government has been issuing marketing licenses to various entities for procuring directly from the farmgate. Besides, 34 private markets have been allowed to be set up. But despite this, an estimated 75 per cent of annual arrivals of F&V in the state still take place in APMCs. The proportions are lower at 46 per cent for cotton and 25-30 per cent in oilseeds and foodgrains.Delisting F&V from the purview of the APMC ActThis isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform.

This is a part of government strategy to create buffer stock through central agencies like Nafed under Price Stability Funds (PSF) to stabilise onion prices in domestic market in case of scarcity of onions, which are expected for a period of three months from August to October.Speaking to TOI, a Nafed official said, ""Last year, we could procure only 2,500 tonnes of onions under PSF due to lack of storage capacity. This year, we increased the capacity of the existing storage centres, besides getting storage facilities on lease. We have decided to increase onion procurements under PSF gradually every year.""The official said, ""We have procured 4,500 tonnes of onions so far at three APMCs - Lasalgaon, Kalwan and Pimpalgaon. Onion procurements have been closed at Kalwan and Pimpalgaon, while we will procure the remaining 500 tonnes at Lasalgaon by the weekend.""Of the 4,500 tonnes of onions, 2,000 tonnes each have been procured at Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon, while 500 tonnes have been procured at Kalwan APMC. In 2015-16, the government introduced the PSF for onions, potatoes and other crops with provision of Rs 500 crore in the budget. Last year, the government had created a buffer stock of 12,000 tonnes through central agencies like Nafed and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium. But the scarcity had compelled the government to import 10,000 tonnes to meet domestic needs."
115,"Triple whammy as dal, tomato & potato prices surge together",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Triple-whammy-as-dal-tomato-potato-prices-surge-together/articleshow/52787764.cms,2016-06-17,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: The cause for consumers' tears, this summer, is not the price of onions.It's the triple whammy of a huge increase in the cost of tomatoes, potatoes, arhar dal and urad dal - all staple foods. It hasn't helped that the government's efforts to build stocks of dals, has been either absent or ineffective.Arhar dal now costs as much as Rs 170/kg. Urad dal is selling for as high as Rs 196/kg. Tomatoes are going for Rs 100 a kg. And potato prices are up to almost Rs 20/kg.Dal production has been hit due to last year's drought, almost doubling its prices. Higher-than-expected heat has destroyed some tomato crop, which may have constricted its supply, pushing And a blight that swept across potato fields in Bengal, has hit the tuber's supply.The situation is so bad that vegetable price inflation rose 2.21 percent to 12.94%. That then badly hit the Wholesale Price Index, pushing it to 0.79% in May, its highest level in 19 months. And with no change in the already high inflation in the price of dals - at 35.56 percent - food inflation on the whole spiked to 7.88% in May from 4.23% a month earlier.The government's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of dals - or pulses - for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said. He added that rabi crop procurement is still going on, he added.India imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.In the last two years, arhar dal prices have doubled and the cost of urad has increased by around 120%. Even the price of chana dal, which is produced in large quantities and is usually unaffected by inflation, has risen 85% in this period, in Delhi.The case of the two staple vegetables - potatoes and tomatoes - is slightly different. Both are shorter duration crops. But both have seen prices surge.Tomatoes are ripe for harvesting 60-70 days after transplanting while potatoes take 75-120 days to mature. The tomatoes that are coming to the market now were planted around March. While there were some unusually high temperatures in that period, the crop destruction was not staggering.Winter rain in the larger producing states was not unduly distressing, either. In any case, tomato farming isn't completely dependent on rain. So the agriculture ministry's second advanced estimates for horticultural crops pegged the tomato crop for 2015-16 at 18.2 million metric tonne, up from the previous year's 16.4 million metric tonne.And still, tomato prices have gone through the roof. Although the government says that prices are not so high, data published by the department of consumer affairs and the National Horticulture Board show that in most cities, prices have increased by 100-200% between April and June this year. A comparison of prices between June 2014 and June 2016 shows that in most cities, tomato prices have increased phenomenally.The potato economy is different from the tomato one, in that it's not based just on supply and demand. A portion of each year's harvest of potatoes goes into cold storages across the country and comes out for the market later Potato production was estimated to dip this year to about 46 million tonnes from the previous year's 48 million tonnes. The blight in Bengal destroyed some potato crop, pushing its price up.(Edited by Shailaja Neelakantan)"

Our deparment was told to procure more pulses for buffer stock,"" food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.This year's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of pulses for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, while the rabi procurement is still going on, he added.To boost domestic supply, Paswan said, ""The finance minister also said that imports via public and private agencies should be strengthened to meet the deficit.""The government has decided to send a team immediately to pulses-growing nations like Myanmar and Africa to explore government-to-government imports, the food minister said.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as chief economic adviser, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also envinced interest to supply lentils to India.Besides pulses,, sugar and wheat was also discussed at the meeting.Tomato prices have more than doubled to rule as high as Rs 100 per kg due to crop damage. Potato prices have also been on the rise.Paswan informed in the meeting that the price rise in tomato was a ""seasonal"" factor and the commodity cannot be stored due to short shelf-life unlike wheat and rice.He also informed that his ministry is keeping a close watch on prices of pulses, sugar, wheat, tomato and other essential food items.The country had imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.The ministers discussed the progress made in imports of pulses as well as reviewed the buffer stocks position and lifting by state governments for retail distribution at subsidised rates.The government has procured 1.15 lakh tonnes pulses directly from farmers as of now for creating a buffer stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes this year. It is also importing pulses through state-owned trading agencies like MMTC. So far, 38,500 tonnes of lentils have been contracted for import.The wholesale price inflation data released on Tuesday showed vegetable prices rising sharply to 12.94 per cent. Pulses inflation has remained in double digits since January 2015 and stood at 35.56 per cent in May.The meeting also discussed ways to better procurement, and increase in sowing area, taking action against hoarders, and improve transparency in functioning of private importers.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as Chief Economic Advisor, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also evinced interest to supply lentils to India.Despite several measures, pulses are still ruling high at over Rs 170 per kg in most parts of the country due to a widening demand-supply gap following two successive droughts.Paswan, who launched sale of tur and urad at a subsidised Rs 120 per kg through mobile vans of co-operative NCCF in the national capital today, said: ""If prices rise despite this move, the Centre is not responsible. In a federal structure, states have equal responsibility in controlling prices.""Passage of the GST Bill and creation of the national common agriculture market would address the price rise issue to a large extent, he hoped.The National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) is the third player after Mother Dairy's Safal and Kendriya Bhandar that will be selling tur and urad at the subsidised rate in the national capital.Asserting that the Centre is ""serious"" about the price rise issue, Paswan said, ""We have created a buffer stock and have asked states to place their requirement for retail distribution. However, not many states have shown interest.""The Centre is offering to state governments the un-milled tur and urad from the buffer stock at Rs 66 per kg for retail distribution at not more than Rs 120 in order to provide relief to consumers."

Telegraph pictureImphal, June 17: People in the Manipur valley have stopped supply of essential commodities to the five hill districts to counter a 10-day economic blockade imposed by tribal organisations in the hills. Vehicles leaving Imphal are being regularly checked by valley people since Tuesday to stop transportation of essential commodities to the hills. If rice, potato or any other edible item is found in the vehicles, it is being unloaded. However, those accompanying the goods are allowed to proceed. People turned up along Imphal-Churachandpur, Imphal- Ukhrul, Imphal-Tamenglong, Imphal-Senapati and Imphal-Chandel routes to enforce the counter-blockade. Several hill-based indigenous groups had imposed a 10-day economic blockade on the state's lifelines - National Highway 2 (Imphal-Dimapur highway) and National Highway 37 (Imphal-Silchar highway) - on June 9 midnight, disrupting supply of commodities to Manipur. The blockade was called jointly by the Joint Action Committee against Anti-Tribal Bills, Hmar Inpui, Mizo Peoples Convention, Thadou Inpi, United Naga Council, Zoumi Council and the Outer Manipur Tribal Forum against the Protection of Manipur People Bill 2015, Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms (Seventh Amendment) Bill 2015 and the Manipur Shops and Establishments (Second Amendment) Bill 2015, which were passed by the Manipur Assembly in August last year. The bills are awaiting the President's assent. The Okram Ibobi Singh government has so far brought loaded trucks, stranded at various points in Senapati district, to Imphal with police escorts twice since the blockade began. To counter the blockade, people in the valley stopped commodities moving towards the five hill districts at various places in Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal and Bishnupur districts - all in the valley. ""We are checking vehicles going towards Ukhrul. We unload if commercial items are found in the vehicles and allow the people to proceed. We told the owner of the goods that they can come back and collect the unloaded goods after the 10-day blockade imposed by tribal organisations is over,"" a counter-blockade supporter said. Sources said the counter-blockade was launched after prices of essential commodities, including vegetables, soared after the economic blockade was imposed. An independent researcher said the price of potato had increased from Rs 25 to Rs 35 in Imphal city. The prices of other edible items have also increased, ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 40. Unlike in the past, consumers are not facing any scarcity of fuel as all the pumps are open this time. In the earlier blockades, some of the pumps were closed while others witnessed long queues. ""The IOC is releasing adequate petrol and fuel this time. Therefore, there is no problem of fuel this time,"" a petrol pump owner said."

Tur dal prices hit Rs 150 per kilogram, while prices of urad dal crossed the Rs 150 mark in the wholesale market on Friday.Tur dal prices hit Rs 150 per kilogram, while prices of urad dal crossed the Rs 150 mark in the wholesale market on Friday leaving the state administration worried.Officials from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Vashi said the price of urad per kilogram had risen to Rs 158. Its true that urad dal price has shot up this week. The rates of all pulses have risen by at least Rs 5. And, it is likely to increase further in coming weeks, said an official adding that tur dal price per kilogramme on Friday was around Rs 140.However, price in the retail market was more than Rs 200 per kilogramme, admitted the official, adding that shortage of pulses has led to a rise in prices. Another official said vegetables too are witnessing a shortage and rise in prices. The supply of vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, potato is deficient. As a result, average price of vegetables has shot up to Rs 30-50 per kilogramme now, said the official adding the prices were between Rs 10 and Rs 30 per kilogramme in April. The vegetable prices are also likely to increase further, he said.Watch Video: Whats making newsOfficials attributed the shortage of pulses and vegetables to the drought resulting in low production across the state. While weather officials projected a good monsoon this year, its onset has been delayed.In the cabinet meeting earlier this week, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis directed the authorities to step up efforts to boost supply and check hoarding. A report tabled in the cabinet meeting stated that retail prices of vegetables have seen a 21-28 per cent jump in the past week.Fadnavis has directed Food and Civil Supplies Minister Girish Bapat to rush to Delhi to convince the union government to okay a higher buffer stock of tur dal for the state. While the Maharashtra government had raised a demand that the Centre should release 20,000 metric tonnes of tur dal for the state, sources said the Centre has so far agreed to release just 700 metric tonnes. Bapat proposed that the state government should import tur dal. The state administration is not entirely in favour of the proposal.

Srinivasa Rao of Visakhapatnam, who came from Tadepalligudem to the city by the AP AC Express on Sunday evening. He has sent a picture of two simians rummaging through the wastes, thrown right on the platform at Tadepalligudem, captured on his mobile phone.Coming to the AP AC Express, the train and the running were good but it stopped at many places en route. It was stopped at Duvvada Railway Station for about 15 minutes to give way to another Super fast Express. Finally, our train reached Visakhapatnam at 7.30 p.m., 45 minutes behind schedule, says Mr. Srinivasa Rao.The normal fare from Tadepalligudem to Vizag on this train was Rs.540. I had booked my ticket, three days prior to my journey and the fare was normal. But, my cousin, Balaji was puzzled to note that the Tatkal fare was Rs.1,200, when he tried to book the ticket on Saturday, he says.Dr. Pradeep, who had travelled by the II AC coach in the Visakhapatnam-Kollam weekly express, a few weeks ago, was perturbed by the collection of variable rates from passengers for food by the supplier.There is no pantry car in the long distance train.A woman, who was travelling with her daughter in the same coach, ordered for vegetarian food when the supplier came to take the order.The supplier charged Rs.70 for the rice, potato curry, sambar and curd. Later, she came to know from the passenger, sitting opposite her after his berth was confirmed, that the supplier had taken Rs.170 for the same menu.Though the coach was clean, the water in the toilet ran out in about an hour after the train started from Visakhapatnam. The water was filled in the overhead tank only at Vijayawada Junction.The woman passenger was shocked when the stall keeper on the platform at Vijayawada, charged Rs.40 for a packet of chips and a 1-litre water bottle, which normally would cost not more than Rs.25. When she pulled him up, he returned Rs.10."

Because of their competitive prices and discounts, these online groceries are the current favourites of customers.In fact, according to e-grocery players, there have been a significant rise in sales of tomatoes particularly over the last seven to 10 days ever since the prices spiked. ""We have noticed a sudden surge in sales of basic fruits and vegetables, especially tomatoes, onions, potatoes in the range of 20% to 30%,"" said Rahul Hari, owner and founder, Satvacart.""While tomatoes in the offline market are selling at Rs 70-80 per kg, we have been able to offer rates in the range of Rs 40-Rs 50 a kg,"" he added.K Radhakrishnan, co-founder at GrocerMax, said that there has been a 50% in his sales volume for tomatoes in the last four days itself due to better pricing.Explaining the logic for lesser online prices, Radhakrishnan said he is flexible on the margins to ensure that the customer does not take the hit because of the high prices. ""We might shrink the rupee margin, but the increase in volume covers the cost which makes it a win-win situation,"" he added.However, the models might vary from one player to another. Satvacart, for instance, explains the lower prices due to the price point availability because of the optimised supply chain and cut-down of middlemen in procurement.""Yesterday I was reading about the price hike and then I checked online and found out I was getting half a kilo of tomatoes at just Rs 20,"" said Pooja Garg, a communications professional working with a finance company.However, some suspect the portals are also witnessing heavy traffic as customers get curious and compare prices across portals."

Secondly, it's the state governments which have to get their act together since crackdown on hoarders and fixing stock limits fall under their purview. Third, the measures come mostly as knee-jerk reactions and are not pursued once prices become normal .For example, soon after the NDA government assumed office in 2014, onion prices touched Rs 100 a kg and tomato prices soared. The government planned to create its own storage and had even held talks with scientists for improving the shelf-life of vegetables. The agriculture ministry even mulled the need to go for rotational crops across the country to ensure minimum supply of key kitchen items throughout the year, but in vain.""What we need is a policy and a robust mechanism rather than getting desperate every time prices go up,"" said an official. He said the government should devise a system to keep people informed about availability of items. ""What can be done to increase tomato supply when production is hit because of adverse weather? You can't import them. We must have a good communication strategy.""On Friday, urad was selling at Rs 196/kg and arhar at Rs 166.

A huge gap in the demand and supply of the vegetables has led to this huge increase in prices and homemakers are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain a balance between keeping the daily menus healthy and not letting the budget go haywire. Experts have claimed that for the next one month condition of the vegetable market would remain same. ""Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra are the biggest importers for state from where a major share of vegetables is received. But looking at the present conditions we expecting that the prices would continue to be the same,"" said Arvind Hatia, Executive member, Indore vegetable association.Across the nation, farmers produce has been affected due to adverse weather conditions.Vegetable association claimed that the sowing season has commenced, soybean is emerging the most preferred crops for the farmers in this region. ""Lesser vegetables would be sown this year and major share of vegetables in state is dependent on the imports from other states,"" added Hatia. Sources have claimed that the prices of potatoes might increase in the next one month. ""As the schools have re-opened, kids usually prefer potatoes and okra so we cannot deny the possibility of increase in its cost at the retail market,"" said Mukesh Sharma, a retailer.As the monsoon has commenced but for the harvesting of vegetables minimum 50 days are required. So it is almost difficult to bring down the prices in the next few days. Wholesalers have claimed that till July 20, there won't be any dip in the prices of vegetables. In the past one month prices of vegetables has gone up by almost Rs 40 at the retail market and wholesale market as well.

Under the revised norms, companies with ""cutting edge"" technology would be exempted from the 30% domestic sourcing norm for three years before getting up to five years to meet the requirement.Similarly, Das told TOI, food retailers would automatically invest in creating back-end infrastructure and local processing and supply chain although the government had not mandated any norms while allowing 100% FDI. ""No one is going to import potatoes from Australia but retailers will work with farmers to make their business model viable. It will happen automatically. I expect a strong interest from foreign companies,"" Das said. Food retailers have to mandatorily sell only food which is produced, processed or manufactured in India. The food processing ministry was insisting on mandating investment in back-end infrastructure as one of the conditions for the entry of overseas retailers. Das said that the opening up of this segment of the retail business would help stabilize prices to some extent.Expanding on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement of India being the ""most open"" investment destination, Das said that even some of the advanced countries did not allow 100% FDI in sectors such as airlines.Further, he said that domestic players did not have to fear foreign competition as they were robust enough to take them on globally. ""The entry of global food chains has helped our home-grown brands prosper because they have modernised, adapted to competition and improved quality.""Asked about the government's decision to do away with the need for government approval in several cases  from acquisition up to 74% in existing pharma companies to 100% for DTH services and brownfield airports  the economic affairs secretary said the move was part of the exercise to do away with human interface and make it process-driven. He said that nearly 95% of the FDI proposals would not require government approval, as against 90-91% at present. ""Once the budget-related proposals for non-banking finance companies are implemented, FIPB's work load will reduce further,"" he said. The government is looking to do away with the need for government permission for all NBFC activities that are regulated by various regulators."
126,Middlemen elevates vegetable prices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Middlemen-elevates-vegetable-prices/articleshow/52894848.cms,2016-06-24,The Times Of India,"A ladies finger in its journey from the farms to the food plates changes eight pair of hands lurking in the supply chain, each transfer almost doubling up the price due to profit-making by several layers of the aggregators.Despite demand lagging behind the supply, potatoes are selling for over Rs 21 for every kilogram because of hoarding by aggregators.The prices of vegetables have skyrocketed but the reason behind it is not shortage in supply but involvement of several layers of aggregators who lurk in the supply chain and extract their pound of flesh at every stage.Aggregators (or middlemen) are a key cog in the supply chain  each buys in excess of bulk depending on their risk taking capacity to reap the benefits of economies of scale. They survive on margins after paying transportation costs and taking the produce to wholesale markets closer to the city.Prabhat Kumar Das, the organising secretary of the Federation of Traders' Organisation and member of the chief minister's task force on price of edibles, admits that presence of several layers of aggregators in the supply is spiralling up the prices.""In Koley Market which is the biggest wholesale hub for vegetables, there are two to three layers of middlemen. The profit that each aggregator makes gets added to the cost price. The end consumers have to bear the price brunt,"" said Das.To unearth the reason behind the unusual spike in the prices of some vegetables, TOI visited a pocket in Hooghly from where vegetables come to the city through a complex chain of aggregators and wholesalers.Panna Lal Mondal, a small farmer in Baganbati, 60 kilometres from Kolkata, refuses to believe what he just heard.The ladies finger (dharosh) Mondal grows in his six cottahs fetched him only Re 1 per kilogram last week but shoppers in Kolkata are paying between Rs 20 and Rs 24for the same vegetable.""It's unbelievable,"" the 58-year-old farmer exclaimed in dismay, told about the skyrocketing prices in the last-mile markets in the past few weeks.In the neighbouring village of Nalikul, the ribbed gourd that Sujit Samanta harvested in his 11 cottah land has fetched him only Rs 4 per kilogram. In Kolkata, the vegetable is selling for anything between Rs 22 and Rs 26.""When we go to the markets to sell our produce, the middlemen refuse to buy saying that there is no demand in Kolkata. They buy them dirt chap but make a fat profit selling in Kolkata,' said Samanta, 62.If the movement of price from one market to the next is tracked, it is evident that the price tends to double with each change of hands. The uniformity  doubling at each stage  is an intriguing factor as the costs involved at each stage are different.A rise in the price to some extent is inevitable because of the distance and the number of intermediaries involved. But a 1900 per cent spurt (from Re 1 to Rs 20 in case of ladies finger ) suggests profiteering by a section of middlemen who control the supply chain of vegetables from farm to food plates."

Lorries carrying vegetables, fish, fruits and other perishable items have been stranded for more than a week and the consignments have started rotting.""India and Bangladesh already have a treaty on surface transport and transshipment via the latter's waterways. Recently, an iron consignment from Haldia in West Bengal reached Agartala through the Ashuganj port of Bangladesh. The Centre should allow us to start regular movement of goods through the neighbouring country,"" said food and civil supplies minister Bhanu Lal Saha.Tripura had once brought in 10,000 MT of rice from Andhra Pradesh through Bangladesh, Saha recalled and added that if regular transit and transshipment start, the state's dependence on the highway would be reduced.""The prices of onion and potato have increased due to disruption of road communication in south Assam. The administration has reviewed the situation and increased surveillance on the market,"" he added.Meanwhile, irate drivers and assistants of vehicles stranded on either side of Lowerpowa attacked an Assam Police outpost at Churaibari on Thursday. They accused the policemen of harassing them."

Vegetables like tomato and potato are being sold at Rs 60 and Rs 20 per kg while most green vegetables are priced above Rs 40 per kg. Lack of rain has badly affected the local harvest as well as supply from other states, and is the main reason for the price rise, insiders said.""It is nearly a fortnight or more the prices of all vegetables are going over the roofs. It has become really unmanageable to give a balanced diet to children these days as pulses and vegetables have gone beyond the reach of common man,"" said Bandita Kar, a school teacher.At a time when there should be continuous rain a drought-like situation prevails at most parts of the state. ""The rainfall in the second week of June was inadequate for crops and affected cultivation. The situation is similar in other states, leading to a drop in the supply of green vegetables,"" said Sudarshan Sahu, a vegetable vendor in the Unit-I market here.Prices of most vegetables doubled in the last few weeks. Beans are being sold for Rs 100 per kg while drumsticks fetch Rs 140 for every kilo.

Vegetables also come from districts like Jajpur, Kendrapada, Cuttack, Nayagarh, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj and Puri districts.""Odisha is one of the largest producers of green vegetables but due to lack of proper crop management and storage facilities it has to depend on other states for 20% of its vegetable consumption,"" said an officer in the state horticulture department."

Rs 152 crore has been set aside for the food processing and horticulture department, Rs 495 crore for the animal resources development department. Rs 250 crore for the fisheries department, Rs 2,277 crore for the irrigation and waterways, and a whopping Rs 10,653 crore for the panchayat and rural development department. This takes the total budgetary allocation for the rural Bengal to Rs 15,841 crore  the maximum for the Trinamool Congress government since its first came to power in 2011.Watch Video: Whats making newsIn his Budget speech, Mitra had said that in the agriculture and agri-allied sector, a seven-fold increase has been recorded from 2010-11 to 2015-16, with the earnings recording Rs 21,224.61 crore last year.According to the state figures, in agriculture and allied activities, the state claims to have achieved record agricultural production of 174 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of produce in 2015-16. Procurement of food grains has increased and warehousing facilities enhanced from 62,000 MT in 2010-2011 to 5.62 lakh MT in 2015-16  a nine-fold increase. In 2015, 30 lakh flood-affected farmers were provided assistance of Rs 1,025 crore in three months, the minister had said Friday.More than 10,000 kms of rural roads and 10,663 kms of highways were upgraded and constructed. The state has claimed that 100 per cent rural electrification is almost complete under Sabar Ghare Alo scheme.But agrarian activists want the state government to look at the other important issue  suicides of farmers.CPM has claimed in the past that at least 200 farmers in the state have committed suicide in the past three years. Of these, 116 suicides took place in Bardhaman alone.Activists allege that like the Left Front government before it, the TMC government too has refused to accept the states agrarian crisis. The worst affected, they say, have been the rice and potato farmers.Neither government made the markets easily accessible to farmers. The Left Front used to give subsidy to farmers for crop cutting, which was cancelled by the Mamata Banerjee government. The production cost of crops has increased with the increase in prices of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, electricity. There is no water available for the crops either. We hope the outlay announced by the state government (in the Budget) should alleviate the situation to some extent. We are cautiously optimistic, an activist who has been working for the Right to Food said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Many farmers, who cultivated tobacco for decades, have been moving to other crops after a fall in income from tobacco. They find cultivation of potato or maize to be more profitable, given the labour cost and work hours that the commercial crop demands.India is one among the signatories to the UN-framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which mandates phasing out tobacco cultivation by 2020, and the growers here are ready to give it up if they are offered a comprehensive package, besides waiving of loans.Ninge Gowda, a farmer in Belavadi in Arakalgud taluk, said his father started tobacco cultivation in the late 1970s when cigarette manufacturers promoted the crop in the region. In our family, we have three licences. Of them, only one is active now, he said. The Tobacco Board issues licences to the grower, and with each licence, a grower can produce 1,750 kg of tobacco leaves a year. In the last 30 years, the price of tobacco has gone up 10 times, whereas the labour cost has gone up 100 times. Besides that, we have to spend on constructing barns and fuel necessary to dry the leaves, Mr. Ninge Gowda said.Raje Gowda of Kurana Koplu said he had stopped tobacco cultivation for the past two years. With minimum expenses and least labour cost, we get good income from potato or maize. I have borrowed over Rs. 4 lakh to cultivate tobacco. Overburdened with loans, I stopped growing it, he said.Of the 8,000 licence holders in Hassan, nearly 1,000 have stopped cultivating tobacco. S.V. Yoganna, a tobacco grower and Arakalgud taluk, and president of Raitha Sangha, said, Many have stopped cultivating tobacco, and the rest are ready to give up the crop, provided the government gives us a package. How can the Prime Minister give a call for Swachh Bharat all the while allowing tobacco cultivation to continue in farm fields? he added."

Just tap on an app. Two young Ranchi guys with BCA and MBA degrees under their belt from Manipal and Pune are back home to open a start-up selling vegetables and fruits at prices lower than retail markets. Friends from their days at DAV Public School, Hehal, Bariatu boys Ankit Kumar (25), a BCA from Manipal, and Aman Lal (24), an MBA from Pune, have teamed up to open Meri Sabzi, a vegetable shop with a difference, from June 20. The boys have provided three options for customers to order fruits and vegetables, through the portal www.merisabzi.com, an app called Merisabzi and a WhatsApp number 8351155455. Ankit, who worked as an event manager, and Aman, who was with a telecom company, came back home when the business bug bit them. ""We wanted to open something people needed everyday,"" said Ankit. ""Vegetables and fruits are a must, but busy young professionals, couples who have a packed day juggling many things or elderly people who don't want to depend on domestic help do face problems going to the market to buy the essentials."" ""Plus, the skyrocketing prices,"" chipped in Aman. ""From farm to wholesale to retail, prices keep inflating at every rung and the customer bears the full brunt of it. So, we wanted to put in place a seamless logistics, from farm to Meri Sabzi, to give our customers the best deal possible, eliminating middlemen."" The duo made their home delivery plunge after six months of planning. They took care of the software, built contacts with farmers on the outskirts of Ranchi in places like Bundu, Chanho Pithoria, Ormanjhi, Bedo, Nagri, hired delivery boys and opened up their Bariatu office. The efforts seem to have paid off. Thanks to their farm links, they have managed to deliver potatoes at Rs 15 per kg, onions at Rs 14, tomatoes at Rs 25, brinjal at Rs 22 and lady's finger at Rs 23 when the market rates are Rs 20, Rs 18, Rs 40, Rs 30 and Rs 30. In mornings, they delivery only vegetables from 6am to 9am. In the evening, they also deliver fruits and fresh veggies between 5pm and 8pm. Orders must be worth Rs 100 and above. If someone places an order worth Rs 250, he or she will get 5kg onions for Rs 50, the duo promise. The best part? Delivery is free of cost. So far the maximum orders are through WhatsApp, though the duo hope their own app also catches on. ""But our five delivery boys are busy all the time, which is important as we have just started out. We got 60 orders on Day One. We've come close to 100 orders in one day,"" said Ankit. ""We've got customers from Namkum, Hatia, Piska More, Booty More, Kanke Road, Bariatu, Morabadi, Ratu Road and many other places."" Their first customer, Bariatu homemaker Rachna Sahay, said she was thrilled when the fruits she had ordered, worth Rs 167, came smartly wrapped in plastic in a basket.

Prices of every day ingredients such as onions and potatoes have risen by about 75% and 50%, forcing many residents to keep them out of the daily diet.Customers in a number of city localities, including South City, DLF, Sushant Lok and Malibu Towne, paid between Rs 75 to Rs 90 for a kilogram of tomatoes on Tuesday. The cost of tomatoes had earlier risen from Rs 30 to Rs 60 around the second week of June.Residents said that tomatoes are essential in any kitchen and the ever increasing prices have forced them to avoid using the fruit in any dish. Chirag Sahani of Sector 31 said, No more tomatoes in salads. The fruit is too expensive that I first thought my vegetable seller was joking about the rates.The prices of onions, potatoes and brinjals have also increased by Rs 20 per kilogram on an average. The prices are likely to rise further in the next couple of days because of a delay in supplies and as the local production has been exhausted.Even the wholesale prices are extremely high. We are trying to reduce our profit window so that the people do not have to pay excessively high amounts for vegetables. The customers are complaining daily but there is not much we can do about it, Jitender Kumar, a retail seller in Sector 40, said.Officials of Gurgaon agricultural marketing committee said that the rise in prices is only seasonal.As the monsoon arrives, prices of vegetables start rising. The local supplies, which come from different parts of the state, including Mewat, Farrukhnagar and other areas, are over. We are depending on supplies from Himachal Pradesh, but because of the rain and road blockades, the trucks are not able to reach here on time, Deen Mohammad, state agriculture officer (Haryana), said."

144,"Rain whips up tomato, potato price",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160709/jsp/jharkhand/story_95578.jsp,2016-07-09,Telegraph,"A vendor sells precious tomatoes in Lalpur, Ranchi, on Friday. Picture by Hardeep Singh This week, Ranchi vegetable customers are moving around markets with long faces and half-empty bags. Reason? Heavy rains of last weekend have damaged a bulk of local potato and tomato crops, hiking their retail prices to Rs 24 and Rs 50 per kilo, respectively. Members of Pandra Bazar Samiti, the wholesale hub in Ranchi, said wholesale prices of potato and tomato are Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kilo. ""Water-logging in farms has destroyed both crops,"" said horticulture scientist of Birsa Agriculture University (BAU) K.K. Jha. Explaining why, he said: ""The recent heavy rains led to water-logging in poorly drained farms. So, potatoes rotted underground. Heavy downpour tore tomato skins and lack of sunlight led to their getting fungus."" Bhuidih, Mandar and Itki in Ranchi district, Gumla, Simdega and Hazaribagh are the state's tomato bowls. A bulk of potatoes are brought from Bengal, but the tuber also grows in Ratu, Ormanjhi, Pithoria, Namkum and other places in Ranchi. Imports from Bengal had also reduced drastically since monsoon picked up steam, rued a Ranchi wholesale trader Naresh Sahu, saying compared to last week's two trucks, only one came this week. BAU scientist Jha stressed it was possible to save tomatoes from tearing or fungus. ""Growing tomatoes in polyhouses in a controlled environment will enable them to survive heavy monsoon, but then, only a fraction of Jharkhand's tomatoes are grown that way. More farmers need to adapt to progressive ways,"" he stressed. Raj Kumar, MD of Jharkhand State Agriculture Marketing Board, added another valid point. ""We need cold storage for perishable items so that the produce we get is kept properly. So far, a few private ones have come up at Bero, Ormanjhi and other places, but we can't monitor them. The situation will improve when our 5,000 metric tonne cold storage comes up in Pandra,"" he said. But for now, the scene at Lalpur vegetable market, one of Ranchi's largest retail hubs, is dismal. A vendor had stocked 5kg of tomatoes against the 20kg. ""Due to heavy rain, the local tomato crop is damaged,"" rued Munna Oraon, when asked why there were so few tomatoes. ""I brought 5kg tomatoes from Bero farmers but that too is of poor quality,"" he admitted. Potato vendor Lokesh in Lalpur said he was selling them for Rs 24 a kilo. ""Last week, it was Rs 18 per kilo. But, what to do when supply is so poor? Our margins are thin."" Homemakers are feeling the pinch. ""I'm substituting fresh tomatoes with ketchup and using less potatoes in subzi,"" Lalpur homemaker Anju Saxena said. ""French fries are out of the menu for the time being."" But, scientist Jha had a word of hope. ""New cropping is on at tomato and potato hubs. By September, Ranchi customers can expect the duo at affordable prices,"" he said."

The state-wide strike had sent prices spiralling upwards due to shortfall of stock, resulting in retailers making a killing.""Vegetables went off stores after the July 4 strike. Even supermarkets were running short of stock. Potatoes were being sold at Rs 32 per kg. The situation will be worse if the strike is indefinite this time,"" said a homemaker, Vinita Patil.""Retailers and supermarkets will certainly rake in the moolah, taking advantage of the stock in their possession. Government should provide more outlets for direct marketing between farmers and consumers,"" said Sanjiv Datta, a consumer activist.However, Shivaji Pahinkar, secretary of Mumbai APMC, said, ""During the strike, arrival of vegetables and fruits at the Mumbai market will be less as compared to the regular supply but business will be as usual with farmers selling their produce directly to retailers and consumers.""""We welcome the government's decision on direct marketing by farmers, bypassing the APMC, but we too demand equal rights.

Ahmedabad, where eating out is almost like a norm, can be easily described as a foodie's paradise. With newer cuisines and tastes now ruling the palate of global Gujaratis, even the traditional Gujarati thali has gone through a delectable tranformation. From Chinese samosas, manchurian, dal-bati, nachos , Punjabi to Bengali sweets to churma laddoo and more, the thali has embraced essential elements of a melting pot  combining both modern and traditional in a delicious spread. AT checks out the thali.""For the longest of time the Gujarati thali was all about, two sabzis (green vegetables and pulses) one potato sabzi, 1-2 farsan (savories), dal/kadhi , rice, assorted Indian bread basket (chapattis, biscuit bhakris, puris ) one sweet dish along with chutneys, salad, buttermilk and pickles,"" say food industry observers. ""The thali was a mix of various textures ranging from flat, coarse, crunchy blended with an array of varied tastes. While there are dining halls in the city that still serve the original thali , other places have started including non-Gujarati elements to please the changing food habits and palate of the people.""With many restaurants and even food wagons dishing out some delicious different cuisines, the market for food has expanded making it a tough place to survive. While there are many thali joints that have stayed true to their original menu, there are other places who have included different cuisines to maximize their profit.""One of the major reasons why the thali has undergone such an evolution is because the city is witnessing a cosmopolitan population. Along with people from other states, you also see foreigners travelling to Ahmedabad quite frequently. So the restaurants have started including items that these people can easily relate to along with enjoying some new tastes,"" says restaurateur Abhay Mangaldas.Praveen Purohit, city based restaurateur feels that items like mini idli, Mexican tacos , nachos, spring rolls et al are there to fulfill the demand. He says, ""Not only our guests come from different parts of the globe, they also have good knowledge about food and are open to try something different. So we make it a point to include a few items that suit their taste buds as well. Another major reason is that majority of people find the thali too sweet for their taste, be it dal/kadhi or even the sabzi. So, we started infusing elements that balance out their taste.""While the city's population is going multicultural, there are many new thali places that are coming up at newer and posher locations, says Dilip Thakkar, founder of one of the Gujarati thali dining halls in the city. ""Initially, dining halls and restaurants serving authentic Gujarati thali were restricted to areas like Ashram Road, Usmanpura, Navrangpura and certain areas in the walled city. But now these restaurants have expanded to newer areas. And infrastructural cost goes up when you expand your business to a more expensive locality. To break even, or to make profit, you need more attractive dishes, which then amounts to the addition of popular and exotic dishes.""I love to indulge in fusion food. I have also been to restaurants and dining halls, where there are lot of items that are not there in the traditional Gujarati thali. Although, I wouldn't mind indulging in such a fusion thali occasionally, I still prefer the authentic Gujarati thali that has all the elements of Gujarat.Eating out means trying out something different or maybe a different version of your favourite cuisine. I have had Gujarati thali that had starters like samosa and manchurain and I think this inclusion is great as foodies from various parts of the world can relate to such items. They can relish the authentic Gujarati tastes whilst still having something that they love to indulge in.I love gorging on the authentic Gujarati thali, as it has many different textures and tastes. Although I'm not fond of fusion food, I would prefer if varied varieties of the same dish that are made in different parts of Gujarat are included instead of including different dishes that are not even a part of the traditional thali."

Traders, brokers and workers have declared yet another indefinite strike, this time to protest against the government's decision to allow farmers to sell in the open market.Of the 600 truckloads of regular vegetable supply, only 100 arrived at the APMC on Monday . The shortage pushed wholesale prices to an all-time high, hitting the retail market hard. Some traders blamed heavy rain in Nashik for the shortfall. Others like Vashi trader Narendra Shelke claimed, ""Fearing losses due to the upcoming strike, farmers from Pune, Nashik, Satara, Sangli and Solapur stopped supplies to the APMC on Monday . Hardly 50 truckloads of outstation supplies and an equal number from across Maharashtra could reach the Vashi market, which pushed prices through the roof.""It is not clear what farmers will do with this pending stock of fresh vegetables, especially since it spoils easily during the monsoon. Logic dictates that they would despatch the produce quickly before the bandh begins and cut their losses.Consumers are furious that middlemen should continue their strike plan despite the dire situation. ""Already , dal is selling for Rs 120-180 per kg, vegetables for Rs 100-200 and dry condiments have come to cost the earth. Now the APMC has decided to go on strike and halt supplies completely . The government or courts should either outlaw this bandh or ensure alternative arrangements for supply ,"" said Andheri resident Neerja Kajale. Borivli businessman Ujjwal Joshi said, ""The APMC's arm-twisting tactics have exposed that it is only concerned about its own members' welfare. It is a good thing that the government has at least made a beginning in demolishing its monopoly . Farmers will soon learn how to manage transportation and supply logistics.""Across Mumbai, cauliflow er, green chillies, garlic and capsicum are being sold for up to Rs 200 per kg. Fruits have become dearer too. Apple and pomegranate rose to Rs 180-200 from Rs 150-170.Matunga is among the costliest markets in the city . On Monday , French beans sold for Rs 200, bitter gourd, carrot and tomato Rs 80, onion Rs 30 and potato Rs 40. Prices were two to three times that of last week, said resident K A Viswanathan. Matunga has nearly 100 vegetable shops. Vendor Shiv Pande said fresh produce won't come on Tuesday .Dilip Yadav, a retailer at Navi Mumbai's Mafco retail market said, ""(We were) forced to stock only cheap vegetables to cater to our regular consumers. Even common vegetables are selling above Rs 100.""""Consumers are at the re ceiving end due to the sparring between the government and middlemen,"" said Aarti Jambolkar, a homemaker.The onion and potato market began its strike from Monday. Prices promptly witnessed a jump of Rs 2-5 per kg.Onions with surplus production this season rose to Rs 18-22 from Rs 15-18 earlier.With inputs from Bella Jaisinghani"

As farmers cannot sell their produce at APMC markets, they can sell them at PCMC-owned vegetable markets, Jagtap said, in a memorandum submitted to municipal commissioner Dinesh Waghmare.Delisting fruits and vegetables from the APMC Act has allowed farmers to directly sell their produce without the need for middlemen. The move aims to safeguard farmers' interests and keep a tab on price rise, which is mostly blamed on middlemen.Over 1,000 truckloads of fruits and vegetables, including potatoes and onions, are unloaded at the Market Yard in Pune daily. Several trucks carrying fruits and vegetables are also unloaded at the APMC at Moshi in Pimpri Chinchwad. The offloaded goods are distributed to over 20 vegetable markets owned by PCMC. One of the main markets is near the Pimpri railway station. Jagtap rued that even before the rule was implemented, the traders have gone on a indefinite strike.""Most farmers in and around villages in Pimpri Chinchwad send their produce to Vashi, which is Asia's biggest agriculture produce market committee. PCMC can help farmers by allotting them space at its markets,"" Jagtap said.He The Chinchwad MLA further said that many vegetable markets, reserved in the development plan, have not been developed. ""PCMC can allot these plots to farmers. EventuallyIn the coming weeks, the number of farmers selling agriculture produce directly to people will increase. The farmers as well as as the common man will benefit from the move,"" Jagtap added."

Potatoes which were available at Rs16 a kg in the bulk market touched Rs22 on Tuesday as the agents planned a strike. Onions were up at Rs12-13 a kg as against Rs8-9 a kg. With this, the retail rates are expected to touch Rs30 and 20 per kg, respectively.The commission agents operating from Kalamana are on a strike from Wednesday against the government's move to end the monopoly of agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) run markets.Sheikh Ahmedbhai , the chairman of APMC said the management has received notice for a three-day strike. Though agents say they have planned an indefinite agitation, traders expect that the strike may not last beyond three days.Earlier, farm produce of all kind was supposed to be sold through the APMC market yard where business is dominated by the agents. They buy the stock from farmers and sell it in the trade channel. The APMC, on the other hand, is managed by a politically elected body. Jaiprakash Wasani , an agent dealing in onions and potatoes, said though agents in other APMC yards have already gone on a strike, those in Kalamana waited for three days so that the maximum number of farmers could sell their produce.A section of traders say that the strike itself will be a test of how APMCs' monopoly can be ended. There was no change in the rate of grains so far. As far as fruits and vegetables are concerned they can be traded even outside. Cotton Market where bulk dealers in vegetables operate will remain open. The major commodities available at Kalamana include onions, potatoes, fruits, vegetables and dry chilli.A chilli trader said even otherwise chilli trade takes place only on Mondays and Tuesdays. So a three-day strike from Wednesday will not make any difference.""The market is dominated by fruit traders. Now that the monopoly of APMC is over, the farmers may sell it directly to the consumer,"" the source said."

Satyendra Prasad, a vegetable vendor at Lalpur market, said, ""Heavy rain has damaged crops and vegetables have started rotting, thus reducing the total produce.

Rates of foodgrains also remained stable as supply at market yards is minimal during this season. Even though the new rule covered only fruits and vegetables, agents dealing in grains at Kalamna also joined the strike.The market yards are managed by an elected Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). Till now it was mandatory to bring the produce to designated market yards and commission agents played an important role in the system.This is how business happens in an APMC. Suppose farmer turns up with 50 bags of onions, he will contact a commission agent. As would the prospective buyers. The agent then arranges an open auction which is monitored by APMC officials. After the deal is struck, the farmer gets his money through the agent who pays from his pocket and offers credit to the buyer. The agent deducts a commission in turn. Some times, farmers leave their produce with the agents with directions to sell only at a specific rate. The agents also offer farmers an advance even before produce is sold.The new rules bar agents from charging commission from farmers. Instead they have to take it from the trader buying the produce. The farmer is also free to sell the produce even out of APMC. ""This can have a major impact on our business. The government is freeing farmers from APMC but the agents are still bound there. Commission is deducted from farmers' payment as a charge of services provided by us,"" said Rajesh Chhabrani, a director in APMC Kalamna representing the commission agents.""The agents provide farmers with ready cash. The money is paid to farmers and recovered from trader after nearly a month. Some times the trader defaults but the agent ensures the farmer gets his money,"" said Jaiprakash Wasani, an agent agent dealing in onions and potatoes. Chabirram, a potato grower from Mainpuri who brought his produce to Kalamna, said ""we trust the agents as they pay in cash. Will the trader do it too in the new system?""""After the recent negotiation after which the strike was called off, it was proposed to free even the agents from APMC. So in the future there may be no auction. The agents may also directly buy farm produce from even out of APMC yards and sell it directly to traders,"" said Chhabrani. A final decision is expected a month later.Kishore Tiwari, director of Vasantrao Naik Swavalamban Mission, a state government task force on farmers, said the move only diverted attention from the core issue. This would help less than 1% of farmers as a majority of them would still sell through APMCs. The real benefit will be there if the reforms also covered foodgrains and cash crops, he said.In a nutshell* State government has ended monopoly of APMC yards* Farmers free to sell produce anywhere* Agents dealing in APMC yards see red, and announce indefinite strike* Those in Nagpur joined on Wednesday. Others on strike since three days* Agents have struck a truce with government, strike called off for a month* Government may allow even agents to buy produce anywhere* A day's strike leads to moderate increase in rates of vegetables* The reforms only cover vegetables and fruits"

This had made them to sow seeds of commercial crops.However the eluding of rains even after completion of one month of rainy season has made the growers to worry over the future of the crops. If rain fails, farmers will incur huge loss this year as well, said an onion grower.To cultivate onion on one acre land, the growers have to spend at least Rs 45,000 including sowing, removing weeds and applying fertilisers. A good yield can fetch at least 80 quintals of onion from one acre land. The lack of rainfall will, however, affect the yield per hectare.At present, the onion growers are dependent on borewell for irrigating the farm land. Onion plants have grown well in Nagenahalli, Biluvala, Maccheri, Chikkabasoor and other areas. Onion has been sown on 1,894 hectares in the taluk.According to horticulture department statistics, tomato is cultivated on 211 hectares land in Sakharayapattana hobli. However, in reality, tomato has been cultivated on more than 1,000 hectares of land. Farmers started sowing tomato seeds when the tomato price touched Rs 70 per kg.On the other hand, potato is cultivated on 1024 hectares while green chilly is grown on 598 hectares."

The WPI numbers come on the back of already 22-month high consumer price inflation numbers released on Tuesday.Wholesale vegetable prices were higher by nearly 17% in June. Among vegetables, potatoes sold nearly 65% costlier on yearly basis. Cereal was 6.32% costlier, the government data showed. Overall food inflation was 8.18% in June.Price rise in onion, minerals, fuel, power and petrol was lower by 28.60%, 20.75%, 3.62% and 8.74%, respectively, the data showed. Reacting to inflation figures, apex industry body Assocham said the rise in WPI is in line with the industrys expectation as production denoted by index of industrial production (IIP) numbers released recently showed weak and unstable demand within the industry itself.This might have forced the industry to control and manage its over production and over capacity, which is already in existence, through restricting supply or put a cap on production that have resulted in an increase in WPI number. Inflation in manufactured products was 1.17%.Meanwhile, HSBC has said that retail inflation is likely to cross the 6% level over the next two months but will axease thereafter as food prices abate and the base effect normalises."

155,Why veggie rates rise 400% between farm & mkt,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Why-veggie-rates-rise-400-between-farm-mkt/articleshow/53217148.cms,2016-07-15,The Times Of India,"Take a guess how much veggie prices get marked up as the produce moves from farm to market . In the 250-km-odd distance that the crop moves from villages near Nashik to your local sabziwala in Mumbai, the cost of one kg of onion goes up by close to 400% yes, from Rs 4/kg which a Lasalgaon farmer earns to Rs 18-20/kg which a consumer pays. That's the extent of commissions extracted by middlemen in the food chain.And it's not just the onion trade that sees such artificial inflation. Potato, tomato, green chilly, okra, you name it and pretty much everything in the market goes through a 50-100% increase in prices as it changes hands from one intermediary to the next (see graphic). The irony is that the farmer is the one who gets the lowest prices.So when the Devendra Fadnavis government decided on June 28 to allow growers to sell their produce straight to retail chains and other direct sellers, that's the rent-seeking system that it tried to dismantle. In one fell swoop, it did away with the monopoly of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Companies (APMCs) in every district which manage the marketyards where auctions are held by wholesalers and commissions earned on every transaction.Direct marketer Mahesh Shelke who runs Krushjeevan Agro, an enterprise in which farmers themselves are investors, says, ""Direct marketing companies and farmer producer organizations like ours have gained immense responsibility with the revised rules. More retailers will approach us to source vegetables in order to avoid paying commission to APMC . We know exactly which grower has how many hectares of farmland, what he grows and the quality and quantity of produce. Farmers will get a better price while retailers and consumers will not be burdened by commission either.""The agro economy still works in a way that leaves farmers at the mercy of local agents who decide which crops to grow and when. In the absence of cold chains and storage facilities, growers have to coordinate with them at harvest time. Demand and supply determine farmgate prices; in case of a bumper crop, the farmer has to strike a deal with the agent before he harvests the produce. Since he usually lacks storage space and as the crop is often highly perishable, like say tomato or okra, the agent fixes a suitable price and day on which the crop is picked and transported to the market. For his efforts he ends up earning an approximately 30-100% commission.The agent next strikes a deal with a local trader or ends up hoarding in the event of a dip in prices. In case of vegetables with a longer shelf life, say onion, potato or green chilly, margins tend to be smaller because risk of loss is lower. However, if it is a more perishable commodity such as tomato or okra, the intermediary has less elbow room to negotiate. But if he has control over supplies of a particular produce or stocks from a particular region, he can demand a higher price.Eventually, a deal is made and the goods reach the APMC where wholesalers earn a commission by arranging an auction for the trader. Retailers pick up the produce and wholesalers earn a fixed fee ranging from 6.5% for potato and onion to 8% for other vegetables and 10% for fruits. Now it is this stage of the food chain that the government has specifically sought to do away with.Henceforth, farmers or their agents or even the traders can sell directly to any agency or seller that they want to without paying commissions. But in case a retailer wishes to use the APMC to buy goods, he would have to pay the commission instead. Now this may in turn get passed on to consumers. Wholesalers and retailers have called a meeting with traders on Saturday to discuss the matter.Subhash Deshmukh, minister for cooperation and marketing said to TOI, ""There is some confusion over payment of tax (commission) but it is between the traders and retailers and not at the government level. That they have to sort out. If need be the government will intervene."""

Fruit prices, on the other hand, stayed high as merely 25 truckloads arrived compared with around 300 on regular days.As many as 270 trucks of onions and potatoes arrived on Thursday. This saw retail prices of onions fall to Rs 18-22 from Rs 20-25 on Wednesday and potatoes to Rs 24-30 from Rs 30-35. Market experts say prices will return to normal with additional supplies on Friday.Sanjay Pansare, a leading fruit trader in the APMC , said, ""Unlike vegetables, fruits could not reach the market today as producers learned late on Wednesday that the strike had been called off. As most fruits come from other states, they will reach the market by Friday. We had only 25 truckloads sent by local growers.""Prices of tomato fell to Rs 60-80 in the retail market against Rs 80-100 during the strike. Green chilli stayed high, though, at Rs 160-200 due to less-than-expected supplies.Meanwhile, retailers who had bought vegetables at high prices during the stir, failed to get them sold. ""We incurred losses from leftover stock,"" said Sachin Gavas, a vendor.As the vegetable market reopened for the day's transaction in APMC, Vashi, on Thursday, a day after the indefinite strike was called off, retailers voiced opposition to the idea of paying commission to wholesalers. This delayed the auctioning process for over an hour. Later, the intervention of APMC officials resolved the issue.To break the deadlock, it was decided that though farmers have been exempted from shelling out commission, retailers were also given relief from commission for the day. ""Why we should pay commission on purchase,"" protested a Bhiwandi-based retailer Anish Shaikh.Rajaram Dhondkar, deputy secretary of APMC, Mumbai, who was present when the crisis erupted toldthat, ""From today farmers have been exempted from paying commission to the traders for selling their produce. At same time retailers were given exemption too from new commission to be paid to the traders for the day. From Friday onwards retailers will have to pay commission on the lines of the onion-potato market where all retailers adhered to the rules."

158,Erratic rain hits veggie prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160719/jsp/odisha/story_97421.jsp,2016-07-19,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, July 18: Customers are moving around in market places with long faces. With prices of most vegetables shooting through the roof, the domestic budget has taken a painful hit. Erratic rainfall in the past two months has jacked up vegetable prices in the state. The price of ladies finger, which was Rs 15 per kg at Unit-I market last week, has shot up to Rs 30 now. Even the price of potatoes, which was Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, has increased enough to stretch the household budget. Srimanta Jena, 32, a resident of Hanspal, said prices of tomato, ridge gourd and ladies finger had skyrocketed in the city. Beans that were already topping the charts at Rs 70 per kg a few days ago now cost Rs 80 per kg. Brinjal, too, has become dearer at Rs 50 per kg. ""This time of year, the price of ladies finger comes down considerably. It had come down to Rs 10 per kg even a few weeks ago,"" Jena said. Though the price of tomato has fallen to Rs 30 per kg from Rs 60, it still remains one of the costliest vegetables in the city markets. General secretary of the Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, Sudhakar Panda said incessant rain in May and scarce showers in June have affected the growth of vegetables in the green basket of the state - Balasore, Jajpur, Mayurbhanj and Sambalpur. ""Though many vegetables are procured from other states, the situation there is also not bright. Rainfall in Andhra Pradesh has been similar to Odisha. Therefore the supply of vegetables such as brinjal and ridge gourd has been affected. However, the price will fall once there is adequate rainfall in July and August,"" said Panda. Ashalata Kar, 50, a homemaker and resident of GGP Colony, said: ""Though the traders blame monsoon for the rise in prices, lack of proper storage and failure to check practices of unscrupulous traders creates this situation."" Potato, which was sold at Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, is available at Rs 20 per kg. ""Potato is consumed in large quantities and even a slight increase in the price affects the middleclass budget,"" said Shyamali Kar, 35, a banker and resident of Saheed Nagar. Panda said potato prices might fall when fresh produce is sourced from Bengal. Onion prices, which is now Rs 18 per kg at Unit-I market, too, will fall, he said. ""Traders in Nashik are on an agitation that may end tomorrow. Once the stalemate ends, the price of onion will fall,"" he said. He said the price would come down to Rs 14-15 per kg. Panda said the state government should provide facilities to farmers so that Odisha does not have to depend on other states. ""Besides providing the farmers with better returns, incentives such as good quality seeds, fertilizer and irrigation can keep the price of vegetables in check,"" he said. The state agriculture secretary Manoj Ahuja said the phenomenon was ""seasonal and nationwide"". He added that the prices of vegetables would come down once procurement was streamlined."

Now, it is the entire vegetable basket that is acting pricey in Ranchi, prompting homemakers to squeeze their kitchen budget in a holy month when eating non-vegetarian food is a strict no-no for many.Vendors at Lalpur and Kokar conceded that the rates of vegetables such as beans, capsicum, ladies finger, bitter gourd, carrot and brinjal had increased between 10 per cent and 50 per cent in a week, particularly with the advent of Shravan.Horticulture scientist K.K. Jha of Birsa Agricultural University, Kanke, broke the ugly news. The situation (of skyrocketing vegetable prices) is unlikely to change before September. In fact, rates may soar further because farmers cannot grow fresh crop in low land right now, he said.Explaining further, Jha said, People are currently buying vegetables that were grown before monsoon. The rains have damaged crops at many places, which is automatically pushing up prices. Besides, farming is now being done in upland alone. By the first week of October, the residents will get fresh vegetables at affordable prices.ARTI S.

Representatives of the retailers' associations and Agriculture Produce Market Committe (APMC) attended the meeting with the minister.The retailers' representatives claimed after the meeting that the government had assured them that it would study the feasibility and take a decision by August 21.Till the retailers made the welcome announcement of calling off their strike, citizens suffered because of vegetable shortage, high prices and poor quality. Most markets in the city were closed for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday. A few retail outlets open sold four-day-old stocks.Several tiffin providers in the city were mulling over suspending their services till Wednesday evening because of vegetables' short supply.

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe cost of Vellores favourite brinjal, the thorny variety, has shot up in the last few days. Traders attribute the increase in rate to poor yield following rain.A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam said the thorny brinjal was cultivated in many parts of the district such as Kollaimedu, Usoor and Chenganatham.People in Vellore mostly prefer to eat thorny brinjal than those supplied from other parts of the State such as Krishnagiri and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. It is like Vellores own variety and is fast-moving as it is fresh when brought to the market. However, the yield is poor due to rain, as the flowers are damaged.Hence, the rate has gone up from Rs.30-Rs.40 to Rs.60-Rs.80 per kg, he said. Apart from this, the rates of majority of vegetables continue to be normal. A kilo of tomatoes is priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while onions cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 18.

167,Greens give the blues,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160728/jsp/bihar/story_99149.jsp,2016-07-28,Telegraph,"A vegetable vendor at Anta Ghat in Patna on Wednesday. Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Its not just dal anymore; the entire vegetable basket is burning holes in pockets, prompting homemakers to squeeze their kitchen budget in the month of Shravan when many people avoid non-vegetarian food. The price-rise issue rocked the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday as well, with Trinamul Congress leader Derek OBrien saying it is worse to be vegetarian in India than a non-vegetarian because even though prices of meat and fish seems to be under control, the prices of vegetables and dal have sky-rocketed. Over the past few weeks, prices of vegetables such as including bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ladies finger, capsicum and aubergine have increased by anything between 10 and 50 per cent. Vendors in the retail markets in the city attributed the price-rise to short supply. Vegetable experts from Rajendra Agriculture University, Pusa, said insect infestation in agricultural fields in the monsoon is the primary reason behind short supply of vegetables this time of the year. Besides, the floods are also affecting the vegetable supply. Vegetable farming is comparatively a more sophisticated form of farming than regular crops. While other crops like paddy and maize can be cultivated amid heavy rainfall conditions, green vegetables, especially the creeper varieties, get easily damaged under such conditions, said Udit Kumar, a vegetable expert at Rajendra Agriculture University. Fertilisers, fungicides and pesticides in the vegetable fields are normally sprayed either in the morning or evening, he added. At times, farmers are unable to spray the fertilisers and pesticides owing to heavy rainfall or flooding. The situation is aggravated in riverine areas, which are instantly flooded when the water level in rivers rises, said Udit. Vegetable vendors corroborated the experts view. Majority of the vegetables in this market come from Muzaffarpur, Motihari and Saran, said Mahavir Rai, a vendor at Punaichak vegetable market. However, a large chunk of green vegetables grown in the low-lying areas at those places either get damaged or are washed away at this time of the year owing to heavy rain. The short supply raises the prices. Majority of the vegetables in this market come from Muzaffarpur, Motihari and Saran, said Mahavir Rai, a vendor at Punaichak vegetable market. However, a large chunk of green vegetables grown in the low-lying areas at those places either get damaged or are washed away at this time of the year owing to heavy rain. The short supply raises the prices. It has been raining vigorously in north Bihar districts and neighbouring Nepal over the past fortnight. The state government has declared nine districts as flood-affected as of Wednesday and the rising water level in a number of rivers has affected agriculture activities across much larger areas. As per the daily flood bulletin issued by the disaster management department, around 60,000 hectares of croplands had been flood-affected in the state as of Tuesday. High demand While the supply of vegetables has been hit due to the rains, their demand has increased with the advent of Shravan, when a large section of Hindus abstain from eating non-vegetarian food. Health experts also suggest light diet during the rainy season. As the general hygiene is comparatively bad at this time, it is normally suggested to avoid oily and spicy food. During rainy season, chances of water-borne diseases such as jaundice, typhoid and cholera become higher, said Patna-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi. Kitchen strategy Homemakers have had to adapt to the soaring vegetable prices. Although green vegetables are rich in various nutrients, I have reduced their usage lately owing to the soaring prices. I am using more of non-green vegetables like soy bean, paneer and chhola among others, said Anita Jain, a homemaker who lives on Bhattacharya Road. Restaurants are also facing the brunt of the vegetable price-rise. Though we are not altering the quality of vegetables we are serving, our profit margin has definitely dropped owing to soaring vegetable prices. We keep looking for different vendors to find the most suitable prices, said Abhishek Parmar, owner of Swadesh restaurant on Boring Road. REASONS FOR PRICES HEADING NORTH Insect-menace: Farmers are unable to spray fungicide and pesticide in the fields and creeper plants are damaged by insects very soon Flooding of riverine area: Farmland in low-lying riverine areas in places like Muzaffarpur, West Champaran and Vaishali among others inundatedHow menu is being tweaked to tackle the vegetable price-rise Usage of more potatoes and less green vegetables as the prices of potatoes have come down lately Usage of non-green vegetables like soyabean and paneer among others"

PTI photoTAKING ON Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the rise in the prices of pulses, vegetables and other essential commodities, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused the government of having made false promises and sought a definite date for when inflation will be controlled.You may make as many shallow promises as you want but give us a date by when the prices of dal will come down, Rahul said in the Lok Sabha during a debate on price rise initiated by CPI(M) floor leader P Karunakaran. This was his first intervention in the current session. The Prime Minister was, however, not present in the House.The Modi government celebrated its second happy birthday a few days back. While addressing the people, he spoke about Make in India, Connect India, Digital India, but he does not talk about price rise. Not once did he talk about pulses, potatoes and tomatoes, Rahul said.He also referred to the BJP poll slogan  Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi  to take a dig at the Prime Minister. A new slogan is now getting popular in the villages: Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi, he said.The Congress leader said that in 2014, a kilo of tomato cost Rs 18, which, he added, has now gone up to Rs 55. Urad and Tur dal, priced at Rs 70 and Rs 75 respectively in February 2014, have risen to Rs 160 and Rs 180 this month, he added. Rahul further said that when the minimum support price (MSP) for Tur dal was Rs 45, its market value was Rs 75. MSP has now risen to Rs 50, but the price of the pulse is 180. There is a gap of Rs 130 in the NDA government, he said, seeking to know were this over Rs 100 was going. He alleged that the government had waived off Rs 52,000 crore owed by corporates and wondered what it had given farmers and housewives from the Rs 2 lakh crore it had saved due to a slump in crude prices.Watch Video: Whats making newsHitting back, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said such issues are settled through policies and not by setting dates.

Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts. This is a matter of statistics and not sloganeering, he said.On Rahuls reference to prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said sarcastically, everybody seems to be going to market everyday. He claimed that the Modi Government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country had seen a negative WPI inflation.The finance minister asserted that the NDA government had brought down prices and expressed the hope that with a good monsoon this year, prices would further reduce. He acknowledged that high prices of pulses remained a matter of concern but pointed out that steps were afoot to reduce the gap between demand and supply. He said India produced the maximum amount of pulses, recorded their highest consumption and imported the maximum amount. While the demand was for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes. He said the production of pulses was expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
169,The importance of questioning the message,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160802/jsp/opinion/story_99957.jsp,2016-08-02,Telegraph,"Literacy today does not imply just the ability to read and write. It implies the ability to think critically about all the communications that reach us in different forms including images and sound-bites. As educators today, we are called upon to deal with multiple literacies concerning medical, consumption, computer, financial and so on. But media literacy is what I wish to focus on just now. Media literacy indicates the ability to sift through, analyse and apply critical thinking skills to messages that inform, entertain and sell to us every day, round the clock. Perhaps it would be more accurate to use the term, ""media and information literacy"". The term, ""information"", is especially important in current times, in view of the number of young people being influenced and converted through information over the internet. For some years now, children have had access to all kinds of information and have been the recipients of all kinds of messages. The fall out is that either their minds are invaded or their pockets - rather, their parents' pockets. By the time they reach their teens our children would have spent thousands of hours in front of the television, surfing the net, playing video games, listening to recorded music or engaged in socializing on the internet. It is evident that their understanding of the world around them - which they seem totally oblivious of at times - does not come from other human beings but from the media. Although our children have almost unlimited access to information we tend to agree with the general belief that they are quite ignorant about the real world, that children of the information age watch more and know less but feel as if they know more. One of the reasons why they appear to know less is that since information is so easily available they do not feel the need to process the information deeply enough. This reminds me of an applicant for a teaching job who on being asked a very simple conceptual question replied that she knew the answer when she was preparing for her MA examination but had forgotten it since and would have to look up her notes. Clearly, this person had not assimilated the concept in question. She had merely learned it for an exam and had consequently not been able to retain it in her memory after that. A senior scientist friend had lamented once that these days the purpose of learning had been reduced to doing well in exams. There are several problems with regard to the abundance of information that is accessible to all and the undesirable nature of some of it. While educators are concerned about helping students sift, validate and process the information that is available, parents worry about the dangers of the cyber world, about the impact of sex and violence, and the risks involved in the interactive nature of social networks. But also, there is an urgent need to look out for stereotyping, gender biases, inaccuracies and questionable value judgments that come across ever so often. It is futile to try and control the onslaught of the media or to try and protect our children from them. The media are all-pervasive - the sides of buses and trams, backlit hoardings, television, radio, newspapers, magazines, flyers, banners, slogans on carry-bags and messages on t-shirts - you just cannot avoid the exposure. Nor can you screen them. In these circumstances the best strategy would be to teach children to engage with the media sensibly and intelligently. This way their critical thinking skills would be honed, they would learn to ask pertinent questions and they would develop the qualities of a responsible citizen. They will soon learn to interpret the cryptic messages on their friends' t-shirts and decide what messages they themselves wish to spread. Incidentally, I have often wondered why people wear offensive, rude and sometimes obscene pieces of writing or images across their chests. And worse, why do parents make helpless toddlers sport t-shirts with ridiculous slogans like ""I am cuter than your kid"" or ""My mom is hotter than yours"". By learning to process all information, the chances of young minds being influenced, manipulated or brain-washed would be considerably reduced. The last is vital today in view of the large scale ""radicalization"" that is taking place with chilling consequences. Hate speeches, rhetorical grandstanding, fiery pronouncements and the biased reporting of events are leading to a climate of intense intolerance. No matter what is done to maintain vigilance in the virtual world, it is in the real world that these issues must be tackled. So, the earlier we begin the likelier that peace will have a chance. When media literacy was first introduced in our school a few years ago, it was partly to address an increasingly consumerist society. The recognition of the power of children to influence the buying decisions of the family had led to them being made the chief targets of corporate selling. Children successfully nagged their parents into buying the things they desired. It was also observed that clever advertising lured them into certain behavioural paths such as eating junk food or throwing tantrums to get adults in the family to buy them the latest gizmos or toys. It is children who increasingly decided on the brand of toothpaste, shampoo, cereal or potato chips to be bought, and they even played an important role in selecting the new family car. In the recently released book Nawabs, Nudes, Noodles, the author, Ambi Parameswaran, says that ""as India changes, its advertising will also change and become a force multiplier. That is the power of advertising."" So we thought that if we taught children to ""question the message"" appropriately they would not only become responsible consumers but they would also develop the habit of not accepting any message passively. We were also concerned about the images of masculinity and of the 'perfect' female body, of fair skin and silky hair that were being constantly projected. We wanted our children to know the truth behind these images and to tell them about air-brushing and Photoshopping and to look out for biases and inaccuracies. The set of questions we had in mind were: Who is the message for and who wants to pass on this message and why? Have they left out anything I should know? How have they grabbed my attention? Do pictures always tell the truth? Have I been influenced by marketing strategies and powerful ""hidden persuaders""? Our domestic help, Jamuna, gets really annoyed with marketing gimmicks which she terms chalaki byabsha or ""clever business tricks"". She is not formally educated nor is she media savvy or consumer literate, yet she does not get taken in by the free bowl that is given with the package of detergent powder or by the attractive packaging or by the ploy of enticing the customer to buy three articles for the price of two. She is especially wary of extra-large containers that turn out to be only one-third full and she has learnt to look at the weight and the MRP marked on the packet and is able to compare different branded products by working out the unit price. Impressively, she is also suspicious of the terms, ""new"" and ""improved"". She firmly believes that these words were yet another of those business tricks to deceive the customer - ""What is 'new'?"" she protests, ""they are selling us the same stuff in a dressed-up box."" This reminds me of a ""new"" or ""latest"" edition of a textbook, which, on closer examination, is found to have added just one new poem or rewritten chapter. I find Jamuna far more informed, aware and canny than many educated people when it comes to buying consumables or even responding to news. All parents want their children to be abreast of current affairs. As far as the school is concerned, general awareness is an intrinsic part of education. The old method of reading out newspaper headlines in class does not work anymore as reporting styles have changed drastically and children have to be taught afresh what is meant by news. Some of the questions to ask children pertain to the difference between news and entertainment, the meaning of infotainmentand the meaning of tabloidization. Here too, they must look out for biased reporting and find out the political leanings of the owner of the newspaper, magazine or news channel. Our senior students know that business houses and political parties try to gain control over print and electronic media. They are old enough to understand the question of vested interests and what happens when the advertiser is the main source of revenue. They are well aware that dailies and news channels owned by political parties are likely to be blatantly one-sided in their reporting. Media literacy is not media bashing. Children can be taught to construct their own mass media with themes like ""Save Water"" or ""Do not Honk"". Through such activities they will learn the importance of the media. Media and information literacy is an essential form of literacy for the 21st century. It should not be regarded as an additional subject but must be woven seamlessly in the school curriculum in such a manner that students will apply their critical skills to every message and every bit of information that they are exposed to. It is hoped that through this sort of education they will also question their textbooks as well as their teachers and, most important, they will question the right of others to impose their beliefs on them.

About 100 hectares of land is under garlic cultivation this season.Farmers in Kanthallur, where cool season vegetables are largely cultivated, has largely shifted to garlic cultivation citing problems in marketing and low prices for traditionally cultivated vegetables such as potato, cabbage, beetroot, and carrot.As per the estimate of the Kanthallur Krishibhavan, about 100 hectares of land is under garlic cultivation. Kanthallur Agriculture Officer Murugan told The Hindu on Monday that there was a major shift to garlic as its price had gone up the last season. Most farmers who cultivated potato had shifted to garlic as there was a slump in the potato price following a bumper production in the last season. Potato used to be the main crop in Kanthallur. Areas under grantis cultivation were brought under potato cultivation through a government project.Farmers mainly cultivate the Mettupalayam variety of garlic, which, though small, is of high quality. Mr. Murugan said the farmers sold it at the Vadukapatti garlic market in Tamil Nadu, for want of a selling space in the State.The present price for garlic is around 200 per kilogram.The growth period for garlic is three months and Kanthallur is all set to start the harvest within two weeks, said P.T. Mohandas, a farmer and president of the Kanthallur Cool-Season Vegetable Marketing Society. He said the sale was brisk in Vadukapatti market and farmers were enthused with the high price in recent times. Garlic from Vadukapatti is mainly used in pickle production centres and Kanthallur garlic has an upper hand in terms of price.Mr. Mohandas said that unlike other vegetables, farmers can keep the garlic dried for three months.Newly harvested garlic can be sold on the spot too, he said.Enquiries from agents of the Vadukapatti market have poured in with the harvesting season nearing, he said."

Traders at Muhana Mandi claimed that since it is no harvest season for the vegetables, there is an acute supply crunch which has contributed to the price rise of the vegetables which are almost 40% more compared to 2015.Tomatoes which were selling at Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kg in the wholesale market a fortnight ago, are now being sold at Rs 45 to Rs 50.

The prices are going to further increase in the coming days.""Wholesalers at Muhana Mandi said that in the coming days to the rise in the vegetable prices will continue. ""Until we get fresh and new lot of vegetables, the supply will be less and prices will be higher,"" Phatak added."

Against Rs 28 per kg for the best ladysfinger in the wholesale market, the retail market is selling it at Rs 80 per kg.

""Green pea was Rs 200 per kg till last week and has come down to Rs 160 per kg now,"" said Fateh Singh, a vegetable vendor in Mayur Vihar.While rising prices of vegetables are common during the monsoon season, consumers said they often have to pay a high price for poor quality vegetables.""I am purchasing tomatoes for Rs 50 per kg, potatoes for Rs 40 per kg and onions for Rs 30 per kg. Often the vegetables are in various stages of rot. The wholesale rates are much lower, so why are we paying twice as much in retail?"" asked Suman Gupta, a resident of Patparganj.Wholesalers said that the high prices will remain for some more time, especially since more rain has been predicted for the coming days.""It is not unusual for vegetable prices to rise during the monsoon. Fields are flooded and it is very difficult to bring vegetables out of the fields,"" said Mahinder Sanpal, member, APMC Azadpur.""Also, the vegetables start rotting because they get wet. It is the green vegetables that are affected the most. Another problem is that vehicles carrying vegetables are not being able to reach Delhi in time due to waterlogged roads,"" Sanpal added.The other reason for shortage of vegetables and consequent rise in price is the flooding of the Yamuna banks because of which local produce has been ruined."

Though we want to return home, we need at least a portion of what is due to us immediately as we have not sent any money to our families, a worker told The Hindu over the phone.Sources said that the Indian Embassy officials, who visited the camps, took down details of the workers. They said that they will make arrangements to get our dues but we are unsure of how that can be done. The situation is really tense and several rumours are going around the camps. Some say that we would be taken to Delhi and then sent home by train, while others say we would be taken to India and then paid Rs. 500 each to reach home, said another worker.Though the companies shut down sometime ago, their canteens continued to run for sometime. After they closed, we had nowhere to eat. Hundreds of Indians blocked the Mecca Road after which the Army came and then the Indian Embassy stepped in. Kind-hearted Indians and Saudi nationals have been providing food to us. The Embassy also arranged for rice, potatoes and other things, said a worker. Indian community organisations formed an umbrella body called Indian Community, Jeddah, pooled in money and are helping out with food, basic medicines and other necessary items. When we visited the camp two weeks ago, the workers were eating dry rotis. We immediately arranged for food from a restaurant and supplied them rice, dhals, oil and condiments so that the workers can cook and eat, said one of the volunteers with the Indian Community, Jeddah.Pon Kumar, Tamizhaga Kattada Thozhilalargal Mathiya Sangam, who has been helping bring back Tamils stuck in foreign countries, said that only when the numbers are so large the Indian government steps in to help. In gulf countries, hundreds of persons are stuck in prisons. All these workers would have taken loans to get the jobs and would not want to come back. I request the Indian government to talk to the Saudi Arabian government and ensure that these men are provided with an alternative job, he said.M. Babu Murugavel, former Arani MLA, whose area has a lot of people working in countries including Saudi Arabia, said that many of these labourers would have taken loans to get visas.Though ticket, visa and other expenses would amount to under Rs. 50,000, they end up spending nearly Rs. 2 lakh just to reach those countries. Most times they are treated badly and return home in a sorry state. The entire emigration process needs to be streamlined, he said."

Telegraph pictures Manoj Tanti, a 35-year-old farmer in Jamui district's Kedia village, is brimming with pride and joy these days and the source of his happiness is a huge, white container positioned in the nearby fields. The container is the state's first solar-powered cold storage and is expected to change the fortunes of the village, around 170km southeast of Patna, home to 650 and odd people. ""We had to sell potatoes and onions at throwaway prices to middlemen. We could not store them for long at normal temperatures,"" Manoj told The Telegraph. ""But with the solar cold storage, we can keep our vegetables for longer periods and sell them at our own discretion."" This state-of-the art cold storage set up in the Barhat block of the Maoist-ravaged district has a capacity of 5 tonnes and a back-up power supply of around 30 hours. Normally powered by solar panels that heat a thermal plate replete with various devices, the cold storage can run on regular power supply and diesel generator during the monsoon. Greenpeace, the environmental NGO that adopted Kedia village in 2014, has facilitated the cold storage worth Rs 12 lakh - the funds for which were collected from the villagers and crowd funding. Over the past two years, the farmers have diversified their crops and started growing a variety of vegetables with the help of organic fertilisers and minimum use of pesticides. ""Crowd funding was managed in metro cities, with several film and television celebrities such as Waheeda Rehman, Pooja Bedi, Meiyang Chang and Pankaj Tripathi,"" said Ishteyaque Ahmad, Greenpeace's campaigner for sustainable agriculture in Kedia. ""Though there is a good demand for vegetables from this village in the market, farmers had to sell their produce at throwaway prices in the absence of a cold storage. The cold storage will be managed by the farmers' cooperative and will help them save their own seeds for crops like potato."" In a country where 40 per cent of farm produce is wasted because of no storage space and inability of small and marginal farmers to afford exploitative rates of regular cold storages, this is a boon. Ishteyaque said the cold storage is just one part of the ""Kedia model"" of sustainable agriculture developed in consultation with farmers and government officials to utilise existing central and state government schemes and subsidy programmes for rural development, agriculture and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Act. The money from these schemes have been used to construct 282 vermicompost units to provide organic fertilisers to farmers, 11 biogas plants to provide better cooking fuel, five pucca cattle sheds to help collect cowdung and urine to feed the biogas plants and for pest management solutions, and ecological toilets, with a possibility of turning excreta into fertilizer. For the next step, Greenpeace has invited labour resources minister Vijay Prakash to inaugurate the solar facility on Thursday. ""After inauguration, we are aiming to advocate for the 'Kedia model', including solar cold storage, with the Bihar government to have it on a pilot basis in at least one village in each of the 38 districts,"" said Ishteyaque. ""It should be extended to other villages as no aid is required for it and the technology is easily available."""

The party has already dislodged the Congress as the main opposition in this last bastion of the Left.A request from the TMC forced all private schools to remain closed on Tuesday in her honour. With a desire to expand the party base in this northeastern state, Banerjee lashed out at the BJP-ruled government at the Centre and the Left Front government in Tripura for adopting anti-people policies. Banerjee stressed she would have to build up a movement to overthrow the Marxists the way she has done in her home state ending 34 years of Left rule.Addressing a rally at Vivekananda Stadium in Agartala, Banerjee said the people of West Bengal had voted the TMC back to power with a thumping majority for its pro-people activities and development. ""I am sure, the people of Tripura have already decided to throw out the Left Front government for its anti-development stance and undemocratic activities. The Trinamool Congress will form a new government here after a year,"" the chief minister stated. She alleged that 23 years of uninterrupted LF rule in Tripura could not ensure basic healthcare and education. Hundreds of people go to Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad daily for treatment. The government, which has been pocketing public funds, does not have the right to criticise others, she said.""Agriculture, industry and manufacturing sectors are suffering from multi-phased crises resulting in unemployment and crime, which the Manik Sarkar government is yet to understand,"" pointed out the chief minister.The price of essential commodities has been sky-rocketing in Tripura and potato is being sold at Rs 40/kg. ""How can the LF government remain in power after that? They must step down immediately. They are always complaining that the Union government is depriving them. How can a democratically elected government be solely dependent on the Union government after 45 years of attaining statehood?"" she questioned.""West Bengal had to suffer 34 years Left misrule. However, in the last five years, industry and agriculture have got a boost and a large number of youths have found employment. I promised the people I would bring back the lost glory,"" she claimed.""Today I am committing to the people of Tripura that in the 2018 election, the entire West Bengal Trinamool Congress will mobilise its energy to overthrow the Left. I will come again and again. We will share the joys the woes of the people here,"" she said.Criticising the BJP, she alleged they are not interested in Tripura or West Bengal. Their target is to remain in power at the Centre. ""The BJP is not concerned about us; their target is to trigger communal tension wherever they get a chance. The Modi government is a government of the rich for the rich by the rich. It does not have any pan India stake or vision except tall talks. The Trinamool Congress is the only choice for Tripura to bring about change,"" she added. Mamata arrived here last evening and held several rounds of meeting with Trinamool Congress leaders. She left for Kolkata this afternoon along with a dozen leaders."

Moreover, since it is located on the canal bund and restrictions have been imposed on vehicle movement in the area, even if the wholesale market is kept open it will not be accessible. The local vendors are sourcing the vegetable from other areas and hence, the increase in prices coupled with the shortage of vegetables, said K Sivashankar, a roadside vegetable vendor in Satyana rayanapuram.Out of fear, people are hoarding veggies in large quantities for the next 12 days. Even if vegetables arrive tomorrow, the cost may touch the sky. So, we are buying and stocking them for the next fortnight, explained P Sirisha of Ayodhya Nagar.However, the marketing officials in Krishna district say there is no need to worry. We decided to open rythu bazaars in the city, round-the-clock during Krishna Pushkarams. We are also operating as many as 20 mobile rythu bazaars in areas that are at considerable distance from the nearest rythu bazaar, said J Ravi Kumar, assistant director of marketing.There are six rythu bazaars in the city including the one at Ibrahimpatnam and running them round-the-clock will certainly help. When pointed out that potatoes, tomatoes and onions are not grown in Vijayawada region and have to be imported from other parts, the official said they have made alternate arrangements even though restrictions on vehicles have been imposed in Vijayawada.The government itself will supply potatoes, onions and tomatoes to rythu bazaars during Pushkarams. Potatoes are being imported from Agra and Indore, onions from Maharashtra and tomatoes from Madanapalle in Chittoor district, said Ramesh Babu, officer in-charge of Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazaar but public, continues to be apprehensive."

181,Surging food prices have pushed the wholesale price levels to a 23 month high,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/surging-food-prices-have-pushed-the-wholesale-price-levels-to-a-23-month-high/,2016-08-16,The Times Of India,"With good monsoons in the current monsoon season breaking a fairly long period of patchy rainfall and the country soon expecting a bumper crop with farmers going on a sowing spree one would have expected the inflation rates to dip in in anticipation of the coming bounty. Unfortunately for the government and the monetary authorities the reverse seems to be happening with wholesale prices almost doubling in the most recent month even as experts caution the government to be on guard against a crash in commodity prices.Thus the WPI indices show that after a fairly long period of falling prices inflation has suddenly started surging with the increases going up from 0.79% in April to 1.24% in May, 1.62% in June and then finally to 3.55% in July. And commodity prices have largely fuelled the pickup. Price of rice, which has been falling till February this year, is now going up by 4% while that of wheat has moved up by close to 7% for a few months now.Similarly prices of other commodities like pulses, potatoes and fruits are soaring up in double digits some rising above even by as much as 50%. Other products like oil seeds have seen prices slowly crawling up to above 5% in recent months even as that of fibres has shot up by more than a quarter in the most recent month mainly due to the anticipated shortfall in cotton output. Sugar has also been doing badly with prices shooting up by more than a third in July.The surge in prices of important commodities, albeit by varying levels, has caused food prices to more than double over the last three months to 11.82% while that of primary articles has almost trebled to 9.38% over the last four months. There is certainly a concern as these price signals could be transmitted into the other sectors of the economy if they remain unchecked.But then prices of other products in the wholesale price index remain under check. Though commodity prices, especially that of food products, has suddenly shown an upturn the world over the huge excess capacities in heavy industry has ensured that prices of metals and metal products continue to fall and that prices of minerals remain far below the peak levels. The trends are also reflected in fuel and power. All this could neutralise the negative trends and hopefully contain the overall impact of the surge in food and commodity prices to some extent.Interestingly the pickup in commodity prices has been followed by a slow increase in manufactured good prices which turned positive in March this year and then slowly edged up to 1.82% by July. A deeper investigation shows that this is more likely to be a cost push inflation as it has been fuelled by an increase in prices of food products, sugar, edible oil and beverages. In fact the surge in cotton prices seems to have even pushed up prices of cotton textiles after many months of decline.Prices increases in most other manufactured goods, like wood, paper, leather, rubber and chemical products however remain sticky at the lower end. Only in case of cement has there been any significant improvement in prices after a long time. Prices of other important manufactured products like machinery and machine tools and transport equipment has almost remained stable for an extended period now. Thus one can say that the huge excess capacities in large segments of manufacturing will help contain the overall impact of any surge in commodity and food prices on the WPI to some extent."
182,Will the Sylheti paradox be solved?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160818/jsp/opinion/story_102933.jsp,2016-08-18,Telegraph,"There was a time, just a few years ago, when recent events in Bangladesh were a cause for celebration. After decades of famine and war and natural disaster, the country had achieved the longest life expectancy and the lowest fertility rate in South Asia. From 1990 to 2010, the rate of infants who suffered an early death fell by more than half. Over 90 per cent of tuberculosis cases were being cured. Long series in The Lancet and The Economist expressed admiration and wonder at these transformations. The latter compared contemporary Bangladesh to Meiji Japan, which enacted ""the most dramatic period of improvement in human health in history."" This progress remains incomplete. Bangladesh is still one of the most malnourished places in the world. Well over a third of the country's children are ""stunted"", the technical term for being intensely and chronically undernourished. The sundry permanent effects include a lifelong reduced cognitive capacity. Within Bangladesh, child stunting is worst in the northeastern division of Sylhet, where Helen Keller International has reported the rate to be fully 50 per cent. I recently travelled to Sylhet with HKI, one of the foreign NGOs combating malnutrition there. Around 20 kilometres away from the provincial capital of Habiganj, and beyond the outskirts of the town of Nabiganj, I visited three remote villages struggling with extreme malnutrition. Every last child in the area I met had the underdeveloped bodies, and particularly the skinny arms, that are the telltale signs of stunting. In other respects as well, Madhobpur, Manderkandi and Sreemotpur seem to epitomize rural South Asian poverty. The cows are skinny and sickly; medical clinics lack electricity; the local water has as much as 100 times the safe limit of arsenic. So it was a jarring moment when a bunch of children saw my group approach and produced smartphones to photograph their visitors (picture, above). Globalization had brought advanced mobile operating systems, but not adequate protein. This was evidence of the contradictory nature of development in Bangladesh more generally. Sylhet is a relatively rich district with, reportedly, Bangladesh's worst stunting rate; the southwestern district of Khulna, conversely, has one of the highest poverty rates in the country and also one of the lowest stunting rates. ""'The Sylheti paradox' is what we call it in our office,"" said Nicolas Syed, a United Nations official working on rural poverty in Bangladesh. The Sylheti paradox is a measure of the degree to which standard metrics of development and positive social outcomes may be disconnected. On the one hand, the remarkable success of Bangladesh in improving the well-being of its citizens has been strikingly detached not only from nutrition but also from economic growth, which has not been as dramatic as the health statistics suggest. The Economist pointed out that the average Bangladeshi lives four years longer than the average Indian, even while Indians are twice as rich. In explaining many of the most basic improvements in the everyday lives of Bangladeshis, wealth seems curiously tangential. The miserable health of Sylhetis exemplifies exactly what money alone may not bring. An enterprising people once known as sailors, the Sylhetis were reported by The Guardian to make up 95 per cent of the Bangladeshi population in the United Kingdom. In both New York and London, a vast majority of ""Indian"" restaurants are actually run by Bangladeshi Sylhetis. A great deal of the money made by Sylhetis abroad returns to their homeland. Twenty years ago, Habiganj lacked phones and roads; it used to take one or two days of travel by foot or boat just to reach an adjacent upazila, or county. When I stayed in the city a few months ago, my new hotel offered free WiFi, and I experienced no trouble driving from place to place. Yet these advancements have had surprisingly little effect on the health and diet of most Sylhetis. Sylhet is full of haors, floodplains underwater for so long that even well-maintained gardens often don't last over half the year. Many locals live on little hills surrounding the haors, which means they have trouble receiving basic services every year when their home becomes an island. Meanwhile the dense, tropical soil in Sylhet is not well-suited to agriculture, and a lack of crop rotation has led to a dire nitrogen deficiency. Culturally, Sylhet has a long history of religiosity and conservatism. Shah Jalal, the preacher who spread Islam in Bengal in the 13th and 14th centuries, lived in Sylhet, and his tomb is an important site for pilgrims. According to research cited by the Asian Development Bank, 60 per cent of Sylhetis pray daily, as compared to 35 per cent countrywide. In 2004 and 2005, Sylhet faced multiple Islamist terror attacks. Both religious and social conservatism have had a negative effect on the health of Sylhetis. As in other South Asian cultures, women tend to eat at the end of meals, after the men and children have their fill, leaving poor women only meagre leftovers. During my visit to Manderkandi, a leader of HKI's garden program named Chaiti was showing off her chickens. After a few minutes, one of her male in-laws, Shamanandha Vattacharjo, nudged her out of the way to take over the tour. The economist, Binayak Sen, among others, has demonstrated the strong correlation between female empowerment and nutrition in Bangladesh. Khulna, the poorer yet healthier district, also boasts a much higher level of female education than Sylhet. This link between female empowerment or education and family nutrition is evident in villages all over the district of Habiganj. According to local HKI officials, some of whom are from the area, many pregnant women refuse to eat protein out of fear that their babies will grow too big and make for an uncomfortable childbirth. Once born, children frequently do not receive sufficient breastfeeding for the first six months of their lives. The better-educated mothers of Khulna ensure that their children have notably diverse diets; in Sylhet, the lack of adequate breast milk is only one way in which babies and infants are deprived of essential nutrients. Until their teeth are strong enough, for example, children are not fed the small fish that Sylhetis eat whole, bones and all. In Manderkandi, Vattacharjo told me that these fish, caught in a muddy pond nearby, have been the area's only source of protein. Many of the relatively wealthier residents of Habiganj city suffer from similarly skewed diets. I had a glimpse of the city's eating habits at the restaurants Sky Queen Chinese and Mango, which is brand new and maintains an active Facebook page. Neither restaurant served a single dish with a healthy amount of vegetables, and most orders came with only scraps of protein. Across Bangladesh, malnourishment is not only a problem for the lower class: in the wealthiest quintile of society nationally, 21 per cent of children were underweight in 2010, according to The Lancet. If economic development is not solving malnutrition in Sylhet, what can? During my visit, I saw numerous ways in which NGOs improve the health of Sylhetis through modest interventions. (Here I should state an interest: an old friend of mine works for Helen Keller International, and I travelled with her to Sylhet, where HKI set up its project to combat malnutrition last year.) Not everyone in Bangladesh views foreign NGOs in the benevolent way they view themselves. Their strength and size have drawn criticism from those who charge that they disregard the national government as well as local power structures, leading to grassroots resistance, waste and NGOs exaggerating their achievements. The anthropologist, Lamia Karim, has argued that NGOs co-opted Bangladesh's intelligentsia and the allegiance of its poor, defanging overtly political left-wing resistance to the inequalities of the country. More troublingly, many of the recent terror attacks in Bangladesh have specifically targeted foreign citizens, including Japanese aid workers at the Holey Artisan Bakery and an Italian aid worker out for a jog. These killings may already be achieving their desired effect. ""They are leaving,"" Jillian Waid, leader of HKI's local research unit, wrote me of her fellow NGO expats. The United States Agency for International Development and Britain's Department for International Development have both, according to Waid, withdrawn their employees with families. Waid herself, who has worked in Bangladesh for the past seven years, now intends to get out soon. On my trip, I saw examples of the substantial small-scale help that has been provided over the years by foreign groups like HKI, Save the Children, and USAID, all of which are fighting malnutrition in Sylhet. In each village I visited, new gardens were producing nutritious vegetables such as okra and bitter gourd (picture, above). Where white-fleshed sweet potato has been common, HKI was helping to introduce a much healthier orange-fleshed sweet potato in its stead. The organization was also trying to popularize kangkong, a spinach that grows even in the watery soil of the haors. In Madhobpur, HKI had staged a test in which three separate plots showed the results of planting using the village's customary methods alongside two different natural fertilizers introduced by HKI. The difference was stark: large plants had grown in the second two plots, while the first was nearly bare. Popy Rani, a village mother who told me she had initially been sceptical of HKI, said she was persuaded to set up her own new garden after looking at the flourishing plants of a neighbouring village. HKI has led many other initiatives: classes on breast-feeding and preparing children well-rounded meals, for instance (picture, above), and financial help and instruction with poultry farms. The most concrete symbol of the potential of its efforts is the humble ""tippy-tap"". This is a plastic bottle tied to a post at an angle so that, if the top is unscrewed, air pressure causes a stream of water to pour out through a hole at the bottom of the bottle. The rest of the time, when the top is screwed on, the bottle retains its water. The tippy-tap is, in effect, a home-made faucet. In Sreemotpur, nobody used to wash their hands because of all the water wasted by pouring it out from a bucket. Now, a bar of soap and a tippy-tap stand at the centre of the village as basic tools of everyday life. In 1974, Bangladesh was a brand new state facing a famine while its government teetered on the brink of collapse. International aid shot up, and Bangladesh welcomed foreigners who said they wanted to improve the lives of Bangladeshis in ways the shaky government could not. The significance of aid efforts launched from abroad have since been surpassed by domestic groups, especially Grameen Bank and BRAC, which have collectively acquired well over 10 million microfinance borrowers. Grameen has also founded the country's leading telecommunications service, with over 56 million subscribers, while BRAC has established 400 legal aid centres and over 22,000 primary schools. Grameen and BRAC are not going anywhere anytime soon. Still, in places such as Sylhet, neither market forces nor the State and its domestic surrogates have supplied some of the basic necessities of a good life. Foreign NGOs bring expertise, initiative, and funding that are intensely needed. As murderous attacks on aid workers grow more frequent, the continuation of their work is imperiled. Bangladesh is on its way to providing unprecedented good health to a wide array of its citizens - but much more remains to be done. These are the stakes for a country whose violent fringe is beginning to drive the rest of the world away."
183,A noon meal that doesn’t put enough on their plate,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/A-noon-meal-that-doesn%E2%80%99t-put-enough-on-their-plate/article14574764.ece,2016-08-18,The Hindu,"Students of the Corporation Middle School in Choolai stay hungry for most part of the day, as the noon meal served in the school is insufficient.Noon meal organisers of the school blamed it on the lack of funds and claimed that they were unable to buy enough vegetables to feed all students. Besides, the fluctuating prices take the cost over the budget.Also, with the current fund allotted by the State government, it is difficult to buy enough vegetables and fuel to feed the 70 odd students everyday, even if the prices are not very high, said a noon meal worker on condition of anonymity.The Department of Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme, in 2012, had introduced a weekly menu, which included mixed rice, vegetable rice, boiled potatoes and eggs among other items in the noon meal programme. The department later increased the feeding charges in anganwadis from 56 paise to Rs. 1.13 per child for days when dal is prepared, which includes 70 paise for vegetables, 24 paise for fuel/cylinder and the rest for condiments. When there is no dal on the menu, the allocation is Rs. 1.35, including 80 paise for vegetables, 36 paise for fuel/cylinder and the rest for condiments. However, 5 paise is deducted from spices, as salt is provided by the Civil Supplies Department.The workers also get four subsidised cooking gas cylinders every year from the government. However, this is not at all adequate. Moreover, many schools do not even have LPG connection and they have to manage with firewood, complained N. Anusuya, member of the Noon Meal Organising Union.The per child per school day charge for children under the noon meal scheme was also increased to Re. 1.30 on days when dal rice is prepared and on other days the charge is Re. 1.70. For older classes, the allocation is Re. 1.40 and Re. 1.80 respectively.Most children come from far off places and the noon meal is their only source of energy. We cant always pay from our own pockets to buy vegetables. This has to be looked into, said Anusuya.Underweight a concernThe fifth Joint Review Mission report on mid-day meal scheme in Tamil Nadu, conducted by the Ministry of Human Resource Development and Department of School Education and Literacy in 2013, pointed out that of a total sample of 279 children, 19.7 per cent were found to be severely underweight and the percentage of normal weight children was only 12.1. Prevalence of underweight was more among girls (89 per cent) compared to boys (81.3 per cent). It had further stated that the funds allotted for purchase of vegetables could be increased due to hike in costs.In the current slab, the nutrition in the nutritious meal programme is being compromised, said S.A. Madappan, noon meal organiser and State president of Noon Meal Organising Union. To improve the situation, the Union has put forth their demands to the authorities demanding a Re.1 increase in the current allotment charge.K. Shanmugavelayutham, convener, TN-Forces added, Not only this, the allocation per child must be realistic. Only then will we be able to fulfil the true purpose of the scheme.Officials from the department said they were considering the unions demands. We also have to compare the hike in prices with previous years and other states. We shall do our best, said a senior official."

Farmers are devastated at the price fall.""The veteran trader said the sudden rise in tomato price to 100 a kg two months ago was due to lack of supply.""Vegetables such as tomato, carrot and beans that are brought in from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu, were diverted to Maharashtra and Odisha where the summer crop had failed."" Though there is excess supply now, a fall in demand is causing prices to plummet.Traders said the fluctuation in prices will crush the farmers. Soundararajan said, "" The price should be stable at about 20 a kg if the farmer is to make a living.""The price of green peas fell from 140 a kg last month to 40-50 on Sunday. Price of chayote (chow chow) came down from 30 to 15, beetroot price fell from 25 to 12, green chilli price fell from 70 to 30, and drumstick price fell from 70 to 30.Onion and potato prices remained stable at 15-20 and 20-25 respectively."

In order to restrict consumption of junk food by children, the food safety regulator is preparing a negative list of products that are high on salt, sugar and fat to prevent their availability in schools and their vicinity.""The list will have those food items which are known to have negative impact on health if consumed regularly and not desirable for young people,"" Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) chief executive Pawan Kumar Agarwal said. The list is expected to include products like chips, pizzas, burgers, ready-to-eat noodles, sugar-sweetened carbonated and non-carbonated drinks, potato fries and confectionery items.The move comes in the wake of rising burden of diabetes and obesity among children and youngsters. In October, the food regulator had also issued draft guidelines on wholesome and nutritious food availability in schools to control junk food consumption among children in India. The draft guidelines suggest restricting sale or availability of food items high in fat, salt or sugar within 50 metres of a school's premises.The number of diabetics in India has doubled from 32 million in 2000 to 63 million in 2013. It is projected to increase to 101.2 million in the next 15 years. Globally, at least 41 million children under five years were estimated to be obese or overweight in 2014.While the prevalence rate of obesity in this age group is still low in India at less than 5%, public health agencies have cautioned that the trend is fast catching up in low- and middle-income countries with companies targeting market space in developing countries like India."
187,The race to light up the last village,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-race-to-light-up-the-last-village/article14592893.ece,2016-08-25,The Hindu,"Jalan Singh, 30, has not removed the cardboard carton that protects the sides of his new Godrej refrigerator. You cannot miss the striking red cooling machine in the room. Having spent Rs.12,000 on it, Singh is proud of his acquisition. Sixty-nine years is a short time in an independent countrys life but it has been a long time for power to reach Singhs village, Tanwarpura, an hours drive from Barmer city in Rajasthan. Power that arrived in the village two months ago, although erratic, nudged Singh to buy a refrigerator. He opens it to show it to us, but its empty. The rains may have tripped some lines, a government official offers an explanation. Rains did lash the village a few days ago. Having been consistent this year, they promise good harvest and some extra income. Singhs spirits are not dampened by the temporary absence of electricity; he reels off his wish list: a fan, a cooler, and an atta chakki (flour mill).Rukh Singh, his neighbour, has beaten him to procuring an atta chakki . The flour mill means two extra hours of sleep for his wife. In the early hours before dawn, Tanwarpura wakes up to the sounds of the chakki as women work it to pound flour. With the manual mill, it took my wife four hours to prepare the flour for our daily meals. The electric one takes an hour, Rukh Singh says. His wife smiles behind her veil, allowing Rukh Singh to speak on her behalf.The Singhs got an electricity connection under the Modi governments flagship scheme of rural electrification launched in July 2015, the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). The governments goal is 100 per cent electrification by 2019. Official estimates peg the number of un-electrified villages in India at 18,452. Of this, the government claims to have electrified 10,097 villages till date, a figure that doesnt go uncontested.The lifelines of a villageAt least there is light, says 34-year-old Chagan Kanwar, a mother of two. Two weeks ago, for the first time, solar energy lit up houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti in Barmer district where she lives. Designated as a Desert National Park area and situated almost at the farthest edge of the State, a few kilometres before the border with Pakistan, the village has around a hundred households. Power for Kanwar means less pollution. The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining, she says. The inhabitants of this basti were accustomed to travelling 25 km to Gadra village to charge their mobile phones. A shopkeeper there would ask for Rs.10 to charge each phone. We used to take 10 phones once a week to get them charged, says Pan Singh. Mobile phones, lifelines for the villagers and the only connection to the outside world, when powered ran for a week.Their main lifeline, however, is the sun. Under the off-grid scheme of DDUGJY, houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti have been provided with a 100W solar panel which can light five LED bulbs, one standing 12W fan, and a socket to charge a mobile phone. These three utilities come as part of the solar kit, a one-time investment of Rs.1,029 which works out to 5 per cent of the total cost incurred to install the kit in every home. There is no burden of electricity bills.The villagers have become so accustomed to the absence of power that even its presence does not prompt them to switch on the fan. The two villages, Tanwarpura and Salam Singh Ki Basti, are examples of the grid and off-grid programmes of the Centre, which are committed to providing electricity in every village. Explaining the decision for this, the Executive Director of Rural Electrification Corporation, Dinesh Arora, says: States have generally preferred and adopted grid connectivity for most of the villages except in areas where connectivity is either not feasible or cost-effective.In Rajasthan, as at the Centre, a Bharatiya Janata Party government is at the helm. Both Central and State officials are racing to power villages, but they are also wary as the media has turned its gaze to the claims made by the government in rural electrification. Officials everywhere are now tutoring villagers on the art of communicating with the media. With a spate of critical reports on the app-based claims of electrification on GARV making the government more watchful, even the hint of a journalist in the remotest of villages sends officials into a tizzy.Promise of powerMeanwhile, in distant Uttar Pradesh, power is a touchy issue, especially as elections are set to take place next year. When the Centre claims credit for any development, the State is quick to point out loopholes.In Anandpur, a village at the edge of Hathras district which is famed for asafoetida, a dried latex that is indispensable to curries and dals (lentil), power comes and goes. A gift from Delhi, an LED bulb, has brought light into the lives of 70-year-old Ram Prasad and 17-year-old Rahul. The electricity meter, wrapped in plastic, is a prized possession and is precariously mounted on the mud wall of the house that has a small porch, a room, and a tube well in the courtyard. There is a toilet too, Prasad points out, seemingly well-versed in the drill of showing to outsiders the trappings of modernity that have crept into the village. The toilet is pitch dark; light hasnt travelled there yet.For rural India, the DDUGJY brings not only the promise of power to every village, but its attendant trappings too. Our ancestors will be happy. They never saw light, says Savitri, a resident, as she begins cooking potatoes and chapattis under the light of a solitary bulb. The bulb has freed her from having to swat insects that she would have otherwise battled with under the light of a kerosene lamp or candle.Glimpses of a fractious relationshipAnandpur is an odd mix of upper castes (mostly Thakurs) and backward castes. Adversity and deprivation is the glue that holds these communities together. Most of the villagers wear a bemused look as officials from the electricity department come inquiring about the availability of power here. Mukesh Kumar from the State Electricity Board examines 18 meters installed in Anandpur and requests people to show their papers. He looks agitated. We were not informed about the installation. What if the villagers refuse to pay for the power or their homes collapse in the rains? he asks. The question hangs in the air, offering a glimpse of the fractious relationship between the Centre and State.The Prime Minister claimed in his Independence Day address that Nagla Fatela, a village in Hathras, was electrified but the media found surprised villagers and a dark village when it reached there. The embarrassment caused by this episode has left everyone on edge here and the U.P. government is determined to keep a check on every connection by sending its officers to the field. Kumar is one of them. Other senior officials have been dispatched from Lucknow. Says Rakesh Verma wryly: Ideally, the village should be getting 14 hours of power but that seldom happens. Lets see what happens after the elections. The officials wait patiently for Anandpurs residents to show their cards. Others who also wait are the men who installed the meters, the Centres officials.The scheme is premised on the Centre and the State working in tandem. The Centre provides the infrastructure; the State provides the power after working out its availability  12-14 hours a day is what has been calculated. The reality plays out differently as power keeps tripping. Young Anshu whispers that she saw a snake first when the light came on some time at night in her thatched hut just two days ago. Snakes are common in the tiny village of Anandpur, which is ringed by paddy fields. The villagers could not steal power like other villages nearby  katiya , or the illegal tapping of power, is rampant there  as high tension wires made that impossible.The power is erratic and the wait long and uncertain. We wait and watch; so do Savitri and Rahul. Everyone looks at the cooler fan installed upside down, a common jugaad in these parts, which works when the electricity comes. This is a welcome addition to their huts as it helps make the nights less muggy.In Anandpur, the monthly income of a family of five rarely exceeds Rs.2,000. Electricity is a luxury. Agricultural holdings are small, and income is supplemented by selling milk. The villagers are worried; they ask as they wait for the power to come, Do we have to pay the bill? As per the plan, the village will get power from 12 p.m. to 6 a.m. Pointing out the absurdity of the schedule, an official on a visit to the village says, We dont draw the plan. We follow instructions from Delhi. Contesting this, Mr. Arora says, The responsibility of releasing electricity connections to individual households lies with the discoms chosen by the State.These villagers are the Antyodaya card holders. In other words, they are the poorest of the poor whose entitlements are a few kilograms of rice and two litres of kerosene a month. The supplies get exhausted quickly and they are forced to purchase these goods from the open market. The nearest school is 2 km away and the villagers are wary of sending their girls to school. Rahul is studying for an examination and he finds the light a godsend. I can study now when the light comes; I dont have to study under the lamp, he says, wistful though for a regular supply.The State government is working out a way to regulate the tariff so that people pay for the power they consume. From the headquarters in Lucknow, the chairperson of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, Desh Deepak Verma, has been keeping a watch ever since false claims were made about electrification, by dispatching officials to the ground. He says the problem is with the definition of an electrified village. One in 10 homes is all that a series of schemes have focussed on. What about the 9 others? And within the 10 per cent, only poles have reached some villages; last mile connectivity is still distant.Its 6.30 p.m. when dusk falls to herald the night. Thirty hours have passed, but Tanwarpura has no power. Is it because of the rains? Electricity is transformative, but only when it is available, Rukh Singh says. We get it for about two hours a day. A tiny bulb dispels darkness in Jethmal Singhs house. I got my connection under the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) governments Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) before it was re-christened by the BJP government as DDUGJY. Only five connections have come in the last six months under the DDUGJY, he says. Thirty of the 35 households which have electricity in this village were electrified under the RGGVY. A Tata Sky dish hangs at the back of Jethmals house. The TV, however, is missing.On August 12, the governments field engineer encouraged us to purchase a television so that we could tune in to Prime Minister Narendra Modis Independence Day address. We bought the set on the 13th, he says. People gathered in Jethmal Singhs house on August 15. But the TV conked off after the Prime Ministers speech and has been sent for repair.Bhiram, who lives ten minutes away from Jethmals house in the nearby village of Tirsingra, also listened to the Prime Minister speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort. The field engineer told me that light would reach my village too, he says. But there was a problem. In April 2015, the government identified 34 un-electrified villages in Barmer. Tirsingra was not one of them.Un-electrified and not on the listA hundred kilometres away from Tirsingra, Mahadev Nagar has a similar story. There is no power in the village and it is not on the governments radar. Surta Ram, 40, calls fellow villagers to gather on the lawns of the primary school to discuss the problems related to lack of power. Photographs of Indira Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar hang prominently in his house. He calls himself a samaaj sevi (social worker). For the last five years, we have been contacting government officials at all levels: the Collector, the MLA, and others. Now they tell us that our name is not in the government survey, he says. Ten days ago, the MLA said that our village will see light this Diwali. Lets see.Mahadev Nagar has a primary health centre, a facility that other villages mentioned as lacking here. But it is just a building. There is no doctor here. No one wants to come here because there is no electricity, Surta Ram says.Adds 39-year-old Puga Ram: Yesterday, three malaria patients had to travel for 5-10 km for injections. The ambulance also doesnt come inside our village. Puga Ram teaches in the village school and is concerned about the childrens education. This is the age of computers. How will these kids get digital literacy if there is no electricity, he asks, distressed. There are five classrooms in the school; one is under construction. The heat inside the room compels the teacher to take his classes on the sands outside under the trees. Misra Ram shows a receipt of Rs.200 dated November 2015. For electricity connections, we had to apply in groups of five. A hundred such forms have been sent from our village. I have applied thrice. But there is no progress, he says.All conversations with the villagers start and end with electricity. Its announcement and presence have fuelled aspirations long bottled up.Back in Salam Singh Ki Basti, Abdul Khan shakes his head, disgruntled with the governments solar-powered electricity scheme that is oddly restrictive as well as liberating. We wanted electricity powered by the grid. The current set-up limits us to a few predefined utilities. There is nothing more that we can do with this, he says. The power limitation of the solar kit doesnt allow them to use other appliances. Unlike in Tanwarpura, electricity in this village doesnt match aspirations. Also, the government is advocating for one kit that fits all. This means that the village school in Salam Singh Ki Basti gets the same set kit as the houses. There are multiple classrooms, but only one fan.In the summer heat in Anandpur, 70-year-old Prasad dreams. Now that we have seen light, we have become a little greedy. Dil aur chahta hai (the heart desires more), he says. That means a few hours more hours of light. And a fan that will make the summer more bearable.The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining.

188,Vattavada bustling with activity ahead of Onam,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/Vattavada-bustling-with-activity-ahead-of-Onam/article14595318.ece,2016-08-28,The Hindu,"With Onam nearing, Vattavada, the largest cool-season vegetable producing village in the State, is buzzing with activity. Harvesting is in full swing and nearly 65 tonnes of vegetables are daily being sent to Horticorp and the main markets of Mettupalayam and Vadugapatti in Tamil Nadu.The main items cultivated here are potato, carrot, beetroot, cabbage, garlic, and beans. The high prices for garlic at Vadugapatti, the main market for garlic in South India, have kindled hopes among farmers as the price for the item has been fluctuating for the past three years, even reaching below Rs.20 a kg at times. Now the price ranges from Rs.180 to Rs.200 a kg. Garlic harvesting began by June end.Vattavada agriculture officer P.B. Shanavas told The Hindu on Sunday that 2,200 hectares of land was under vegetable cultivation this season, of which garlic was one of the major crops. However, potato continued to be the main crop, he said. Garlic price had touched Rs.400 a kg this season. Farmers cultivated the small-sized Mettupalayam variety, known for its high quality. One of the reasons for farmers shifting to garlic cultivation was the low price for potato last Onam season, due to a bumper production.Unlike other vegetables, farmers can keep garlic for three months after drying in sunlight. However, due to good prices, farmers now tend to sell it soon after harvest, said Thankaraj, a farmer. The garlic market was on Saturdays and Wednesdays, he said, adding that for butter beans and garlic, there was no market in the State. On a single day, about 130 tonnes of garlic is being sent from Vattavada.Better pricesActive market intervention by Horticorp is said to be a reason for farmers getting remunerative prices this season. At the Swayasraya Karshaka Vipani at Koviloor in Vattavada, potatoes were sold for Rs.23 a kg, carrot at Rs.25 and cabbage at Rs.15 .Beans items were also getting good prices with butter beans remaining the most-preferred item. Horticorp procures vegetables directly from farmers through the Vattavada Cool Season Vegetable Marketing Society. An official of the Horticorp said that the agency was procuring vegetables without grading them so that the produce would get a better price. Horticorp procured vegetables twice a week. Of the 65 tonnes of vegetables reaching the market, the agency procures only 5 tonnes. Lack of storage facilities is stated to be the reason for low procurement. The vegetables produced here directly go to the markets in Tamil Nadu. Farmers say they get the prices of vegetables procured by Horticorp in a week and hoped the agency would procure more vegetables in the coming days.2,200 ha under vegetable cultivation in VattavadaHorticorp procures only5 tonnes a day"

The marketing department of the state government has decided to ensure that the farmers get a fair deal. Marketing minister T Harish Rao asked the department officials to procure tomatoes for Rs 5 a kilo through the Mana Kuragayalu (Our Vegetables) scheme of the state government. The marketing department has also decided to set up special counters for the farmers who want to sell tomatoes at Rythu Bazaars, where the tomatoes will be available at Rs 7 per kilo. The marketing department has conducted a survey of the tomato produce available in the state and has already procured 300 quintals of the produce through the 16 procurement centres.Tomatoes are predominantly grown on the outskirts of Hyderabad,in Medak district and also in Mominpet, Nawabpet, Chevella and Yacharam areas in Rangareddy district.Potatoes to be procured tooThe government has also decided to procure potatoes directly from farmers as the rates of the vegetable have fallen drastically.""While the wholesale price is around `500 per quintal, the marketing department will procure a quintal of potatoes for `800 directly from the fields of the farmers,"" an official release said.The move is aimed at ensuring that the farmers save them the trouble of investing in transportation, hamali charges and commissions to agents."

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe price of tomatoes has been dipping in Vellore, touching as low as Rs. 5 per kilo this week.After soaring to almost Rs. 80 per kg a few months ago, the price of tomatoes dropped to Rs. 20 and this week, it came down to Rs. 8 and then to Rs. 5. This is because of an increased supply due to the high yield in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.A major chunk of tomatoes that arrives at Vellore comes from Andhra Pradesh. The drop in prices might be good news for consumers, but it is not so for shopkeepers.Selling tomatoes at such low rates is not profitable for traders. As the supply is more, tomatoes are available everywhere. So, if it does not sell well, vendors end up selling the produce for cheaper rates, keeping in mind that it perishes quickly, he said.And, its not just tomatoes. The prices of most vegetables have come down, he said. The popular thorny brinjal, which is locally produced, is priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while brinjal varieties from Andhra Pradesh and Ottanchatiram in Dindigul cost Rs. 6-7 this week.Onion costs Rs. 5 to Rs. 15 a kg, while potato costs Rs. 20 -Rs. 25.The cost of other vegetables is: ladiess finger (Rs. 10), beans (Rs. 15), carrot (Rs. 20-Rs. 30), avarakkai (Rs. 20), beetroot (Rs. 15), cabbage (Rs. 10-Rs. 15), peas (Rs. 50-Rs. 60), drumstick (Rs. 20), snake gourd (Rs. 15), bitter gourd (Rs. 20), radish (Rs. 15), ginger (Rs. 40 (new) and Rs. 60 (old)).

We have urged them to allow central agencies like Nafed and SFAC to export onions under the Price Stability Funds, which has been set up by the Centre to stabilise prices of select commodities like onion and potatoes in the country. The government will bear losses, if incurred, during export, but on the contrary, profit will also be added into the PCF account.""The source added, ""The government will give onion export target of 10 lakh metric tonnes to both Nafed and SFAC, which will help stabilise prices and save farmers from incurring losses.""Presently, onions arriving in the market are of summer crop are harvested in March and April. The summer crop has a shelf life of six-seven months. Hence, farmers prefer storing them in the hope of getting better prices later. Onions arriving in the market are four months old and the produce has started sprouting and rotting. Farmers have huge stocks of onions, but prices have declined a lot and they are unable to manage to obtain even the production cost. It costs Rs 1,000 per quintal to grow onions, but farmers incur losses if they get prices below that. Now, onion prices have declined in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 600 per quintal, causing farmers to incur heavy losses.During the last financial year 2015-16, the government introduced PSF for onions, potatoes and other crops with provision of Rs 500 crore in the budget. Last year, the government had created a buffer stock of 12,000 metric tonnes through central agencies like Nafed and SFAC. But the scarcity had compelled the government to import 10,000 metric tonnes through MMTC Ltd to meet the domestic requirement last year. For 2016-17, the Centre has made a provision of Rs 900 crore under PSF. This year, the government has already created a buffer stock of 15,000 metric tonnes so far through Nafed and SFAC.Meanwhile, the ministry of commerce has decided to give a grant of %5 on onion export, but pitching Nafed and SFAC for export of onions will help stabilise prices in the country."
192,Farmers told to purchase certified seeds for better yield,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/567783/farmers-told-purchase-certified-seeds.html,2016-08-30,Deccan Herald,"Chikkaballapur, Aug 31, 2016, DHNS: 23:32 ISTAction warned against traders selling spurious seedsFarmers should compulsorily purchase certified seeds from authorised traders for potato cultivation. Legal action will be taken against those traders selling substandard quality of seeds in the district, warned Deputy Commissioner Deepti Kanade.She was speaking at a preliminary meeting to discuss about potato cultivation organised by the Horticulture department here on Tuesday. The meeting was attended by the traders, farmer leaders and the representatives of the Horticulture department.Farmers should not go for low-quality seeds which are available at a cheaper rate and thereby compromise with the quality. This would only lead to low quality production and thereby bring in only loss for the cultivators. Only quality seeds can ensure quality yield and the traders should also sell only quality seeds. Usually there will be variation in the weight of a 50 kg bag of seeds. Slight variation up to one or one-and-a-half kg is not a matter of concern. However, a larger variation in weight should be brought to the notice of the trader, she said.District unit president of the Raitha Sangha Bhaktarahalli Bhairegowda said, For the last three years, the farmers from the district had been facing potato crop loss. It is better to take all the precautionary measures. The traders who sell seeds should also provide bills for the goods sold. Measures should be taken to halt the private traders who are engaged in the sale of low quality seeds.Not sufficientThe traders informed the meeting that only a couple of companies sold certified seeds. However, this was not sufficient to meet the demand for certified seeds that is required in the district.Senior Assistant Director of the Horticulture department, Munegowda said the traders from the district often purchased potato seeds belonging to a general variety from the farmers of Jalandhar. However, there are a number of seed selling centres which have been certified by the National Seeds Coporation in Punjab, which sell certified seeds. Our farmers can purchase from these centres also, he informed.The deputy commissioner said that a list of certified sellers will be handed over the Horticulture department. The traders can purchase seeds from these sellers.For the first time in Hassan district, certified seeds were distributed by the Horticulture department directly to the farmers houses, on an experimental basis. The certified potato seeds were sold at a subsidised rate and the department has supplied 2,800 tonnes of seeds. And there have been reports of good yield too from the district. In order to distribute seeds on the similar lines in Chikkaballapur, an aeroponics project has been created, informed Munegowda.The deputy commissioner said, The farmers should transplant the potato plants during the period which is most suitable and recommended by the scientists and the traders should not sell the seeds before the stipulated time, she said.The potatoes, if cultivated between 18 and 22 degree celcius, will give a good yield. Such warmth in the atmophere is reported in the September-October months in Chikkaballpur. Hence, the potato produce should be transplanted between October 15 and Novermber 30, according to the experts, Kanade informed.A few traders informed the meeting that the sale of seeds had already begun at Bangarpet in Kolar district. Most of the farmers from Chikkaballapur were visiting Bangarpet to purchase the seeds. This should be avoided.Kanade assured them that she would be speaking with Kolar deputy commissioner in this regard.Biggest centreThe district has the biggest potato seeds producing centre. But so far, it has not produced any seeds at all. The centre should start the production of seeds and provide them to the farmers, the meeting was informed.Taluk unit president of the Raitha Sangha Maralukunte Ramanjinappa, joint secretary C B Shrinivas, leaders S Eshwarachari, S Ramesh, Taduru Manjunath, Potato Traders Association president R Vijaykumar, vice-president Ramaswamy, traders Prabhakar, R H Narayanswamy, Venkatesh, Mohan Murali, Horticulture department deputy director B Raghu, APMC secretary Ramdas, Agriculture Marketing department assistant director Bathula, tahsildar and several others were present on the occasion."
193,1 lakh quintal of potato seized,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/1-lakh-quintal-of-potato-seized/articleshow/53975271.cms,2016-09-02,The Times Of India,"Guwahati: Kamrup district administration has seized close to one lakh quintal of potato, almost equal to the requirement for 100 days, in Guwahati city. The haul is suspected to have been hoarded by unscrupulous traders in two cold storage facilities.Price of potato in the open market is currently hovering around Rs 25-28 per kg, when the selling price should have been Rs 14-15. Kamrup district deputy commissioner Vinod Seshan said, ""We are releasing the potato to the government's fair price shops (Amaar Dukaan), where it will be sold at Rs 14.50 per kg in Kamrup district and Rs 15 per kg in Kamrup (Metro) district. We have written to the government to allow us to release the potato in all PDS stores.""The cold storage facilities are for farmers to store their products. They have to pay rent for the storage and the quantities stored have to be recorded at the facilities. But, at the two private storage facilities where the potato have been found, there were no records showing where the potato came from and no agreement to establish that farmers have sold off the stuff to the owners of storage facilities."

""Vegetables from rural areas are not coming to the city market. Some vendors are selling on the outskirts by purchasing from farmers and some farmers are directly selling vegetables in the city. Due to these factors, there is less availability of vegetables in the wholesale market,"" he said.However, the price of green chili has come down. The prices of flowers too have increased in the past two days. Sevanti and mogra are sold at price Rs 50 and Rs 35 respectively."

That's changing now as village youths head for the cities to find better paying work in services and factories.Experts say the shortage of farm labour and its rising cost are among the main reasons for the increasing mechanisation of Indian farming. ""This is not restricted to pockets but spread all across,"" said T R Kesavan, chairman of the technical committee and immediate past president of Tractor Manufacturers' Association. While tractors still outsell other farm equipment like power tillers and combine harvesters, the gap has closed in recent years.The market for specialised machinery, such as threshers, rotavators, transplanters, reapers, zero till drills, laser levellers and power weeders, is worth Rs 32,000 crore now, said Surendra Singh, technical adviser to industry body Agricultural Machinery Manufacturers' Association (AMMA). He added that the industry could touch the Rs 37,000-40,000 crore level in three-five years, growing at its present yearly rate of 5-8%. That will make it as large as the tractor market is now.""Currently, the tractor market is around Rs 40,000 crore while the implements market is around Rs 32,000 crore,"" said Singh.While local players like Tirth Agro Technology that makes Shaktiman brand of implements have cornered 85-90% of the market in the initial shift to mechanisation, the organised players have started paying closer attention to this segment. ""Till recently, the segment was reserved for the small-scale sector,"" said Kesavan. ""Now that it has been thrown open, technologically superior implements and equipment will be introduced.""Tractor market leader Mahindra & Mahindra, for instance, has acquired 33% stake in Mitsubishi Mahindra Agri-Machinery and 35% stake in Finland-based Sampo Rosenlew, which, analysts say, will increase its presence in the agri-implements business in India.Similarly, tractor major Escorts is considering a more significant presence in this market. Ravi Menon, CEO of Escorts' agri-machinery business, said, ""Currently we have tie-ups to pick up implements as part of the total solution package we offer our customers, but we are evaluating options.""German company Lemken and Italian Maschio Gaspardo have set up manufacturing facilities in India. Grimme India, another MNC subsidiary, is offering implements for potato crops. Experts say it's a matter of time before other big global players enter the field as India is a vast opportunity.The size of the global implements business is estimated to be $131 billion in 2018.The migration of unemployed village youths to cities is unlikely to stop now. ""The younger generation is shunning farming because it feels it is a menial job and the remuneration is not commensurate with the effort put in,"" said Kesavan, adding that, ""Studies have shown that 50% of India's population will live in urban areas by 2030. This migration from villages to cities will lead to a lot of proxy farmers taking care of multiple plots of land. When you have large landmasses, you have to mechanise.""Farmers' push for higher crop density is also driving the increasing use of farm implements. It is expected to increase yields by 25-30% in states with a low level of mechanisation at present, and by up to 10% in states like Punjab that are already highly mechanised."
196,Willing to sell now,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160907/jsp/bengal/story_106766.jsp,2016-09-07,Telegraph,"Singur farmers Sanjoy Kumar Dey, Jamini Karmakar. (Pradip Sanyal) Singur, Sept. 6: Sanjoy Kumar Dey has had a change of heart, but it has taken a decade. Dey, a farmer in Singur's Gopalnagar, had fiercely resisted attempts by the government to acquire his two bighas for the Tata Nano project. Although many of his neighbours had accepted compensation, the 55-year-old farmer had held on in the face of alleged police torture and threats. A decade later, Dey, one of Singur's ""unwilling"" farmers, plans to sell his land for a ""good price"" once it is returned to him. Many of Singur's unwilling farmers, who had been the foot soldiers of Mamata Banerjee's anti-land acquisition agitation, feel the same. Dey said he was no longer sure whether his plot, tucked in one corner of the project area behind huge factory sheds, would be cultivatable again. A mixture of bricks, mortar, iron and stone chips may have changed the texture of the soil that once used to yield a rich harvest of paddy, potatoes and jute, he said. ""We need money,"" Dey said as he walked around the heavily guarded main entrance gate of the abandoned Tata Motors project site. ""Mamata (his wife) and I have endured a lot of pain to survive after our land was taken over. Now, we run a small roadside eatery."" ""If we get a good price, we might sell the land to a realtor or a developer. But first, let's get back the land,"" Dey said. As the initial burst of euphoria in the aftermath of the Supreme Court order on the return of the Singur land wore off, many landlosers are waking up to realities and are considering selling their land. A bachelor in his fifties, Jamini Karmarkar of Berabari, who jointly owned five bighas with his two brothers, is in the throes of a dilemma. Age has caught up with him, Karmakar said, and he was not certain whether he or his nephews would return to farming. Karmakar and his family, who used to cultivate paddy and potatoes, now run eateries and grocery stores. In Singherbheri, Beraberi and Gopalnagar, many farmers are thinking whether selling their land once it is returned would be a better idea than resuming cultivation. First, most are not sure whether the new generation in Singur would like to return to farming. Second, the rise in the prices of fertilisers, seeds and diesel used in pumps have eaten into farmers' income. Third, the character of the land has changed because stone chips, concrete and sand have been mixed with it and construction has been done, rendering the plots unfit for cultivation. Although the government has said it will return cultivable land, doubts remain. Fourth, the government will have to set up submersible pumps and deep tube-wells to ensure water is available for farming. ""Would the government spend so much on building infrastructure?"" asked Joydeb Ghosh of Gopalnagar. ""The land has been lying unused for over 10 years now."""

On the first day of procurement on Wednesday, it collected 90 tonnes of vegetables.However, farmers at Kanthallur are up in arms against the delay in payments for earlier procurements and the low prices fixed for vegetables. P.T. Mohandas, president of the Kanthallur Cool-Season Vegetable Producers Marketing Society which procures vegetables from the farmers, said private traders were giving farmers a higher price and only 250 kg of garlic was procured by Horticorp from Kanthallur.There are allegations that vegetables grown on estates are reaching the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralams (VFPCK) market at Kanthallur to be procured by Horticorp.Horticorps procurement prices fluctuated throughout the day, which was a concern for the farmers. Following their protest on Wednesday, Horticorp decided to fix prices for vegetables for the day from Thursday. The prices fixed on the day for a kg of carrot was Rs.27.50, cabbage Rs.15.40, potato Rs.26.40, beans Rs.31, and garlic Rs.135. A Horticorp official on Thursday said procurement would continue till September 11. He said there was no basis for the allegations that the prices fixed by private traders were higher than those fixed by Horticorp. It is Horticorps intervention that ensured fair prices for the farmers, saving them from exploitation by middlemen, he said.Large-scale arrival of vegetables was reported on Thursday from Vattavada, the main market. Jayaprakash, president of the Vattavada Cool-Season Vegetable Producers Marketing Society, said Horticorp had paid all dues. Farmers received better prices this season."

Others, taking a rather unkind view, said being a regular marijuana user he should not have stopped, which he has for the duration of the campaign.Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico, is a two-time presidential candidate, he ran in 2012 as well.

In manufactured items, WPI for sugar rose by over 35% . The increase in WPI comes on the back of an easing consumer price inflation (CPI) in August. The official data showed CPI eased to 5.05% in August, compared with 6.07% in July.Two indicesThe divergence in the WPI and CPI is because of the weightage given to items such as food in the two indices. Food prices form a large part of CPI. The August CPI fell on the back of a decline in food prices.But, inflation in both the indices is above the inflation target set by the Monetary Policy Framework. The Monetary Policy Framework, signed by the RBI and the government, retained inflation target at 4%, plus-or-minus, two percentage points.Policy responseIndia Inc, which apprehended that inflation will spike in the coming months, urged the government to take a concerted policy response.Assocham said that prices of products like pulses, potato and fibres, which are of national interest, have been rising at an industry level, but a recent concern is sugar, which has begun to rise at a much higher rate, and that which policymakers should address using supply-side responses.The government should take steps to address the structural issues of demand and supply within the industry to maintain the inflation within the target range continuously for at least six months, it said.However, deflationary trend continued in some items like petrol at (-)8.65% and minerals (-)3.44%. The inflation print for manufactured articles read at 2.42% in August, up from 1.82% in July.Rating agency Icra further said that core-WPI inflation is expected to inch up further in the coming months and remain in a range of 0.5-2% in the remainder of this fiscal."

While members of both the communities were conspiring against each other, Sauqat was busy discharging his duty for the mankind.The youths were crying in pain when they arrived at the hospital. I cleaned their wounds and covered those with bandage after nurse applied medicines, he said.On the strife, Sauqat said people from both the communities live peacefully in the town. Some mischief mongers flared up the small incident, he added. Normally, Soro is a peaceful town and people here extend cooperation to each other, Sauqat added.Doctors of the CHC also donned role of Samaritans for the patients and their attendants who were stuck up without food due to promulgation of prohibitory orders and curfew. A team of four doctors led by Dr Dhiresh Kumar Sarangi spent from their own pocket and provided cooked food to at least 200 persons daily for the last four days.The patients and their attendants were helpless since all hotels were closed as Section 144 of CrPc was clamped in the town. Even vegetables were also not available, we managed to collect dal, some vegetables and rice to provide them cooked food, said Dr Sarangi.Other doctors who extended a helping hand are Dr Satyanarayan Nayak, Dr Hemanta Roul and Dr Gauranga Singh. With the situation in Soro improving and no untoward incident reported since last 24 hours, the contribution of the hospital doctors and Sauqat is hailed by all and sundry.Meanwhile, the locals residents, who were forced to remain indoors due to prohibitory orders, came out and purchased essential commodities and vegetable which were made available after four days. People alleged that the traders were raking in the moolah as very few shops were opened and commodities were insufficient. Some were seen selling potato and onion at ` 40-a-kilo while the price of other vegetables were very high compared to other markets in the district. Fishes and chickens were sold like hot cakes.A district official said only a few truck loads of potato, vegetables and fishes reached Soro on Wednesday. The price was high since the supply was less but it will come down in a day or two, he added."
203,Decline in area under GM crops is more of an aberration than a trend reversal,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/decline-in-area-under-gm-crops-is-more-of-an-aberration-than-a-trend-reversal/,2016-09-15,The Times Of India,"The world of GM crops witnessed a starling development in 2015. According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a forum for disseminating and sharing technologies for agriculture sustainability and development, the acreage under GM crops declined for the first time after the commercialisation of GM crops in 1996.The acreage under GM crops, also known as genetically modified or transgenic crops, which had steadily grown to touch peak levels of 181.1 million acres in 2014, dropped by one percent to touch 179.7 million hectares in 2015. This was mainly on account of the fall in acreage under important GM crops like Maize and cotton. This is a major setback because acreage under GM crops had shot up almost 100 fold from the meagre 1.7 million hectares in the last 19 years, making it the fastest adopted agriculture technology in recent times.Latest estimates show that GM crops were raised on 28 countries which is home from 4 billion people of which 8 were developed countries and the rest from the developing world. However the bulk of the 180 million hectares under GM crops were concentrated in five countries which accounted for 90% of the acreage and included the United States (39%), Brazil (25%), Argentina (14%) and India and Canada with 6% each. However, in China the most populated nation which stood 6th in the hierarchy, the share of GM crops was a mere 2% of the global total. But what is exceptional is the acreage under GM crops in developing countries has exceeded that of developed countries for the fourth consecutive year which raises hopes of increasing its acceptability in poor countries.In the United States the vast majority of the GM acreage was under three crops namely maize, soybean and cotton where the high technology variety covered more than 90% of the sown area each. The scenario was similar in Brazil and Argentina too where the three were the most popular GM crops. In Canada the largest GM crop was Canola followed by maize and soybean while that in India was mainly cotton. In China too cotton reigned supreme followed by papaya.The United States not only had the largest acreage under GM but also had the most diversified one. The number of GM crops including, apart from Maize, soybean and cotton, also canola, sugar beat, alfalfa, papaya, squash and potato. And 2015 was also a notable year for GM crops in the United States as it commercialised a new strain of potato and a new version of canola and secured approval for two varieties of apple.The year was also important for United States as salmon secured approval to become the first GM animal for commercial production. It also secured approval for a new GM chicken. The GM community also was able to foil efforts to introduce labelling for GM crops in four states. However, despite all this it was the fall in acreage of 2.2 million hectares under maize, cotton and Canola, due to the falling prices that cause the global acreage to fall for the first time.A country attempting a significant push to GM crops among developing countries is Bangladesh. Though the commercial acreage is still low the area under bt-brinjal has been doubled to 25 hectares and efforts are on to exponentially increase the quantity of bt seeds to meet growing needs. The country has also stepped up efforts to initiate field trials of blight resistant potato in the next year and also initiated measures to evaluate crop like bt cotton and golden rice in field trials. All this indicate that the fall under acreage of bt crops is an aberration and would be reversed in the coming years."

With limited production of quality seeds, there is a huge gap between supply and demand.The Government Task Force on Potato Mission has estimated that the State's requirement of tuber seed at 1.2 lakh tonnes by 2017-18.The Government has been procuring large quantities of potato seeds from West Bengal, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh every year to meet the demand. This not only drains the State exchequer but also results in reduction of quality due to long distance transport.The Task Force had recommended for seed production to be done inside the State with private involvement. The potato seeds to be produced by UTIPL will be marketed inside the State and in Eastern India.The company will get 10 acres of land at Deras farm for establishment of tissue culture laboratory and 40 acres of land at Similiguda in Koraput for seed multiplication with usual Government rent for a period of 15 years.The company will establish the required infrastructure and seed multiplication at their own cost which will be around `20 crore, official sources said.However, the State Government will provide infrastructure support like road connectivity, electricity and water supply to the project sites."

We dont buy or sell; no middlemen and no franchisees; we just control production, Madhusudan, Chief Farmer, back2basics, told BusinessLine .Of the 180 acres, back2basics owns nearly 60 and the rest is leased from others. Contrary to belief in some quarters, agriculture is not a dying business. We have home-delivery in Bengaluru as of now and will soon expand to other cities . We also export and have access to 45 organic product outlets abroad.On 3.5 acres, he even offers experimental farming to his consumers so that they know how back2basics grows its vegetables.From fast-moving to farmN Balasubramanian, who graduated from the Institute of Rural Management Anand in 1989 and worked with the National Dairy Development Board, Godrej and some other food-related MNCs, always wanted to help small and marginal farmers. After having helped his friend Raj Seelam since 2004 in his Hyderabad-based organic products venture Sresta, he quit his lucrative job in the FMCG sector and joined Srestas start-up 24 Mantra Organic in 2010 as its CEO.We now have a network of 32,000 farmers producing 90 crops across 1.70 lakh acres in 15 States. We plan to expand to 1 lakh farmers and 5 lakh acres in the next five years.Explaining Srestas business model, he said the firm is not into contract farming. It helps farmers grow organic produce and pays market price for the produce. It currently markets across 145 cities in India, and has tied up with retail majors. It also has access to about 1,000 stores in 45 States in the US and has a presence in Singapore, Dubai and Mauritius.One-stop shopIndore-based Raman Singh Saluja has a slightly different story to narrate. For three years from 1995, he was into wind energy; moved to exporting potato and pulses to West and South Asia before he realised the gaps in supply chain in agriculture. This prompted him to start a web portal and supply-chain initiative called Gram Mandi.com but gave it up in 2000 due to APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) laws and poor web connectivity. He then returned to his family business of metal trading before finally, founding a start-up in 2010.His rural solutions company Gramco Infratech offers farmers end-to-end services under one roof  from sowing to marketing end products, except selling machines. It helps farmers with seeds, fertilisers, bio-fertilisers, chemicals, water solubles, and warehousing.

206,Untapped farm sector adds to Sundargarh woes,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2016/sep/27/Untapped-farm-sector-adds-to-Sundargarh-woes-1523403.html,2016-09-27,The New Indian Express,"ROURKELA: Almost like the industrial sector, the agriculture in rain-fed Sundargarh continues to suffer despite having huge potential to contribute to the States economy.Notwithstanding its large hilly terrains, Sundargarh has been a considerable producer of both paddy and non-paddy crops. But, lack of assured irrigation, agriculture infrastructure and direct market linkage to farmers are holding the districts agro-economy back.Sources said relying on monsoon, the district produces about six lakh tonnes of paddy from 2.13 lakh hectares (ha) in kharif season. Similarly, non-paddy crops are grown on one lakh ha including vegetable crops on 22,460 ha during kharif season as Sundargarh is considered one of the leading districts in vegetable production. It also produces horticulture crops like mango, banana and litchi besides huge amount of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) including mohua and tamarind.Senior scientist and head of Sundargarh Krishi Vigyan Kendra-II Jayant Pati said resource persons from College of Agriculture Engineering and Technology are educating NTFP collectors on value-addition of forest produces. To boost the agriculture economy, the farmers should go for high-value crops like sweet corn, capsicum, baby corn, pulses and oil seeds on upland. The district needs to enhance assured irrigation coverage to ensure double or triple crops in a year and develop infrastructure like food processing industries, cold storage facilities and provide direct market linkage, he suggested.Sources said of its 3.13 lakh ha cultivable land, the district has maximum assured irrigation for about 54,000 ha in kharif season while it is less than 20,000 ha in rabi season.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) RN Satpathy said Sundargarh has about 1.63 lakh ha upland. The farmers should do away with the risky paddy crops and go for non-paddy crops, he added.Citing his own experience of loss of potato crops in 2015, progressive farmer Bijay Xalxo said the district needs adequate cold storage facilities, direct market linkage, assured irrigation and food processing units.As of now, the infrastructure for farmers remains most neglected. A wholesale market yard in Rourkela proposed at an estimated cost of `98 crore is hanging fire for years while the only private cold storage on about 1,500 ha at Rourkela is not adequate.In May, Rourkela MLA Dilip Ray had written to the State Government for mapping of panchayat level potential to boost pulse production. Incidentally, Sundargarh farmers produce about 1.09 lakh tonnes of pulses in kharif season alone without any support."

Chilli and other vegetables grown in the region have a good market in Tamil Nadu.Thousands of farmers who have grown varieties of vegetables using underground water and by judicious water management have also given up harvesting as the prices have crashed.The farmers have grown bullet chilli, beans, cabbage, potato, brinjal and flowers in hundreds of acres expecting good prices in Tamil Nadu market during Navaratri season.Farmers in Bommanahalli, Attigulipura, Siddaiahnapura, Chikkahalli, Chatra, Ankashettypura, Ramasamudra and other villages depend on Tamil Nadu markets particularly Coimbatore, Erode, Salem, Mettuplayam and Madurai. They send around 8-12 truckloads of veggies through commission agents daily.With prices of chilli crashing from `25 to `7 a kg, potato bag from `750 to `400 and beans from `35 to less than `8 a kg, they have stopped harvesting.At a few places, the farmers have dumped chilli in drains and many of them are allowing visitors and villagers to take away bag full of veggies for free.A few manage to take vegetables in Karnataka-registered vehicles to the border and shift them to Tamil Nadu-registered vehicles by spending extra money.Nagrajappa, a farmer, said they would have got good money in Tamil Nadu markets if there were no Cauvery issue. The water sharing dispute has paralysed normal life in borders and cut off transportation.There are no takers for white beans, brinjal and tomato as the farmers have dumped truckloads of vegetables in Chamrajnagar and Mysuru markets. They are also marketing at Beggur market hoping that buyers from Kerala may come. I have grown cabbage investing thousands of rupees on pesticides. But, there are no takers now, said Kumar, a farmer.Vegetable commission agents have also pulled down their shutters as vehicle owners are not ready to take risk.Nanjundaswamy, a commission agent, said they have suffered huge losses and Cauvery issue has affected the farming community across the border the most.How can the farmers prosper if he has no market?, he said.Shivamurthy of Ankashettypura, shows a notice from a bank to appear before the court. He said about 55 farmers in his village are served notices and are told to appear before the court on August 29. How can I attend court spending `500-1,000 when I have no money to buy fodder for my cows? he said.He said banks have claimed `500 more for serving notice and alleged that these pressure tactics would only force farmers to take extreme steps.The stir has hit transportation of textile products to Mysuru during the Dasara festivities and it has delayed moving of black granite to ports in Tamil Nadu for the last two weeks."

A quintal of onions, which fetched farmers between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,500 last month, was being sold at Rs 500-800 this week.It is not just onion cultivators who are suffering. Potato farmers, too, are finding the going difficult with prices falling. With about 25 to 30 potato lorries arriving at the APMC yard every day, prices have fallen from Rs 2,200 per quintal last month to Rs 1,400-1,500 this week.Subhash Marihalkar, a potato cultivator from Kadoli, has urged traders to stop the supply of potatoes from North India.However, Manohar Mungari, a trader, says that potatoes are being sold at a good price. ""Once the stock arrives from Delhi, the prices of potatoes will fall further. It is a misconception that traders are bringing the price down.

Homemakers felt the pinch at city markets on Tuesday. ""I am not joking. Go on adding prices of the ingredients for shukto. It will come to around Rs 60 a plate.Prices of select vegetable items are more than that in Delhi,"" said Anita Mukherjee, who has come from Delhi to visit her parents at Lake Market. At Lake Market on Tuesday, potato (chandramukhi) was selling at Rs 28-30 a kilo, brinjal at Rs 40-50, bitter gourd (uchhe) at Rs 40-55, drum sticks (sajne danta) at Rs 100120 and kanchkala at Rs 10-12 each. Add to this the cost of oil and spices.A one-hour drive from Kolkata takes one to Tarakeshwar -the potato producing belt. Bags containing 100 kg potato are loaded on trucks at Rs 2140 per bag which comes down to Rs 21.40 a kilo for the chandramukhi variety .What makes potato prices soar by Rs 9 a kilo? The story is all about aggregators, hoarders, Puja organisers and a section of police officers who collect money from trucks as they pass through the 10-odd police station areas before reaching the wholesale market at Posta. From there, light vehicles carry potatoes to the retail markets in the city.Other vegetables are usu ally brought from North 24Parganas, South 24-Parganas and Murshidabad. Now, check the prices of vegetables like brinjal, ladies finger and bitter gourd at markets along the railway tracks from Sealdah to Santoshpur Sandhyabazar. Price of each vegetable is less by at least Rs 4-5 compared to the prices at Gariahat, Lake Market and Maniktala markets. For instance, ladies finger in Basirhat is selling at Rs 8-12 a kilo and the green chilli (Beldanga variety) at Rs 30 a kilo at Behrampore. But prices of these vegetables in Kolkata are at least three times high. The upswing has caught the attention of the state government. Prodded by chief minister Mamata Banerjee , the government task force on prices held a meeting at Nabanna on Tuesday to discuss on ways to monitor prices and see that they do not go up further. ""The prices at city markets do not seem to be a function of the demandsupply theory . Factors like hoarding, changing of multiple hands and hidden costs during festivals are behind the price rise. We will start visiting the city markets soon and inform the police in case of an abnormality,"" said a task force member."

(Source: Twitter/@BJP4India) BJP President Amit Shah. (Source: Twitter/@BJP4India)The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes in PoK, BJP president Amit Shah said today lashing out at Rahul Gandhi over his dalali barb at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Yesterday, wrapping up his UP kisan yatra in the capital, Gandhi had accused Modi of hiding behind the blood of soldiers and added: Unki aap dalali kar rahe ho. (You are cashing in on their sacrifice). This morning, Gandhi tweeted: I fully support the surgical strikes and I have said so unequivocallybut I will not support using the Indian Army in political posters and propaganda all across the country.By his khoon ki dalali comment, Rahul has insulted the Army, the martyrs and 125 crore Indians, Shah said.Dalali is what Congress did from Bofors to Embraer, from 2G to coal. Dalali involves some goods, what does he think this is about? Can one put a price to the blood of jawans?The morale of the very Army that risked their lives to destroy terror camps has been broken by him. I do not know what he was trying to achieve but the government, BJP and the people are standing firmly behind the Indian Army, Shah said accusing both Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of politicising the Army.The question is why you (Congress) are not happy, enthusiastic and proud of this, Shah said. It shows there is some fundamental flaw in youInstead of joining people in their happiness, the Congress party is with Pakistan in its despair.The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes, Shah said in reply to a question whether the strikes would feature in the BJP campaign in next years Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Zaroor jayenge, he said. I said at the very beginning that if some tehsil president had put up some posters (a reference to posters celebrating the strikes) that should not be taken into account. But we will go to the public because Army morale needs to be boosted and this achievement of the Army needs to be lauded. It was the achievement of the Army and the political will of Narendra Modi. Government was careful from the first day not to politicisethat is why the briefing was done by the DGMO and not by a political functionary, Shah said.Rahul Gandhis clarification in the morning did not cut much ice, Shah said claiming that BJP had kept all its poll promises  from securing the countrys borders and not allowing anybody to get away with beheading our jawans to one rank, one pension.Suggesting that those casting doubts on the authenticity of the strikes are anti-India leaders, Shah said, The whole country, BJP and its government are standing firmly behind the Army. We do not trust the anti-India rhetoric of leaders, we trust the bullets of our Army men.Gandhi, he said, should concentrate on potato factory, a swipe at this comments to farmers that they want potato factories. Shah also appeared to dismiss demands for releasing video evidence, saying who is seeking them.Shah brushed aside Pakistans denial. Then what was the special Pak Parliament session all about, he asked, and why is the Pak Prime Minister who comes to Islamabad only 3-4 times a month camping in Islamabad.As for Kejriwals remarks that India should counter Paks denial propaganda, he said that there is no doubt who is benefiting from his comments because Pakistanis are making him trend on twitter. The reference was to the hashtag PakStandsWithKejriwal that began trending on Thursday.Shah said Congress and Rahul Gandhi dislike Modi and recalled expressions like maut ke saudagar, (merchant of death) and zeher ki kheti (sowing poison) used by his mother and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi against Modi. The BJP won a two-thirds majority in Gujarat after maut ke saudagar and a majority after zeher ki kheti comments, Shah said, wondering how the latest statement will play out.He lauded the media for what he called its support of the government on its stand on Pakistan.Investigative journalists have dug out the truth from across the border, he said.

The lemon prices has seen a sharp increase in the last few days. Earlier, the lemon was available for Rs80 per kilogram, now it costs Rs150 to Rs200 per kilogram.APMC Surat secretary Nilesh Thorat told TOI, ""Every day more than 60 trucks arrive at the market yard from Chaklasi, Deesa, Anand, Kheda and Prantij. The transporters have hiked the tariff due to heavy traffic jam on NH-8 near Bharuch. This has led to hike in retail prices of vegetables in the city. There is a short supply of potatoes and lemons. Most of the transporters are not willing to come to Surat due to heavy traffic jam on NH8.""Rasik Patel, a vegetable wholesaler at APMC, said, ""If the trucks have to reach Surat early in the morning, they have to start from their destination a day earlier, due to heavy jam on NH8 near Bharuch.

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato cultivator in Kolar."

With output projections for the new season ranging from 220 lt to 235 lt, and expected consumption of 260 lt, the closing stocks for September 2017 would be anywhere between 35 lt and 50 lt  not very comfortable.Moreover, white sugar if imported today will cost well above Rs 40 per kg. That is more than the Rs 35-36 per kg that mills are currently realising. A clear picture  of the actual sugarcane available for mills to crush, especially in the wake of successive droughts in Maharashtra and Karnataka  will emerge by January.Either way, sugar is the commodity to watch in the New Year, when we also have the countrys largest cane producer Uttar Pradesh going for Assembly polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
219,Steep veggie price rise after mandi razed,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/Steep-veggie-price-rise-after-mandi-razed/articleshow/54820026.cms,2016-10-13,The Times Of India,"GURGAON: Retail vegetable prices have shot up in the last two days after Gurgaon's biggest vegetable market was razed to the ground by the government on Saturday.Experts speculate further price rise and rampant black marketing in view of the limited supply of vegetables in the city, unless the state government provides allots a temporary space for the Khandsa wholesale mandi to operate soon.Moreover, no respite from the sudden spurt in the vegetable prices is foreseen atleast until Thursday when the state agricultural minster meets the representatives of the Khandsa market association to discuss the issue.The wholesale prices of vegetables, including onion, potato and tomato saw a rise of 20%-30%, while cauliflower, bitter gourd, capsicum and beans have shot up by 30% to 40%. This has had a cascading effect on retail prices which, in case of patotatoes and onions, have shot up by anwhere between 50% and 100%.""I bought potatoes for under Rs 30 a kg on Friday. Today, the prices have gone up to Rs 50. Tomatoes and onions too have increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20. In Delhi, however, the vegetable prices continue to be stable,"" said Kavya Kohli, a resident of Sector 46.Increase in the prices of tomatoes and onions particularly has affected households.""We can opt for brinjal instead of cauliflower or beans instead of peas in case of price rise but we cannot replace essentials like tomatoes and onions. Vegetable prices generally drop with the arrival of winter,"" said Sanjeev R. Shukla, a resident of Sector 4.Vegetable prices, both wholesale and retail, soared within days of demolition of all the 175 makeshift shops in the Khandsa market on Saturday by the agricultural produce marketing committee. The space was cleared to set up an open-shed agricultural mall here.President of the Khandsa market association Inderjeet Thakran told TOI, ""While the authorities have razed the makeshift shops, they have no alternative arrangement in place to shift the wholesale vegetable market until the open-shed mall comes up. Vegetables in Gurgaon come from different parts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and even Bangalore. Wholesalers, who used to get 80 to 85 tonnes of vegetables everyday, have reduced the quantities to 20 to 22 tonnes for lack of space to store the produce. This has led to decrease in supply leading to increase in the prices.""""We have met all the senior officials and even the agricultural minister and chief minister to discuss the issue at hand. The agricultural minister has called us on October 13. We are only demanding a temporary place from where the wholesale market for time being. The income of over 10,000 families is at stake. Moreover, the common man is bearing the brunt of the government action,"" Thakran added.Agricultural experts feel the absence of the wholesale vegetable market may further increase the vegetable prices, leading to black marketing.""Retailers have already increased the veggie prices owing to decrease in supply. the government's decision to demolish the mandi could be affect the common man adversely,"" said Tarun Kumar Dhull, a city-based agricultural expert.Spread in an area of 2.5 acres, the Khandsa Market was set up in Gurgaon in 1984. Until it was demolished, the market received over 200 trucks carrying 300 tonnes of vegetables and fruits every day."

Besides, wheat became expensive by 7.01 per cent.However, onion prices were down (-)70.52 per cent in September this year, against the like month of the previous year. Overall vegetables prices came down by (-)10.91 per cent.The expenses on primary articles which constitute 20.12 per cent of the WPI's total weight rose by 4.76 per cent.Prices of manufactured products, which comprise nearly 65 per cent of the index, continued to rise for the sixth straight month, rising by 2.48 per cent in September. The prices rose by 2.42 per cent in August.The sub-category of manufactured food products, which includes sugar and edible oils, registered a rise of 11.21 per cent.This was mainly caused by a spurt in sugar prices, which rose by 32.92 per cent, as a result of production shortages. The cost of edible oils rose by 5.87 per cent.On the other hand, fuel inflation accelerated in September. It edged up by 5.58 per cent as compared to a 1.62 per cent rise in August and (-)1.00 per cent in July.Diesel prices continued to rise after seeing an uptrend which started in June after many months of consecutive fall.

These taluks should be declared drought-hit. Crops like potato, chilly, cotton, jowar and others have been damaged badly. The government should declare support price for potato and open procurement centres, he said.Pralhad Joshi, MP, said the State government had not yet released the crop insurance money for last year and they were citing reasons of duplicate loan accounts of the farmers as major hindrance.However, even after three months no measures have been initiated to set right this problem.The State government should start disbursing the crop insurance by Wednesday or else the BJP would launch an agitation, Mr. Joshi said.Mr. Joshi added that the State government should immediately hold survey to assess the crop loss and sent a proposal to the Centre.

Farmers from Sankarpur, Tarava, Gondia and Dinabandhupur and other pockets of Sadar block bring their produce to the towns market while potato is imported from West Bengal and Onions from Nasik.Civil Supply Officer Hadibandhu Sethy said, We have conducted a meeting with traders and asked them to keep price of onion and potato stable in daily sample study.

It served twin purposes -such demarcations will help owners to get the land as estimated by the Hooghly land records office, and the land labourers will get some crumbs of the government bounty . On Friday morning, Srimati Tudu, Bilasi Soren, Phulmani Kisku and Madan Ghosh from Gopalnagar joined work happily because they won't have to go to far off places to eke out a living.The Singur panchayat samity has engaged these day labourers under the NREG scheme on a daily wage of Rs 165 and breakfast. ""We are planning to give some money because the work is not too easy. The samity members at a meeting decided to begin the work with day labourers from Gopalnagar, Dobandhi and Bajemelia,"" said panchayat samity chairperson Pratima Das. The rural body has also devised a way to identify the bona fide day labourers from these areas and keep outsiders at bay. These labourers have got a certificate from the respective gram panchayat member based on which the block land and land reforms office has given them permission to enter the land. ""We are very happy. All of us had come from Bankura 22 years ago to work on the fields here.We have got back the right to work in Singur at last. We had a tough time looking for odd jobs outside Singur.The government once engaged us in road construction but we are skilled in agricultural work,"" said labourer Phulmani Kisku.The landowners, mean while, queued up in front of the block development office to get the land deeds after hearing.

This year, I will start with potato and cauliflower,"" Bagui said.However, those having land along the Durgapur Expressway are in two minds.Land brokers have already offered them a price of Rs 8 lakh a bigha.

This was aimed at improving the situation in the market. The move, however, is being proved to be ineffective as on the days arrivals are allowed, the market is being flooded by onions, said an onion trader at the APMC yard.Last year this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg and there was such shortage in supply that the commodity was imported from Iran and Egypt. However, the steep prices that onions fetched last year seem to have offset a cycle of farmers opting for onions in large numbers, which, coupled with a decent monsoon, ensured good crops across regions, leading to a glut in the market. We have seen good production across regions in Maharashtra and Karnataka and the markets are being flooded with onion, said Ravi Kumar of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur."
227,Nayagarh village that safeguards forest,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161023/jsp/odisha/story_115070.jsp,2016-10-23,Telegraph,"Ranapur, Oct. 22 (Reuters): For the tribal women of Gunduribadi village in Odisha, an early morning patrol is essential to conserve their forest, but what they are protecting goes far beyond food security or even their livelihoods. Four decades ago, logging and theft of commercial timber and bamboo had denuded hills, depleted groundwaters and dried up streams around Nayagarh district, forcing people to migrate in droves, said Arjun Pradhan, 70, headman of Gunduribadi village. The crisis prompted the community to embark on a campaign to nurture their forest and restore the ecosystem, he said. ""What you see today as Nayagarh's democratic movement to sustain community forests resources and become self-reliant was born of necessity 40 years ago after six droughts in 10 years shattered its farm and forest-based livelihoods,"" Pradhan said. Today, the revitalised ecosystem provides water all year round, with a stream irrigating small farms even in mid-summer, when pond floors dry and crack in many parts of India. The conservation plan is so successful it has become a template for forestry across Odisha, Arjun Pradhan said. Now the tribal women who conserve the forest are fighting for legal ownership under India's 2006 Forest Rights Act (FRA) law, which recognises forest-dwellers' rights over their traditional lands and resources. Government data shows that between early 2008 and July 2016, out of a total 4.2 million claims for titles filed under the FRA, only 1.6 million, or a third, were awarded. Out of this figure, just 44,500 titles were given to communities or villages, out of a potential 170,000 villages. Progress in implementing the law has been slow as India, one of the world's fastest-growing economies, seeks land for industrial use and development projects, land experts said. Across Nayagarh, a total of 850 villages protect around 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) of forestland. In 2015, Nayagarh's forest cover was 53 per cent of its total geographical area, more than twice that of India's 21.3 percent. In India, almost 150 million people in 170,000 villages live inside or on the fringes of forests, which they rely on for subsistence and income. There are just 27 households in Gunduribadi, owning barely a hectare (2.4 acres) of land each. But as rain falls on farms in the foothills of the village, it carries nutrient-rich humus from the forest, enriching the soil and adding to the bounty of crops and wild food. The soil is so packed with nutrients that each hectare provides around 6,500kg of rice each harvest, three times more than on farms near unprotected forests, locals say. The forest also provides a range of seasonal food for local families, as well as extra income from medicinal plants that can be sold at market. ""This forest is like an old friend that never fails to help us cope during droughts and bad crop years, saving us from starvation and (the need for) migration,"" Dami Nayak, a local woman aged 80, said. Another woman living in Gunduribadi, Janha Pradhan holds out a small harvest of sweet tuber, known locally as pichuli, which she collected on her morning patrol. For the 44-year-old widow on a meagre income, these wild yams are more nutritious than potatoes - and cost nothing. Such food is harvested carefully to nurture the forest. ""We never pull out the entire root but carefully cut out a portion and leave the remaining root beneath the soil to regrow,"" she said. The wild food includes bamboo shoots rich in protein, wild mushrooms, spine gourds and bean vines that proliferate on sturdy trees, as well as iron-rich spinach that wards off anaemia, a major health concern for rural women and children. While the women also obtain wood for fuel from the forest, they never chop the trees for firewood. ""On our morning patrol we break off dry branches and carry them home,"" said Kama Pradhan, 35. ""But we are selective, we know which species of wood does not give out harmful smoke."""

""But we are selective, we know which species of wood does not give out harmful smoke."" #Conservation is based on simple yet binding rules set by the village council, which permits villagers to collect dry shrub fuelwood, fodder and edible products sustainably, based on need. Felling trees needs permission, and taking axes into the forests is banned. Over the years, the plan has entailed sacrifices: as forests regenerated, goats were sold and banned for 10 years to stop them nibbling green shoots. The twice-daily meals of rice were cooked once to reduce fuelwood and let forests grow. A community policing system was introduced. Known as thengapali, it entails members of four families passing on the duty of forest patrol to four other families by placing sticks outside their homes at night. Gunduribadi's patrols say they are protecting benefits that are key to the future survival and wellbeing of the community. Despite protecting the forest with their lives - sometimes literally, when confrontations with gangs plundering timber or bamboo risk turning violent - most forest-dwelling communities lack legal recognition of land ownership. Activists say collective rights have been sidelined and that millions of forest-dwellers are still struggling with the complicated process of registering claims. They say that a 2015 law that outlines a framework for the use of compensatory afforestation funds shuts village councils out of the planning and implementation of afforestation. This will not only encourage the exploitation of community land, they say, but destroy the bio-diverse and climate-resilient forests that communities like Gunduribadi survive on."

Kadhar, a farmer, said .These farmers cultivate crops on less than four acres of land and depend on good yields to not only cover the expense of the lease amount, but also to pay for the next sowing season.However, this year has been especially hard for them , as the scanty rainfall has meant that they have had little water for their crops.Mr. Kadhar said that he has accrued a loss of more than Rs. 4 lakh cumulatively after his potato crop failed.I have used a tractor to level the land and prepare it for the next season, as we hope the rains will come shortly, he said.The farmer is preparing to grow radish on his 6-acre farm as they are more resistant to winter climates.B Kanagaraj, another farmer who owns a 2-acre farm nearby, said that it had been eight months since it rained in the village.Input costHe is now growing carrots on only a quarter of the entire farm as the input costs are too high. I spend more than Rs. 5,000 for bringing water in trucks to irrigate the fields every month.

231,Food on the go,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Food-on-the-go/article15897355.ece,2016-11-01,The Hindu,"Over the last few weeks I have been on a whirlwind series of travel for work and vacation  and I have taken all sorts of transport  flight, rail, bus, car, hikes, the works. For me, food and travel are inherently connected, like so many of us. And so, I found myself abandoning my Kindle to observe just how the nature of food we eat as we travel has changed.A toddler ambled across our coachs corridor, his beaming face crumpling when he saw his brother tucking into a packet of Kurkure. Kudkude, he yelled, his hand outstretched, trying to grab at that packet. His brother sulked as he was forced to share his precious stash, while the toddler settled into someones lap, happily nibbling at his Kudkude. He couldnt say Delhi  his uncle was trying to get him to say that, but he could say Kurkure. Priorities!On another train journey, a pair of tweens switched on their MacBook, attached a dongle, and promptly ordered themselves Dominos Pizza, after a fairly intense discussion about the toppings. The pizza, it seemed, was scheduled to reach home about the same time that we would all get home. Not to mention, it would be washed down by the accompanying bottles of cola. At the hotel we stayed in Binsar in Uttarakhand, a mother proudly told the wait staff that her son just loves Uncle Chipps, and no meal is complete without it. On another flight, the cup-o-noodles were what most families were ordering for their children.Our cities and villages are now dotted with little kiosks, where traditional local food such as podi idlis or banana chips are shoved aside by shiny packages of processed foods of all sorts. Our trekking guide at Binsar in Uttarakhand kept stopping to pick up remnants of such packaging that were littering his beloved forests, even though there were dustbins inside the sanctuary. Our walk in beautiful Andretta in Himachal Pradesh was strewn with packets of Uncle Chipps, Lays, and Kurkure, wrapped around plants and trees. All of this only underscores the many studies and research floating about  that Indians, including children, are taking to packaged and hyper-processed food with gusto. This, at great cost to our collective well being, including our childrens health.Many of us un-millennials (is that a word?) have fond food travel memories. Our family summer vacations would almost always commence with us lugging Milton flasks filled with ice and water onto the train. As the train trundled on, mum would produce crisp aloo nu shaak, potatoes cooked in their jackets Gujarati style, along with methi theplas, a dab of mango pickle, and of course dahi. In intervals, sev mambra would be produced, carefully stored in ziplock bags ordered from the USA aunt, as well as sliced fruits, and godpapdi. Yet now that weve grown up and have our own families, we dont always do that.Of course, as I grew older, I would often be embarrassed by this stash of food we carried along with us  whether it was to Baroda or to Cape Town. Its only now that I have come to appreciate the hard work that my mum put in, in the form of hours in the kitchen, to ensure that we would be well-fed through the trip.But then lets face it  all of this eating well takes effort and the burden almost always falls on the women of the household, unfairly so. I cook almost every day, but even the thought of producing that quantum of food is daunting for me. And its getting harder to trust street food  you dont know what oil or water it was cooked in, cut fruits and vegetables are a strict no-no, and it is often deep fried starchy food such as samosas, kachoris, or vada paos.Its not surprising that hard-pressed for time and with fewer healthier choices on sale, we are choosing to pick up ready-to-eats, convenience foods, outsourcing our food decisions to corporates. The difference is evident in the way we travel. We cant even be bothered to carry our own water bottles, preferring to buy plastic mineral water bottles instead. Who wants to lug about a steel water bottle when you can use and throw a plastic one. Never mind the environmental impact.Yet does it have to be all packaged, salty, additive-laden food that we need to pack into our travel schedule? Many of these food labels read like a sci-fi movie, undecipherable, straight out of a lab, rather than a farm. Now when I travel, I pack myself a sandwich or get my cook to make me a stack of theplas. Add some fruits and youre sorted for the journey. A friend carries homemade granola with her, another carries packets of puliyogare to mix into rice. On a trip to Madhya Pradesh, we looked at the unappetising train fare (no it wasnt the Shatabdi) and cheered up when a friend produced luchis and aloo sabji for dinner from her bags.

232,Should we be  scared of butter?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/579038/should-we-scared-butter.html,2016-11-02,Deccan Herald,"Should we be scared of butter?Jane E Brody, Nov 03, 2016, International New York Times 22:37 ISTUnless you have a medical condition that dictates otherwise, there's no reason to cut butter or ice creamIs butter, along with other sources of saturated fats, back on the table, as many have recently claimed? It is. Just not in the quantities the meat, dairy and fast-food industries might have you ingest.Unless you have a medical condition that dictates otherwise, theres no reason to cut anything  not butter, ice cream or Porterhouse steak  completely from your diet as long as you mainly eat plant-based food (vegetables, fruits and whole grains), lean animal protein and fish and dont go overboard on foods rich in saturated fats that can cause harm in excess.Thats the conclusion of the best available evidence Ive reviewed for maximising the health of body and brain and enjoying a long life. The unending controversies about a wholesome diet provide much fodder for this column.An extensively researched book by science writer Nina Teicholz (The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet), published in 2014, has raised serious questions about the evidence that nearly 40 years ago prompted the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs to recommend that Americans follow a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol to curb what was then a runaway epidemic of heart and other cardiovascular diseases.Those recommendations spawned an outpouring of low-fat and fat-free processed foods that replaced the maligned fats with carbohydrates, primarily sugars and refined starches, which the body treats like sugar.A result: Heart attacks and coronary deaths are way down (thanks largely to the decline in smoking and use of cholesterol-lowering medications along with dietary changes), but obesity and Type 2 diabetes have soared. So what should we do? Cut back on carbs and go back to eating lots of high-fat meats and dairy products? Not if you value your health. The task now is to appreciate the effects that different nutrients have on the body and adopt a rational and enjoyable diet that takes both health benefits and risks into account.Upon reviewing the newest reports, Dr Boris Hansel, a French endocrinologist-nutritionist who specialises in obesity management, wrote in a Medscape commentary: Butter is one of the foods with the highest saturated fat content, and consuming it on a regular basis promotes an increase in blood cholesterol levels.But, he added, It should be considered a pleasure food for those who are fond of it, provided it is consumed in moderate amounts and not consumed in addition to other foods that are high in saturated fatty acids.At the same time, a lot more attention should be paid to the overconsumption of simple and refined carbohydrates  the sugary drinks, desserts, pastries and snacks, as well as white bread, white rice and potatoes  that promote obesity and now threaten to reverse the decades-long decline in cardiovascular disease.Not all fats and not all carbohydrates are created equal, Dr Frank Hu, the senior author of a recent report on saturated fats, told me. The types of fats and carbohydrates are more important than the quantity.Hu is a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and a member of the nations Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee that last year recommended a diet lower in red and processed meat, which have been linked to heart disease and cancer.Saturated fat is still bad for heart disease risk, Hu told the Nutrition Action Healthletter, published by the Centre for Science in the Public Interest, a public advocacy group.Evidence from studies on thousands of people shows that if you replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, you reduce your risk of heart disease. If you replace saturated fat with refined carbs, you dont reduce your risk. Studies that seem to exonerate saturated fats often fail to compare their effects with the appropriate nutrients, Hu said in an interview.Furthermore, he claims that, heart risk aside, diets low in saturated fats do not prevent premature death have now been refuted by a huge observational study published online in July in JAMA Internal Medicine.With Dr Dong D Wang in Hus department as first author, this study of 83,349 female nurses followed for 32 years and 42,884 male health professionals followed for 26 years found that both total death rates and deaths from specific diseases like heart disease, respiratory disease, cancer and dementia were reduced among those consuming the least amount of saturated and trans fats, replacing them with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.Simply substituting 5% of calories from saturated fats with the equivalent amount of polyunsaturated fats reduced total deaths by 27%, and replacing saturates with monounsaturates (from foods like olive and canola oil, nuts and avocados) reduced deaths by 13%. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish also modestly lowered total mortality, the researchers found.Saturated fatsHowever, when saturated fats were consumed in place of carbohydrates, there was no significant drop in cardiovascular death rates and slightly higher death rates from cancer.Wang and colleagues wrote that this finding was not surprising because the major sources of carbohydrates in a typical Western diet are highly processed foods with large amounts of refined starch and sugar that can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of saturated fats.For the various diseases with death rates linked to diets high in saturated fats, chronic inflammation is believed to be a main underlying cause. Chronic low-grade inflammation promotes atherosclerosis, leading to cholesterol-clogged arteries and setting the stage for heart attacks and strokes. The same process affects arteries in the brain and can result in vascular dementia, a common cause of memory loss.On the other hand, a Mediterranean-style diet rich in olive oil and nuts but relatively low in saturated fats not only protects the heart but also has been shown to improve cognitive function and may reduce the risk of Alzheimers disease, according to a report from Barcelona last year.Diets rich in red meat and processed meats have repeatedly been linked to an increased risk of developing colon cancer. And an ongoing study of young nurses under the auspices of the Harvard School of Public Health is exploring evidence that higher intakes of saturated fats (as well as too many simple carbohydrates) can raise the risk of premenopausal breast cancer.All saturated fats are not alike, which is good news for chocolate lovers. Stearic acid, the saturated fat in dark chocolate, does not raise unhealthy cholesterol. And theres room for an occasional indulgence  if you eat healthfully most of the time."
233,"Wrong to outsource pulses, oilseeds production",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/579039/wrong-outsource-pulses-oilseeds-production.html,2016-11-02,Deccan Herald,"Wrong to outsource pulses, oilseeds productionDevinder Sharma, Nov 03, 2016 22:36 ISTAt a time when the country is faced with a massive unemployment crisis, the decision to invite BRICS countries  Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa  to cultivate pulses and oilseeds and ship it to India will only end up pushing more and more farmers out of agriculture.This will also add on to the growing unemployment crisis. With a minus 0.43% drop in job creation in the April-June 2016 quarter, India continues to be in the grip of what is called jobless growth.Renowned scientist M S Swaminathan had once remarked: Importing food is like importing unemployment. I had thought this was a loud enough warning and that the government would at least be careful in not deliberately destroying the tremendous potential agriculture has in creating gainful employment.But agriculture doesnt seem to be an area of concern for the government. Only a few days back, addressing the BRICS farm ministers meeting in New Delhi, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said ministers from these countries have agreed to promote production of pulses and oilseeds in their respective countries after India asked for help in meeting its shortfall in domestic production.This offers huge business opportunities to the BRICS countries, he added. Earlier, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan had also acknowledged Indias efforts to woo Brazil into cultivation of pulses to meet the growing domestic demand. Since Brazil has not been growing pulses, India even offered to provide improved seeds of pulses varieties.The move to outsource production of oilseeds and pulses to the BRICS countries comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had about two months ago signed an agreement with Mozambique from where an import of one lakh tonne of pulses will hopefully begin in two years time.He had promised to procure every grain of the legume that farmers would cultivate in Mozambique and at a price which would not be lower than Minimum Support Price (MSP). India had also been searching for a possibility to grow pulses in Myanmar and some other African countries like Ethiopia, Uganda etc.As if this is not enough, the government has slashed the import duty on potatoes from 30 to 10%; on wheat from 25 to 10%; on import of crude palm oil from 12.5 to 7.5% and on refined oil from 20 to 15%. Lowering the import duty means opening the floodgates to cheaper imports. Although reduction of import duties is justified in the name of taming food inflation, when cheaper imports come in, it is the small and marginal farmers who are forced to abandon agriculture.The growing reliance on cheaper (and highly subsidised) imports of agricultural commodities, including pulses, edible oils, wheat, apple, rubber, coconut, silk, fish, a horde of fruit products and juices, are linked primarily to the policy imperative that aims to drive farmers out of agriculture. This approach follows a directive from the World Bank way back in 1990s wanting India to move 400 million people from the rural to the urban areas by 2015.To achieve this, successive governments have been systematically squeezing public investments in agriculture and by denying farmers a fair and remunerative price kept farming impoverished. Cultivation of pulses is a classic example. Although the area under pulses cultivation has increased in kharif by a whopping 57%, and the production in 2016-17 is estimated to go up to a record 20 million tonnes, there still would be a shortfall by 3 to 4 million tonnes.Although the government has hiked the MSP for some of the pulses, the fact remains that it is the volatility in prices that discourages farmers to take up pulses cultivation. If the government can provide an assurance to farmers in Mozambique and in Brazil that it will procure whatever is produced I fail to understand why the same assurance cannot be given to Indian farmers?It is the lack of assured procurement that is the primary reason why farmers have been reluctant to take up pulses cultivation. Instead of helping the domestic farmers, the government is now outsourcing pulses production to Africa, Brazil and Russia.WTO disputeAfter India lost the WTO dispute with America over import of chicken legs, the poultry industry should be ready to take a hit. The dairy industry too is under pressure to open up to cheap imports from the European Union, Australia and New Zealand. In fact, some mainline economists have been openly vouching for it.They even want the sluice gates to be lifted for vegetable and fruit imports, endorsing the demand that the European Union is making under the Indo-EU Free Trade Agreement. Already, apple imports are coming in from 44 countries.While on the one hand India is expected to protect its food security concerns as well as farm livelihoods at the international negotiations, the autonomous liberalisation that goes unheeded at the domestic policy level is likely to inflict a much bigger blow to the future of Indian agriculture.For a country which has 600 million people dependent upon agriculture, and given that urban employment opportunities are fast drying up, the challenge should be on how to make farming economically viable.Contrary to the dominant economic thinking, agriculture alone has the potential to reboot the economy. Outsourcing food production to BRICS countries, and opening up to cheaper imports will not only destroy food self-sufficiency but once again make India to stand with a begging bowl."
234,vegetable prices likely to soar before Chhath puja,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vegetable-prices-likely-to-soar-before-Chhath-puja/articleshow/55198081.cms,2016-11-02,The Times Of India,"RANCHI: A steep hike in vegetable and fruit prices has become the trend ahead of festivals here. With Chhath festival around the corner, prices of veggies and fruits have increased and are only likely to soar further from Wednesday.On Tuesday, the price of bottle gourd (kaddu or gheeya) ranged between Rs 20-Rs 40 at the local markets. Anita Devi, a vendor at Peace Road , said she and her friends are planning to sell them at a higher price since it is one of the vegetables eaten on 'Nahay-Khay'.Sunita Pradhan, a resident of Hinoo and who is performing the puja for over five years, said on the second day, Lohanda and Kharna, which is about a day-long fast ending with eating chapatti (roti) or pancake (puri) with rice dessert (kheer), has also become an expensive affair. ""The price of one litre milk is above Rs 30 and one kilo rice is also the same. We prepare the menu considering the diet of each family member and keeping our budget in mind,"" she added.At present, the cost of carrot is Rs 80 per kilogram, ginger Rs 100 per kilogram, radish Rs 10 per 100 gram, cauliflower between Rs 40-50 per kilogram, new potato Rs 25-30, old potato Rs 20 and pointed gourd is Rs 30-40 per kilogram. Most of these items, apart from fruits, are essential for 'aragya soop', which is offered to the sun god during the festival.Nannu Devi, another vendor near Raj Bhavan said rpices of vegetables will increase by at least Rs 10 or Rs 20 ahead of Chhath puja.Even fruits such as small sized local apples are available for Rs 50-Rs 80. However, sugarcane which is a necessary fruit offered during Arghya, was not visible in the market. Shanti, a vendor at Birsa Chowk , said sugarcane will be sold from Wednesday onwards. Mohammed, a vegetable seller at Doranda market, said with the onset of winter, prices of vegetables is usually high but post-Chhath, the prices are likely to slide as per the demand customers."
235,Target set for potato and onion farming in 3000 hectares,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2016/nov/03/target-set-for-potato-and-onion-farming-in-3000-hectares-1534482.html,2016-11-03,The New Indian Express,"ROURKELA: To augment the availability of potato and onion, the tribal-dominated Sundargarh district has targeted to cover around 2,000 hectares (ha) under potato cultivation and about 1,000 ha for onion in the current Rabi season.The distribution of seed potato is underway from October 26 while onion seedlings are being raised at nurseries. But farmers are seemingly discouraged to take potato cultivation due to high price of certified seed potato of K-Jyoti variety at `35.5 per kg.Sundargarh Deputy Director of Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu said the administration also plans to cover 133 ha in Gurundia, Rajgangpur, Kutra and Lefripara blocks under the convergence initiative of horticulture and watershed schemes. So far, 1,200 quintals of total 2,082 quintals of seed potato have been supplied and farmers in the four blocks would get incentive of `30,000 per ha under convergence initiative, he added.In the rest 13 blocks, potato farmers registered under Rashtriya Krishi Vikash Yojana (RKVY) would be entitled to get incentives of `20,000 per ha. He said a section of the farmers have resorted to germination of seed potatoes and sowing would continue till December in the district.About onion cultivation, he informed that 160 ha are covered under the State Plan Scheme and 16 quintals of seed onion have been supplied at a subsidised cost of `250 per kg. The DDH claimed that in rest of the district, farmers have taken up onion cultivation on 940 ha at their own and onion seeds are being developed at nurseries for transplantation after 45 days.Sources said sandy loam soil is most suitable for potato crop with each ha requiring about 15 quintals of seed potato and after 105 days, the average potato yield is expected to be 10 tonnes per ha in the district. Similarly, each ha requires 10 kg of seed onion and after 150 days, each ha is likely to produce 10 tonnes of onion on an average.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) RN Satpathy said to boost potato and onion cultivation, adequate cold storage facilities are required. He hoped the recently opened cold storage facility in Bargaon block of 5,000 tonnes capacity and an existing facility of 1,500 tonnes at Rourkela would be helpful to some extent.Potato farmers, however, continue to be worried about market uncertainties as in 2015, potato price had crashed drastically leading to distress sale of locally grown crops."
236,"Punjab: Despite ban, crackdown, burning is on",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-despite-ban-crackdown-burning-is-on-3736431/,2016-11-04,Indian Express,"HEERA, A migrant labourer, was in a hurry to clear paddy stubble from the field of his owner in Kapur village of Jalandhar late on Thursday afternoon. So, he set the entire field on fire. He was also joined by the field owner, Mahinder Singh (name changed) as both wanted to clear the straw as soon as possible to prepare the field to sow wheat. Wheat sowing, which has already begun in the state, will continue till November 15.Singh owns 10 acres of land on which he sows wheat, paddy and potato every year. We have harvested paddy a couple of days back and now we are left with less than two weeks to complete wheat sowing for which fields are to be prepared and there is no alternative available with us to remove the stubble. To clear the field for sowing the next crop, we have to burn the straw, he insisted.Government is imposing fine on us but not giving any solution on how to manage the straw. We do not want to spoil the environment as we too live in the same polluted environment, which we create by burning straw, but have no option, said another farmer.Ploughing the stubble costs us around Rs 1,500 per acre which is not viable and the government should support us in clearing the field as the machinery required for stubble management is beyond the reach of more than 70-75 per cent farmers of Punjab, said another farmer, adding that machinery required to manage straw is costly and without government support, it is not possible for majority farmers to use it.Despite the ban on straw burning in the state, one could see a large number of burnt fields and fires every 100-200 metres in Kapur village. It was the same at over two dozen villages in Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur districts that The Indian Express visited on Thursday.According to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, which measures stubble burning through satellite images, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials maintained that it has increased this year.According to agriculture department sources, out of over 20 million tonnes of paddy straw, which Punjab produces annually, nearly half has already been burnt. Around 70-75 per cent (nearly 15 million) of the 20 million straw is burnt to clear land for the next crop.This year, 30.10 lakh hectares are under rice cultivation against 29.75 lakh hectares last year. Now, the burning fields of Punjab have resulted in a dense smog cover over Delhi, for the past couple of days. Incidentally, the National Green Tribunal has summoned Punjab for creating environment pollution not only in the state but up to Delhi thereby resulting in serious health issues in the national capital.PPCB has formed several teams along with officials in every district of the state this year to take action against those burning straw and even booked over 500 farmers. They are being fined Rs 2,500, Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 for setting on fire two acres, five acres and over five acres, respectively. In Jalandhar alone, around 90 farmers fields have been raided by these teams.Our officials have already raided over 500 farmer units, said PPCB Chairman Manpreet Singh Chatwal.Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, Director of Punjab Agriculture department, said paddy is sown over a huge area in Punjab for which we have to make a large number of machines available to every farmer in the state. Though big farmers can afford to purchase machines on their own, that cannot be expected of the small and marginal farmers. So, the Centre has to help farmers purchase the machines at nominal rates. In Punjab, not more than 10 per cent paddy stubble can be manged with the available machinery. We are also changing the mindset of farmers through Kisan Mela so that they can adopt the new technology, said Bains. Though awareness is increasing, we still have a long way to go, he added.Second generation ethanol production plant in SangrurIndian Oil Corporation, in association with the Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion (PBIP) and the Punjab government, is also going to set up an ethanole plant by using surplus crop residue and other biomass as feedstock. Sangrur district has already been identified as one of the potential locations where surplus biomass is available. And this plant will reduce carbon emission produced by traditional burning of crop residue by farmers, informed Chatwal, adding that a 50-acre plot has already been identified to set up this plant, which will help to manage the straw as well as provide additional income to farmers, he added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Another private cold storage is likely to operate in a month is set to bring more cheer for the community.Administrative sources said there were no cold storage facilities in Sundargarh and Bonai sub-divisions and a private cold storage facility of 1,500 tonnes at Rourkela city in Panposh sub-division was the only option.Inaugurating the 5,000 tonne capacity facility in Bargaon block in the last week of October, District Collector Bhupendra Singh Poonia said another cold storage facility of similar capacity will be operational along National Highway 143 in Bonai sub-division. The administration is extending all possible help to private promoters to set up cold storage units and boost the agriculture sector. The farmers are also being asked to cultivate more cash crops like vegetables which would help them earn suitable profits and at the same time reduce the demand supply gap.However, a half-constructed private cold storage unit at Kirei of Sundargarh town has failed to take off allegedly due to the laxity of the promoter. The district administration has sought return of around two acres of land allotted for the purpose.Deputy Director, Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Barik said, private promoters are showing interest in setting up cold storages and a fresh proposal for Tangarpali block is under consideration. More promoters are evincing interest as under the Government prescribed norms a cold storage of 5,000 tonnes costs about `4 crore and the Government is giving a subsidy of about `2.8 crore along with 50 to 20 per cent cut on electricity bills for six years."

239,Linking food and nutrition security,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Linking-food-and-nutrition-security/article16217399.ece,2016-11-08,The Hindu,"The euphoria around the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, seems to have dwindled. As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"
240,Cash crunch triggers virtual trade shutdown,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/Cash-crunch-triggers-virtual-trade-shutdown/article16543915.ece,2016-11-08,The Hindu,"Traders across the country have been forced to virtually shut down their businesses following the governments surprise move to demonetise high-value currency notes and transition from a cash-based to a less cash economy.To improve the situation, traders have suggested they be allowed to accept old currency notes (of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations) with proper KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, with a commitment to deposit the notes in banks on the very same day. Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion from Confederation of All India Traders industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency.He added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to insufficient currency notes. The main market areas in Bengaluru were also impacted. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50,000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs daily, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association. He added, This is the season when Karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. We need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers.Note shortageIn Kolkata, Anupam Boral, who runs a small firm, Geetanjali Solar Enterprises, said the shortage of Rs.100 notes is also hurting business. He said he was finding it difficult to get five notes in Rs.100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the Central Glass Research and Ceramic Institute.In Coimbatore, confusion and misinformation prevail with regard to cash and withdrawal limits. P.K. Govindaraj, who has a foundry at the SIDCO Industrial Estate, went to the bank on Thursday to draw Rs.30,000 from his Cash Credit account, but was shocked when told that the maximum limit was Rs.10,000. He said, I employ 50 people and need Rs.80,000 a week for wages and another Rs.20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc.(Inputs from Pradeesh Chandran, Indrani Dutta, M. Soundariya Preetha & Arun S)"

It will include crops of Bengal gram, wheat and vegetables. Madhya Pradesh is the top producer of Bengal gram, while it ranks fourth in terms of wheat production in the country. Bengal gram and wheat are the main winter sown crops of the state.A top agriculture department official said, ""Rabi crops are being sown progressively well and acreage for Bengal gram is seen higher this season as prices are very high and overall weather is favourable.""In the spot market, Bengal gram is trading at around Rs 11,000 quintal as against Rs 5,000 quintal in the same period, local traders said.Farmers had sown rabi crops under 2.22 lakh hectares in Indore district last year. Besides, Bengal gram and wheat, they expect acreage under potato and garlic to increase this season.The agriculture department official said, ""In vegetables, potato is the main crop of the region and the area under sowing is likely to expand for potato and garlic as they require less water and rates are also attractive."""
242,Irrigation Projects: Cabinet revises policy for cost escalations,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/cabinet-revises-policy-for-cost-escalations-4365174/,2016-11-09,Indian Express,"Girish Mahajan (File Photo) Girish Mahajan (File Photo)The Maharashtra cabinet has revised the policy for approvals to cost escalation for major irrigation projects. Water Resources Minister Girish Mahajan said revised administration approvals (RAA) wont be required now for projects where the variation in cost over the approved cost was below 15 per cent. The government has further ruled that increase in costs for acquisition of land and rehabilitation of the project affected, and expenditure incurred for acquisition of forest lands wont be factored in while computing the escalated costs for irrigation projects.Watch what else is in the newsSources said this relaxation by itself would regularise escalated project costs for a majority of the projects stuck for the want of a revised administrative approval. As many as 200 projects are presently stalled for want of revised approvals. At least 150 out of these wont need RAA under the revised policy, said I S Chahal, Principal Secretary, Water Resources.Ever since the previous Congress-NCP regime was stung due to approvals for arbitrary cost escalations in irrigation projects, the revised administrative approval issue has been a political hot potato in the state. Mahajan too admitted that authorities responsible for issuing such approvals are wary of facing the heat for irregularities which were committed in the past. He said this had impacted the pace of projects.He claimed that the government had now specifically defined parameters that could be considered for ruling that the projects scope had been modified, and required a revised approval. The projects scope would be considered altered in cases where technical changes in the dam or canal design or water use and allocation resulted in an over 10 per cent difference in the projects irrigation potential, or where the projects construction cost, as previously mentioned, has increased by over 15 per cent. A revised approval will be needed for a project where the live storage potential of dams has increased by over 1 per cent.In August this year, the government had cancelled 94 tenders of 14 scam-tainted irrigation projects worth Rs 9,196 crore, which had been allocated during the previous regime. While Mahajan said fresh tenders would soon be issued for these projects, he admitted that the new policy for cost escalations would also be applied to some other irrigation projects where the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India had raised audit objections for irregular expenditure. The previous regime had allocated contracts for many of these without mandatory environment and forest clearances. Some were taken up without even acquiring the land required for the project.Meanwhile, for projects where the cost escalation are still considered arbitrary, the governments new policy has laid down a separate screening procedure, which include technical audits, ratification by a state-level expert panel, and project-wise reviews at the cabinet level.While the BJP has taken action against officials and contractors in scam-tainted irrigation projects in Konkan and Vidharbha after winning office, the government has drawn flak from certain quarters over its inability to turn tables on the slow pace of irrigation projects.On Tuesday, in another major decision aimed at revival of the irrigation sector, the government ring-fenced funds required for the maintenance of completed projects. Of 3,600 completed irrigation projects, maintenance of over 2,000 projects has been hit due to paucity of funds. This has adversely impacted the states water scarcity management plan, said Mahajan.The cabinet Tuesday cleared a proposal permitting non-deposition of revenues realised by water reservoirs through various means to the state governments consolidated fund. These would now be used only for irrigation purposes. The government has divested powers for irrigation management to the five statutory irrigation development corporations. These corporations will now be permitted to utilise up to 40 per cent of the revenues raised from dam projects in their respective areas for repairs, restoration, and maintenance works for completed irrigation projects. The remaining 60 per cent amount raised by each corporation would be deposited in a centralised irrigation management account, and are proposed to be utilised for special repairs and expansion of projects, dam security and safety works, strengthening and modernisation of water projects, revival of lift irrigation schemes, canal works, strengthening of water use committee, and training of personnel in irrigation management, among others.In another decision, the cabinet also divested its powers for decisions regarding water allocation from a dam. While reserving 75 per cent water in a dam for irrigation purposes, 15 per cent for drinking purposes, and 10 per cent for industrial uses, the cabinet has now allocated powers to a cabinet sub-panel to take such decision. The previous regime had courted criticism for large-scale diversion of dam waters for non-irrigation purposes.State protests sedition charges against Marathi youth in BelgaumThe state government has said it would be writing to the Karnataka government, protesting against the slapping of sedition charges and cases slapped against Marathi-speaking people in Belgaum.The move comes after the Shiv Sena raised the issue during the states cabinet meeting Tuesday. At the meeting, Shiv Sena minister Diwakar Roate even sought adopting a resolution demanding imposition of the Presidents Rule in Belgaum.While no such resolution was moved, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis reportedly informed his cabinet colleagues that an official letter would be issued to the Karnataka government, conveying strong dissent over the action against Marathi speaking youth since November 1, 2016.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

""Maybe tomorrow onwards, every two, three weeks, I will have to go the ATM or bank to get cash.""India's ""black economy,"" a term widely used to describe transactions that take place outside formal channels, amounted to around 20 percent of gross domestic product, according to investment firm Ambit.New bills of 500 and 2,000 rupees will be introduced from Nov. 10. Jaitley said it would take two to three weeks to replace the old notes, amid concerns over the availability of cash.POLICE ON ALERTDeepak Chhatoi, a salesman at a car varnishing store in Mumbai, said he had to turn away customers wanting to pay with larger bills, and could not buy the popular potato sandwich known as the vada pav.""I couldn't even have breakfast this morning because there seems to be a shortage of change in the market,"" he said.The extent of the impact of the measures became evident as petrol stations and hospitals also refused to accept larger denomination bank notes, even though the government had given them a waiver to continue accepting them.Meanwhile, bank ATMs were closed and banks prepared for a flood of people seeking to exchange larger bank notes for smaller ones.They will have to fill a form and show proof of identity to exchange no more than 4,000 rupees worth of the old notes at any bank, which is likely to cause further chaos.Swapan Mandal, a labourer, wanted to withdraw 3,000 rupees from an ATM and send it to his family in Kolkata, in eastern India, but was unable to do so.""I have only 500 rupees notes at home. I don't know if I will be able to send the money,"" he said.A sub-inspector in New Delhi said the police commissioner had issued orders to watch for disturbances, especially at key retail outlets like petrol pumps.""This is a sensitive time. We have to be alert,"" he said.TEMPORARY GOLD RUSHThe main opposition Congress party said it supported moves to attack the shadow economy, but that withdrawing bigger denomination notes would hit the common man first.""Modi shows how little he cares about ordinary people of this country - farmers, small shopkeepers, housewives, all thrown into utter chaos,"" said party leader Rahul Gandhi.""(All the) while the real culprits sit tight on their black money stashed away abroad or in bullion or real estate.""Indians raced to turn their cash into gold, which jumped nearly 4 percent to its strongest in more than five weeks as investors sought safety following Trump's unlikely win.India is the world's second largest gold consumer and around a third of its demand comes from the unaccounted sector.On Tuesday night, jewellers in Mumbai kept shops open until midnight as panicked people rushed to buy gold with cash, said Kumar Jain, vice president of the Mumbai Jewellers Association.On the stock market, real estate firms that depend on cash transactions were hit particularly hard, with DLF Ltd, India's biggest property developer, closing 17 percent lower.But analysts said the move would prove beneficial to India in the longer term, by ushering in transparency and bringing transactions into the formal economy, and providing additional revenue for a country that has long struggled to contain its fiscal deficits.It could also lead to easing inflation, raising the prospect of additional rate cuts from the central bank, which lowered the key repo rate by 25 basis points last month"

Officials are visiting the farmers, who gave up stubble-burning and adopted alternative methods on their own, to see the viability of the methods. The agriculture development department highlighted a new instrument made by New Gurdeep Combines, which is fixed at the back of a harvester combine. It trims the stubble into small pieces and spreads it evenly in the field.Nabha sub-divisional magistrate Jashanpreet Kaur Gill visited a farm to witness the technique at village, Ghanudki. Nabha agriculture development officer Jupinder Singh said that a farmer loses 21 kg nitrogen, 5 kg phosphorous, 50 kg potash, 60 kg sulphur, 0.7 kg iron, 0.75 kg manganese, 0.75 kg zinc and 400 kg of carbon per acre by burning stubble.Two farmers Bir Dalvinder and Ravi, who were present on the occasion, said that direct sowing of wheat through happy seeding has helped them retain moisture and nutrients in the soil.The new harvester instrument, that spreads stubble in the field, helps to restore the organic matter. After that, direct sowing is done preferably using happy seeder.Bir Dalvinder said that he had harvested 1 quintal extra yield per acre for two years by direct sowing without burning stubble. Ravi said that even potatoes could be sown after spreading the trimmed stubble in the fields.The experimenting farmers claimed that since the soil gets the organic matter from the stubble, the need of fertilisers and manures also decreased in their fields. Moreover, the above process of paddy harvesting has saved them around `2,000 per acre in the next crop, claimed the farmers. A lot of time is also saved as the sowing is done within hours after harvesting.Under trainee assistant commissioner Sandeep Kumar also visited the farm on the directions of Patiala deputy commissioner. The owners of the agro firm said that the farmers are demanding alternatives to stubble-burning, which motivated them to build such an instrument. Farmers are realising that stubble-burning is depleting environment for future generations, said Soni from New Gurdeep Combines, Bhadson. It costs only `200 per acre extra while harvesting, but a lot of fuel is saved in sowing, ultimately bringing down the cost of production of the next crop, he added.The officers appealed to propagate the method and also assured to bring it up with the government to provide support. Kisan union leaders and other farmers were also present during the demonstration.."

For weeks, if not months, those about to be married as well as their families were looking forward to this date with anticipation.However, the Centres decision to demonetise Rs 500 and 1,000 currency notes has rather soured their eagerness.My daughter is getting married on November 12. Who knew anything like this would happen overnight, without any preparation? People like us are in deep trouble for the moment. We withdrew money in bulk for shopping but most of the notes are of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 and no vendor or shopkeeper is ready to accept these notes, Manishankar Prasad, a government employee, said.I even thought about postponing the wedding. But that would have been another grave issue as the venues and other bookings have already been done. So the wedding is still on but the charm has gone, his daughter, Pallavi said.The Centres move has also affected venues and caterers.We can allow people to book the venue up to one year in advance, but cannot decorate it so far ahead. And now, basic things like flowers, bulbs, crackers and batteries are hard to buy as we are short of Rs 100 notes and vendors are not taking any other currency notes. Similar is the case with grocery and dairy products. Wholesale vegetable markets were closed on Wednesday and now we are in a do-or-die situation, Vikram Raghuvanshi, the manager of Bhopal-based Hotel Nandan Palace, said.The price of potatoes has skyrocketed after the Centres announcement. Yes, the prices will plunge back to their normal levels after three or four days but currently the issue is grave as the potato is one of the basic ingredients in wedding food, said Lovepreet Singh, a wedding manager.Others have taken a more pragmatic view of the whole situation.We have a wedding party today. Yes, there are issues with the preparations, but one thing is for sure the prime minister has done a great job. We should understand that this move is for our betterment. Thus, despite facing so many problems, I am happy because in the long-term, it will be beneficial for us, said Sudheer Sharma, the owner of Kanta Shravva Palace in Bhopal."

In fact, the historic Bangalore Club proudly claims this butterfly obsessed officer still owes the club `13 from an unpaid bill during one of his visits. The young Lieutenant was a frequent visitor of the Waverly Inn at Whitefield, where he is believed to have stayed on occasion. Rumour has it that during his visits, Churchill courted Rose Hamilton, the daughter of James Hamilton, who was the then owner of the Inn. The Waverly Inn still stands today, though it is now a private residence.Whitefield Arms incorporates this history with colonial themed wooden furniture and outdoor seating that makes for a quiet date night place.The microbrewery fuses Indian with British culinary skills in a menu that serves soups, burgers, salad, dessert and cocktails.The famed Madras pepper borth cooked presented in an Anglicised version is basically dal with an Angrezi tadka served as Mulligatawny soup that keeps it mild and easy on the throat.Their Cheddar Onion Soup is officially the best soup I have had ever, and I have had quite a few good ones. But this rich carmelised onion soup served with a gratinated cheese crouton absolutely won me over. To anyone visiting the place, forget the drinks, this soup is all you need to warm and please you up on a gloomy day. With the starters, while I enjoyed the crispy fried onion, the TWA Chips, Cheese and Gravy, which is basically fries topped with dal makhani, cheese, chopped jalapenos, green chillis and onions isnt exactly the kind of fusion cuisine Id vote for.To the pea lover, the chef does bake a mean Filo Parcel with peas and corn that is served with tomato fenugreek sauce and stir fried vegetables. The filo is buttery and flakes in melting into your mouth, with peas and corn to compliment the creamy crunch. The tomato fenugreek sauce is also used as a base for Pan Seared Vegetable and Yogurt Cakes. The dish is a combination of stuffed grilled galettes with hung curd served with a tomato fenugreek sauce, stir fried vegetables and truffle mushroom rice.Loved the mushroom rice, but the acidity of the yogurt cake and the tomato fenugreek sauce wasnt a pleasing combination, probably a basic potato substance would have lifted this dish. The mini burger is cuteness overload with the size and the miniature stuffing, the taste? Well, still dreaming about the onion soup here.But then, desserts happened. And oh my, all my dreams of an Eclairs fantasy came true. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a rich cake soaked with a thick sticky toffee sauce topped with vanilla ice cream.The Lemon Meringue Pie is a classic citrus dessert done right, with a creamy toasted meringue.Among cocktails, along with a rather cheery bartender, the Lavelle, Air Mail, Mountbatten and Colonial. Each cocktail has a story to tell, with few in the memory of World War II heroes.My favourite? The Air Mail, this sparkling wine based cocktail wisely mixes Old Monk with honey and lime to make a soothy drink.Two things Id definitely recommend with Whitefield Arms is the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Cheddar Onion Soup and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh, and also the outside sitting area that resembles the restaurants you come across on a walk through the streets of Paris.(Approximate cost for two people `1,500. Place: Whitefield Arms)"

They have a new menu to celebrate their fifth anniversary in India.Walking into the dimly lit restaurant on the fourth floor of a mall, I am surprised by the burst of colours on the table. Two sets of bamboo baskets come to my table for starters and they open to reveal purple-glazed dim sums and bright orange dim sums adorned with caviar. The purple dim sums has chicken, coriander and chestnut fillings. The layer made of potato starch and wheat starch gets that tinge of purple from the red cabbage. The orange dim sum called Spicy Har Gau has prawns and bamboo shoots in it. The meatiness of the prawn with a faint hint of sour bamboo makes for a melt-in-the mouth dish. The purple one is a harmonious blend of Asian spices.The restaurant that believes in modification of authentic cuisines has modified quite a few. The Crispy Prawn Cheung Fun was one such and it is now the restaurants specialty. Cheung Fun or the Cantonese Rice Roll is traditionally served steamed but the twist here is the crispy layer of fried tempura batter that drapes around succulent prawns and black fungus. Warm soya is poured on top of the silky texture that gives the taste buds a sweet, sour delight.For the main course, we are served Pork and Shrimp Fried Rice and Roasted Duck Udon Noodles. The fried rice is the kind that you would have in a good Chinese restaurant, not much of a surprise, but then I am told the basmati rice has been soaked in Jasmine water. After that I get the taste of jasmine, stir-fried with pork, shrimp and prawns. The chewy Udon Noodles is rich in taste of duck and seasonings.It is a delightful and heavy lunch and they serve Jasmine Tea, to help us with digestion. It is a good idea.Then comes the desserts, the restaurants USP. What I always tell the guests, who are not up for a heavy meal, is this have the dim sums, skip the main course and go straight for the dessert, says Ajay, one of the staff. We are served Citrus Tart and Blueberry Pistachio Bar with Lemon Yoghurt Sorbet and Grapefruit Sorbet respectively.The desserts look delightful with an emphasis on the presentation. The yellow, round Citrus Tart and the Brown Pistachio Bar both are signature dishes. The Pistachio Bar has tiny macaroons, the kind of cakes Yauatcha is known to make it in-house. The Pistachio Bar has four layers -- the base is with grinded almond base, topped with a layers of chocolate, pistachio, blueberry mousse and blueberry glaze. The layers are firm and the sweet taste of creamy pistachio balances out the slightly sour blueberry. . The tangy Citrus Tart is a play of bitter, sweet and sour.The sorbet is a bonus show stealer. It is subtle, rich and creamy. The Lemon Sorbet tasted of lemon, minus the excess sourness that causes us to cringe, and replaces it with the taste of rich cream and yogurt. Same with the Grapefruit Sorbet. I must mention the Hot Toddy mocktail. If you have a bad throat, like I do, then this is what you should opt for. A good mixture of orange juice, pineapple juice and masalas. Youll need to hold the wine glass with a napkin but once you sip on it, the flavours seem to dance.(Approximate cost for twopeople `2,100.

248,Thorny issue of who will pay for climate damage simmers at UN talks,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/thorny-issue-of-who-will-pay-for-climate-damage-simmers-at-un-talks-4370035/,2016-11-11,Indian Express,"At the Paris climate summit last year, developing countries won a hard-fought battle to secure its existence as part of the new global climate change accord. (source: AP) At the Paris climate summit last year, developing countries won a hard-fought battle to secure its existence as part of the new global climate change accord. (source: AP)Bangladesh is set to make a splash at the UN climate talks in Morocco when experts and officials present a proposal for a national body to deal with the losses and damage the low-lying South Asian nation expects to suffer from climate change. The body, if established, would be a first among developing countries vulnerable to worsening droughts, floods, storms and rising seas  all threats to development in Bangladesh, where about a third of people live beneath the poverty line.Saleemul Huq, director of the Dhaka-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development  who chaired an expert group on developing a National Mechanism on Loss and Damage  said the proposal had been given to the Bangladeshi prime minister, who is due in Marrakesh early next week.Watch what else is making news:I am pleased to see that the government of Bangladesh is taking such a pro-active position at the national level on this important topic, Huq said.Loss and damage from climate change has been a controversial topic at the UN talks over the past decade, mainly because it asks a tough question: Who should pay to repair the harm done by planet-warming emissions? Aid agencies say loss and damage occurs when stresses made worse by climate change  such as creeping deserts or rising seas  are too severe for people to overcome. That can mean losing your home as shores and river banks crumble, no longer being able to farm a degraded plot of land, or even the disappearance of culture after communities are scattered by repeated weather disasters.Following push-back from industrialised countries worried about being forced to pay for the cost of climate damage, governments agreed in 2013 to create the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM).At the Paris climate summit last year, developing countries won a hard-fought battle to secure its existence as part of the new global climate change accord. But for that happen, they had to accept a stipulation that the loss and damage provision in the agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation  a demand from the United States backed by other rich nations.At the November 7-18 climate change talks in Marrakesh, negotiators are sparring over when and how to conduct a planned review of the WIM, which has had little more than a year to get going on its key tasks. They include setting up a clearing house for information on climate risk insurance and a task force on climate-linked displacement.HOT POTATOBut it is the financing of measures to address loss and damage that remains the key sticking point.Who should pay for it? The hot potato of responsibility is being moved around, said Olivia Serdeczny, a research analyst with Climate Analytics and an advisor to vulnerable countries on loss and damage. The sources of finance is an issue that remains untouched. Most of the discussions around finance for loss and damage have focused on providing insurance against disasters  a popular measure with rich nations.In June 2015, for example, G7 states announced an effort to increase by up to 400 million the number of people in low and middle-income countries with access to insurance coverage against climate-related hazards, by 2020. But aid experts argue insurance cannot be the only financial tool to help people faced with loss and damage.Harjeet Singh of the global charity ActionAid said insurance does not work well for longer-term shifts such as sea-level rise and melting glaciers. But there is a reluctance to move beyond insurance on the part of developed states in the UN loss and damage discussions, he noted.CARE International says the WIM should develop instruments that can generate $50 billion in new cash annually by 2020. Sven Harmeling, climate change advocacy coordinator for the development agency, said there was a growing awareness that other types of funding would be needed, beyond insurance.At this stage, no one denies there is a problem, he said. There is a bit of a progress in terms of willingness to discuss what process might work, but not in terms of We will pay for the damage.ADAPTATION LIMITSThat is a key reason for this weeks hiccup in Marrakesh over the review of the WIM, which was due to be completed at these talks. Developing countries want the review to happen over the next year and cover the future of the mechanism, while developed countries fear that could trigger new demands over finance. Either way, it is clear the thorny problem wont just disappear, and needs more work.In a recent paper, Austrian researchers Reinhard Mechler and Thomas Schinko at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis said major scientific challenges remain, in particular to better understand the physical and social limits of adaptation  in other words, where loss and damage starts. Making more accurate projections of rising climate risks and the associated costs of measures to prevent and respond to loss and damage could help move the discussion forward, they added.In the meantime, Bangladesh is not waiting around. A 2010 World Bank study estimated the country would lose some $121 billion, or 5 percent of national GDP, between 2005 and 2050 due to climatic variability, including impacts such as a fall in rice production. Singh said the proposal to set up a national mechanism for loss and damage was a way of trying to speed solutions.It is saying we need to make progress faster at the international level, and we are ready to act at the national level, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

A drop in trading activities was also reported from Osmanabad, Beed, Jalna and other districts.""Everyone in the market was trying to push Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. On the other hand, there were no takers for those notes,"" Isa Khan, a wholesale dealer from the city-based Jadhavwadi market said.Adding to the woes, prices of all agriculture produce particularly vegetables fell significantly after the Centre scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Onions, potatoes and other vegetables prices have been witnessing a sharp dip in prices after the Centre scrapped the high-value currency notes. Green vegetable prices, including that of coriander, spinach, 'methi' among others, slipped by almost 50% over the last two days dampening farmers' expectations. Prices of cauliflower, cabbage, ladies finger, capsicum and green chilies also fell by around 40% to 50%.Ratan Wakde, a farmer from Danora village from the district's Gangapur taluka, sold ginger in the Jadhavwadi market on Thursday at a wholesale rate of Rs 1,400 a quintal, which is Rs 800 less than Sunday's price. ""On Sunday, ginger was priced at Rs 2,200 a quintal, but I do not understand the sudden drop,"" Wakde said.The APMC's yard in Parbhani wore a deserted look on Thursday, where many grain merchants suggested that farmers should not bring soyabean and other agriculture products for the next three to four days. ""I have a huge stock of the soyabean, but the current market conditions are not favourable to sell the crop. A few days ago, soyabean was sold at Rs 2,700 to Rs 2,800 a quintal. But, today some buyers were offering Rs 2,300 a quintal. I don't wish to sell the crop at such low rates and so I stayed away from the market,"" Sopan Garud, a farmer from Parbhani, said."

And in the absence of storage facilities, the farmers incurred huge losses. Furthermore, they did not get the promised incentive from the government.""We have no trust in the government. It has betrayed us twice,"" said B Barik, a farmer from the Balasore district.In a bid to encourage farmers to grow potatos, the state government had announced an incentive of Rs 20,000 per hectare. The Directorate of Horticulture has advised farmers interested in the government scheme to register their names in the offices of the local assistant agriculture officers or assistant horticulture officers.The Directorate has made arrangements for the supply of certified potato seeds to registered farmers, who will pay the cost up front. The subsidy amount will be transfered to their accounts.Meanwhile, the Directorate of Horticulture has invited nationalised banks in the state to credit subsidy for the DBT scheme under Rastriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), National Horticulture Mission (NHM) and other schemes of the government.The State Potato Mission launched at the end of 2014-15 had mandated the Directorate of Horticulture to create self-sufficiency in potato production, storage and distribution over the next three years.Since the state is procuring potato seeds from outside agencies, the mission has set a target to produce about 1.20 lakh tonnes of certified seed potatoes. The government has not become self-sufficient in seed production even in the second year of the mission.The Horticulture directorate has requested all the district collectors to hold mission committees and entrust all line departments for increasing potato area coverage in their districts."

Price of fish is also down by Rs 50-70 a kg. But it has not elicited a smile yet from customers struggling with cash. At Lansdowne market, Jadu Babur Bazar and Lake Market in south Kolkata, onion price has nosedived from Rs 25 a kg prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's demonetization announcement on Tuesday to Rs 18 a kg on Saturday. A similar situation was witnessed at Maniktala market in the northern part of the city.""People are just not buying unless absolutely necessary. One generally says that Bengalis will never compromise on food but I suspect less fish and meat dishes are being made now. So the demand for onion has dropped. Though supply in wholesale market has dipped because of the liquidity crunch across the country, there is still a glut due to lack of demand,"" said Asit Das, a vegetable vendor at Lansdowne Market.With dues piling up and pressure to clear the stock mounting, vendors are reducing prices. Everyone associated with onion, right from the farm in Nasik to here, is desperate to kick-start sales. ""At any other time, a drop in supply would have led to price rise. But it's just the opposite,"" said Mahadeb Mondal of Lake Market. ""While commodity prices dip normally when there is a liquidity crunch, the trend has so far been missing in Kolkata. But this time we see that happening,"" said Shankar Gupta, a vegetable trader in Kolkata.Price of tomato that comes from farms near Bengaluru is also headed southward, having dropped by Rs 2 in two days and is now retailing at Rs 18 a kg. ""The suppliers are not accepting payment in the demonetized currency notes and have agreed to take the payment later. They have slashed the price so that we accept the stock in this adverse situation,"" said Das.Price of Jyoti variety of potato that commanded Rs 20 per kg till Thursday was selling for Rs 18 on Saturday.Lower consumption has also brought down fish prices at city markets by at least Rs 50 per kg across varieties."

These new cold storages are in different stages of construction in 13 identified districts, official sources said.There is hadly any response private promoters to set up cold storages in the tribal dominated backward districts despite huge subsidy offered by the government. While the subsidy for new cold storages in plain area is 55 percent of the project cost subject to a maximum limit of Rs 2.20 lakh, the subsidy amount is Rs 2.80 lakh for scheduled areas.The state government has announced to provide subsidy of 50 per cent on electricity tariff for six years for the existing cold storages and the ones to come up by March 31, 2018 for storing potatoes and seed potatoes. Each cold store would have the capacity of 5,000 tonne.Of the 113 cold storages with a combined capacity of over 3 lakh tonnes in the state, about 80 stores are defunct.

The transporters have refused to carry potatoes any more as the unpaid fuel bills are mounting.With fuel stations refusing any more credit to transporters, there is a chain reaction hitting transportation of potatoes.The retail price of the tuber declined on Saturday following the severe liquidity crunch. But it happened as the retailers sacrificed their margin of profit to facilitate faster offtake of the stockpile. ""But this dip at retail level will be temporary as both the wholesale and retail prices will rise, thanks to shortage of supply,"" Swapan Samanta, secretary West Bengal Potato Traders Association , told TOI.Price of potato (Jyoti variety) at the retail end dipped to Rs 18 from Rs 20-Rs 22 in some markets on Saturday. This was offered by retailers to encourage customers to buy more. However, the crisis will be felt in the retail markets soon because of the shortage in supply . The wholesale price of Jyoti and Chandramukhi was Rs 12 and Rs 22 respectively in Hooghly, the largest producer of potato in Bengal.According to Patit Paban De, member, West Bengal Cold Storage Association , 462 potato cold storages across Bengal still has stockpile of 13 lakh tonnes. Out of this, only 3 lakh tonnes will be used as seeds. The rest should have been out in the market. But sudden liquidity crunch has disrupted the system. Small farmers are not taking out potatoes they had hoarded in cold storages. Traders, particularly, transporters are feeling the heat.In Hooghly district alone, there are 161 potato cold storages which still have a sizeable stockpile. November 30 is the deadline for complete stock clearance. The new crop will be coming shortly. Potato prices have shot up since May as the production had dropped in Bengal, the second largest producer of the tuber.Traders and companies, however, expect the downward trend in the agriculture market to continue in the short term as the harvest season is on and the country is looking at a record khariff crop. ""The smallest player in the entire system, the farmer, is panicking. We expect prices to go down further in the short term,"" said agriculture economist Sarit Basu."

We accepted initial couple of days inconvenience as our contribution to fight against corruption. But now the situation is fast changing, people need swift access to their own money for their daily needs, said Sangram Keshari Rout, a resident of Sahidnagar of the city.The scene across the city looked similar to situation witnessed after any disaster. People would keep waiting nearby ATMs for our hours. Once they would spot a vehicle coming for cash replenishment, they would lose no time to form queues before ATM counters. Almost all localities of the capital city witnessed similar sights.Small traders were worst hit as the demonetisation announcement made their business to nose-dive. I usually sell potato and onion worth Rs. 10,000 everyday and it goes up to Rs. 15,000 on Sundays. However, I have not touched Rs. 3,000 today, said Pratap Swain, a trader in Unit-I market, of the city.Many grocery shops in colony areas have remained closed for past three days. If I will open my shop, my customers will request me to sell commodities on credit. I might face difficulties in recovering the money. It is better to keep the shop closed for a few more days, said Manua Das in Baranga market.Identical situation prevailed in almost all districts of the State.

Payments at APMCs are currently at only 10 per cent levels since traders dont have enough currency notes.The currency crunch resulted by the Centres demonetisation move is set to hit farmers, agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) and farm produce transporters ahead of a bright Rabi season, forcing the government to plan measures to tackle the impending crisis.An urgent meeting was held at Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swawalamban Mission, a government organisation, at Amravati Monday to discuss the problem. We are expecting both bumper crop of soyabean and cotton in the Kharif season in Vidarbha and a very bright Rabi prospect across the state due to the last heavy spell of rains and visible positive impact of Jalayukta Shivar scheme. But with currency crunch, both procurement at APMCs and the ability of farmers to purchase seeds have been badly affected. Payments at APMCs are currently at only 10 per cent levels since traders dont have enough currency notes. The farmers are also facing problem in buying seeds for the forthcoming Rabi season which is likely to go up manifold in Vidarbha and Marathwada. We have thought of some measures to address these issues, Kishor Tiwari, director of the mission, told The Indian Express.Watch What Else Is making NewsHe said they had requested the state government to approach the Centre with request to allow use of old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 for purchase of seeds at government and registered private centres. We also want the banks to make enough new currency notes available to APMCs to tide over the payment problem. If the farmers dont get money against procurement, how will they pay for purchasing seeds and other inputs for rabi, Tiwari said.He added, With sparse bank and ATM availability in rural parts, the problem is all the more serious for farmers and needs urgent intervention.Another problem is the possibility of the transportation of perishable farm produce coming to a halt in a few days time due to currency crunch. The transporters need money for their daily expenses. In the event of the currency crunch, we are afraid that they might be able to ply on a much lower scale after about a week from now. This might need to supply crunch and increase in prices of vegetables, said a senior state government official who did not wish to be named.

258,Cash crunch strains food chain,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161115/jsp/frontpage/story_119272.jsp,2016-11-15,Telegraph,"Uday Hazra is an affluent farmer. His fields are flush with harvest-ready paddy but he cannot hire day labourers. Shiva Sambhu Das is a day labourer who works on farms to earn Rs 100 and 2kg rice a day. He needs money to feed his family and pay for his children's education. Sarashi Jasan Samanta's shop is brimming with fertilisers he had stocked ahead of the potato-sowing season. But he is not getting customers. Samir Sahana runs a poultry unit, but the demand for his chickens has dipped. Nov. 14: The fates of Hazra, Samanta, Sahana and Das are bound together by cash, the absence of which is disrupting the rural food chain. Unless cash flows from Hazra to Das, the labourer cannot harvest the farmer's ripe crop. If the crop is not harvested, the farmer will not be able to buy and sow potato seeds, which means Samanta's fertilisers will not find a taker. Unless the farmer, farmhand and the fertiliser supplier complete the economic jigsaw, Sahana's meat will remain unsold. Cash, indeed, is the binding force that holds life together in rural Bengal - and in most of India's hinterland. Hazra, Das, Samanta and Sahana are residents of Burdwan's Kendur village, around 140km from Calcutta. The plight of the four residents is a textbook case of the impact of the demonetisation - and the resultant currency crunch - announced by the Prime Minister on November 8. ""I cannot get my paddy fields harvested because I have to pay around Rs 1,000 daily to six or seven labourers. I have to harvest my crop soon as the paddy is ready and time is running out to sow potato seeds. But I don't have the money to buy the seeds or the fertiliser,"" said Hazra, who can be categorised as a big farmer in Bengal. The 62-year-old has a two-storey house that bears all the signs of solvency, from a double-door fridge to a water filter. His cowshed houses 10 cows, and prime gobindobhog paddy fills the silo in his courtyard. The farmer has one new Rs 2,000 note and several Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Hazra spoke of a stifling feeling of cashlessness. Told that his home and surroundings did not suggest such a sorry state of affairs, he said that for rural households, savings meant what was grown in the fields. ""I have 110 packs of quality paddy at home, which I retained after the last harvest so that I could sell them this winter at a better price. But there are no buyers. Even if I find some, they will insist that I accept the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes,"" Hazra said. At Badamtala in Burdwan town, where the big rice traders have their gaddis (offices), several traders said the price of paddy had started falling after the demonetisation announcement. The price of gobindobhog has dipped from around Rs 2,200 a pack of 60kg to Rs 2,000. Other crops too are fetching lower prices, the traders said. Although the big farmers are often accused of exploiting the labourers, they remain the drivers of the rural economy, where the organised public and private sectors hardly generate any employment. By engaging in agriculture, they provide a livelihood to others in the village ecosystem. In neighbouring Hooghly district, another fertile zone where farmers grow three to four crops, labourer Rabin Sing is losing around Rs 500 every day this harvesting season. ""I work in two shifts during harvesting as I have to feed a family of four.... The farmer I work for gave me Rs 500 saying it can be changed in the bank. I lost a day trying to do that but couldn't exchange it. The farmers don't have money,"" said Sing, who is praying for a speedy return to normality. After demonetisation, he has been left with his life's savings of Rs 3,000 - two Rs 1,000 notes and two Rs 500 notes. After the experience at the bank, he deposited the money with two kirana stores from where he will buy his monthly provisions. ""They said they would give me provisions against this money.... But I don't have any cash. I can't buy medicine, fish or egg,"" Sing said, sitting near a kirana shop in Mirzapur, 50km from Calcutta, where 95 per cent people depend on agriculture. The shop had become the venue for an evening adda . Soon, stories of inconvenience were being exchanged. But some in the audience protested, emphasising that a few days' pain was worth the bigger gain in the future. When this correspondent asked about black money and why it was bad for the economy, Sanjay Patra, a carpenter, said: ""I don't know all that... but rich people will now face the music."" What about the misery of his fellow villagers? It's just a matter of a few days, he said. But P. Sainath, the founding editor of People's Archive of Rural India and a veteran journalist who has written extensively on poverty, said: ""The Prime Minister is talking about bearing pain for 50 days.... You can imagine how long it will take. But there is little doubt that the impact on the rural economy is going to be devastating."" Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India, predicted that the demonetisation's effect on the rural economy and country's informal sector could reduce GDP growth by one percentage point this year. ""Whatever you are witnessing in rural Bengal is not unique; it's happening across India as the sowing season is going to start and people have no money to buy seeds, fertilisers or pesticides,"" Sen said. Textbook economics says that the surplus generated in agriculture sustains the other sectors by generating multiplier effects, which help the economy grow. As the rural economy is cash-based, the first casualty is spending power. ""I was in Chikalthana, on the edge of Aurangabad (Maharashtra). Nobody has cash there. There is chaos and a law-and-order situation is developing,"" Sainath said. Some analysts have been saying that rural India's ""resilience"", arising from an informal credit system that facilitates cashless transactions among acquaintances, will help it cope. Hazra, Das, Samanta and Sahana agreed that left without cash, they had been able to survive the past six days because of the credit system. Mirzapur residents echoed the assessment. ""At the village level, a personalised credit system works. But it cannot sustain as the moment you are out of the village, it doesn't work,"" said Sainath. Sen said that although the rural population can tide itself over the crisis for some time, its indebtedness would grow and make the villagers more vulnerable to moneylenders. ""The indebtedness in the economy is growing, and it's not a good sign,"" he added."

A lot of vegetables have started rotting, wholesale trader Farooq Riaz said.While the vegetable mandi is functional, onion and potato traders have decided to suspend their operation till Thursday.The problem is that we are not able to pay farmers and commission agents as there is shortage of smaller denomination notes. Farmers dont accept cheque and so operations have been suspended for a few days, Sunil Rajani, a wholesale trader said.At present, onion and potato are trading at Rs 8 per kg but prices might increase in the coming days.Around 100-125 truck carrying about 30,000-35,000 bags of onions come to Choithram mandi daily. Their local consumption is about 20% while the rest is sent to nearby areas. Some traders are giving vegetable to vendors on credit, but such operations are limited. Commission agents said while farmers were bringing their produce to the market there was no cash to pay them.To tackle corruption, tax evasion and uncover undeclared wealth the Prime Minister on Tuesday demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes."

But they were caught unawares by the unprecedented surge in orders ""We were just not ready,"" said Hari Menon, co-founder and CEO of Big Basket. ""We forecast demand two months in advance and plan accordingly. But panic has set in among consumers. They want to stock up on daily essentials. It's like the queue you find at a petrol pump before a price hike.""Big Basket and Grofers, the largest e-grocers in the country, saw the number of online orders for staples soar over the weekend. While orders to Grofer's doubled overnight, Big Basket, which operates in 25 cities, witnessed a jump of 35%. Menon said card payments have overtaken cash-on-delivery on its portal. ""Earlier, it was 50:50. Now, digital payments account for 80% of our orders,"" he said.The increase in volume of orders was mainly due to new consumers coming online for the first time to shop for veggies. ""Demand for veggies has increased by three times, while for fruits, it has fallen. The average ticket size of Rs 300 is more or less the same, even now,"" said Albinder Dhindsa, co-founder at Grofers. ""Due to less cash available, small merchants are not able to replenish supplies. Finding change for Rs 2,000 note is also an issue, therefore the online rush.""Sales at hyperlocal e-grocers that sell everything from potatoes and litchis to toothpastes and moisturisers, are linked to stocks available at kirana stores and neighbourhood vegetable vendors. Many of them sell online through these websites. Therefore at present, the main hurdle for e-grocers is to bolster their supply chain so that they are able meet the spike in demand.Menon said Big Basket has started hiring more people and buying delivery vans. ""It will take us at least two weeks to get ready for the rush, since new people have to be trained and the vans have to be rigged with chillers and other paraphernalia,"" he said.Grofers, which mainly depends on small merchants who are selling on its websites, has extended a credit line of up to Rs 2 lakh to them. ""The main goal is to help merchants come back online,"" said Dhindsa. ""We have partnered with many brands as well to provide goods on credit to these small businesses."""
262,"October inflation down, call for rate cut",http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161116/jsp/business/story_119404.jsp,2016-11-16,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Nov. 15: Softening food prices have helped to ease retail as well as wholesale inflation in October, raising hopes that the RBI may go in for another rate cut in its monetary policy review next month. Consumer price index-based inflation eased to a 14-month low of 4.20 per cent in October, while WPI inflation fell to a four-month low of 3.39 per cent. Retail inflation was 4.39 per cent in September, whereas the wholesale price index-based inflation stood at 3.57 per cent. Retail food inflation fell to 3.32 per cent in October from 3.96 per cent in September. For the second month in a row, retail inflation is less than the target of 5 per cent set by the RBI. The WPI food inflation basket, too, showed moderation with inflation at 4.34 per cent in October against 5.75 per cent in the previous month. However, pulses and potatoes showed an elevated trend even though it moderated from September. Pulses inflation declined to 21.80 per cent in October from 23.99 per cent in the previous month, while in the case of potatoes the figure was 60.58 per cent against 73.31 per cent. WPI inflation in fuel was up at 6.18 per cent in October against 5.58 per cent in September because of a price rise in both petrol and diesel. Manufactured products, which comprise about 65 per cent of the index, saw inflation ticking up to 2.67 per cent in October from 2.48 per cent in the previous month. The Monetary Policy Committee headed by RBI governor Urjit Patel had last month cut benchmark interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 6.25 per cent. While Patel had signalled more tolerance towards inflation, easing in CPI data was in line with the RBI's forecast. This, many expect, will create more room for rate cuts. Industry chamber CII said, going forward, both the wholesale and retail price inflation were likely to remain muted as favourable monsoon would augment food supplies in the marketplace and international commodity prices would remain under pressure."

This is the slowest rate at which retail inflation has grown in 14 months, having grown at 4.39 per cent in September helped by small rises in food prices.Making calls for a rate cut shriller, wholesale inflation also slowed down significantly in October, only growing by 3.39 per cent.The easing in CPI data is in line with the RBIs forecast for an average of 5 percent inflation for this financial year.The CPI saw the biggest slowdown in the vegetables category, which continued in the negative zone at (-)5.74 per cent as against (-)7.21 percent in the previous month of September. Sugar and confectionery, however, became dearer by 23.62 per cent.Pulses inflation numbers come as a respite to consumers who have battled high costs, slowing down to 4.11 per cent against 14.33 per cent. However, eggs became more expensive by 9.4 per cent.The index for fuel and light segment stood at 2.81 per cent in October as against 3.07 per cent a month ago.Wholesale price inflation, meanwhile, slowed for the second consecutive month at 3.39 per cent, again pushed by a decline in vegetable prices, which till July had scaled a high of 28.45 per cent.Easing inflation has prompetd industry representatives to demand a further reduction in interest rates to support investor as well as consumer sentiment.An immediate 50 basis points cut in repo rate should be considered by RBI as well as some measures, which may be introduced to provide easy finance for sectors like housing, automobiles and consumer durables, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry President Harshavardhan Neotia said.As per data on the wholesale price index released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry, prices of pulses and potato ruled high this year.

Prices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.Shortage of new currency notes has hit potato farmers in Punjab, who are now struggling to sell their stock of potato seeds. At the peak of the potato sowing season, the lack of new notes in the market is preventing potential buyers from purchasing supplies.There are buyers but they do not have the new currency. We have been sending our trucks to other states, but there are no labourers to unload the stock. There is no money to pay them, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. Most of the traders are small businessmen and they prefer purchasing the stock with cash, he added. The potato farmers of Punjab are also the primary suppliers of potato seeds across the country.The rates of potato seeds too have crashed over the past one week, from Rs 1,800 per 50 kg to Rs 1,000- 1,200 for the same amount.Watch What Else is Making NewsPrices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.After 1984 riots, which also happened in November, this is the first time we are facing such a crisis. Trucks are ready with the supplies, but transporters do not have cash to send them to other states, said Sangha.Punjab has around 560 cold storage units which dispatch about 1.1 million tonnes (mt) of potato seeds to other states, while 0.4 mt is used by potato growers within Punjab. So far not even 40 per cent of the seed stock has been sold, said farmers.The potato planting season begins in early October and lasts till November 25 across the country. In Punjab, the seeds are sown in October itself, and the first batch of the vegetable arrives in the market by mid-November. In the other states, the potato seeds are only sown in November.Punjab, which produces about 2.2 mt of potatoes a year, supplies the seeds of the vegetable to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat etc. Punjab meets around 63 per cent of the annual potato seed demand of the country.Apart from the small amount of seeds used in Punjab in October, most of the stock has been lying in cold storage units.Said Raghbir Singh, president of the JPGA, Several traders who had come to Punjab last week to buy the potato seeds returned empty-handed. The farmers here were not willing to accept the scrapped currency notes.We do not know how to tide over this situation. The government should have had adequate stock of new currency notes. The seed supply season lasts only for three weeks. We are bound to incur heavy losses, said Satnam Singh, a potato grower.Doaba region, where potato seeds are grown on around 90,000 hectares, is considered the potato seed bowl of the country.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
265,When cash vanishes: A double-whammy,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-currency-ban-pune-farmers-wholesale-market-4379579/,2016-11-17,Indian Express,"The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre) The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre)The last one week and more has brought nothing but bad news for Vasant Pimpale. This farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale, a village in Pune districts Junnar taluka, has already lost 11 tonnes of green chilli grown on eight out of his 15-acres holding. The loss hasnt been courtesy drought, flood or hail, but because of a disaster totally man-made.Till early this month, I used to dispatch roughly two tonnes of vegetables (including cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal) every day to the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. But after November 8, I am unable to send even 800 kg, as the traders have told me that there is no demand, says Pimpale, who has had to endure the loss of his chilli crop, which has turned from green to red, simply for lack of buyers. And hes clear what has been behind his tale of misfortune: the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSince November 8, the day demonetisation happened, prices of green chilli at Vashi have fallen from around Rs 14 to Rs 3 per kg, while similarly dropping from Rs 13 to Rs 4 for cauliflower and from Rs 26 to Rs 12 for brinjal. The market for our produce has all but collapsed, complains Pimpale, who is among the many farmers in rural Maharashtra to have been impacted by the virtual disappearance of cash from the system.The bulk of them have operational bank accounts, but sell their entire produce for cash to traders who are now strapped for currency. With the mandis in Nashik, Lasalgaon, Manchar, Manmad and other produce market towns officially closed and even the terminal market at Vashi registering steep drop in trading volumes, farmers  particularly those growing perishables like vegetables and flowers that cannot remain in or outside fields too long after maturity  are the hardest hit.Shriram Gadve, a farmer from Arvi near Narayangaon and also president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, estimates that Junnar  the taluka where his village, too, falls  alone has some 40,000 acres under vegetable cultivation. 95 per cent of growers in this belt sell to the Vashi terminal market that is about 160 km away, while the rest dispose of their produce in nearby mandis such as Narayangaon and Manchar. The ones selling at Vashi do it through hundekaris.The hundekaris are essentially local farmers, acting as conduits between growers, organised into groups, and traders sitting at Vashi. They aggregate the growers produce and arrange for its transport against a one per cent commission on the final price. While the traders in Vashi issue pattis (purchase slips) in the name of individual farmers, the entire payment after deducting transport cost and labour charges is made to the hundekaris. The hundekari may receive the payment either in cash or even through bank account transfer. But he pays the farmers belonging to his group entirely in cash.The pattis are sent to farmers a day after sale takes place, while payments happen on a weekly basis. We pay in cash after withdrawing the money from our own account. The farmers selling directly in local markets, too, transact wholly in cash, explains Sachin Gadve, a five-acre farmer from Arvi who is also a hundekari for 60 growers. Since demonetisation, the traders in Vashi have told us to send less quantities, as they are finding to it difficult to offload the produce further to retailers selling to the final consumer, he adds.Its very simple. The household end-buyer has no cash to purchase from the feriwala (hawker/retailer), who, in turn, sources from us. Everybody down the chain to the farmer has naturally been affected, points out Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion Potato Commission Agents and Traders Union at the Vashi market, which, on an average day, receives 700-800 truckloads of vegetables and 100-115 of onions and potatoes. On Wednesday, these numbers were down to 300 and 40 trucks, respectively. Our whole business is done in cash. Today, we are neither able to sell the produce nor in a position to pay farmers, he notes.The situation is no different in other markets. Daily vegetable arrivals at Punes agriculture produce market committee mandi, which used to be around 200 truckloads, has dropped to 80. In most suburban markets, there has been no trading at all for the last one week. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, has written a letter to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, seeking permission for transactions in mandis using the now-withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 90 per cent of the business was, in any case, being done in these so-called high-value notes. If they have permitted petrol pumps to accept these, why cannot the same be allowed for agricultural produce in regulated markets such as ours? he asks.What makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. Hardly a week before demonetisation, Abhay Gadve, a five-acre farmer also from Arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to Vashi and realised a net value of Rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. In my latest patti, all that I got was Rs10,000 for the same quantity. The traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. If I sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. Theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the Junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. All this will be lost because of demonetisation. And we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers Gadve.But its not just collapse of demand and prices. The cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. We normally start operations from the first week of November, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. Since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. At the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Pimpale, the farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale village who also manages a farm input shop at Narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of Rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. Currently, I am hardly doing Rs 25,000-30,000. Farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and I am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. If cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
266,Cash crunch & confusion trigger trade shutdown ,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Cash-crunch-confusion-trigger-trade-shutdown/article16511611.ece,2016-11-17,The Hindu,"more-inTraders across the country have been forced to virtually shut down their businesses following the governments surprise move to demonetise high-value currency notes and transition from a cash-based to a less cash economy. Besides, traders said, there was a lot of confusion and misinformation due to the government changing the norms every other day.Traders pleaTo improve the situation, the traders have suggested they be allowed to accept old currency notes (of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations) with proper KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, with a commitment to deposit the notes in banks on the very same day. Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion given by the apex traders body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency. Mr. Seth, who is also the joint secretary, Automotive Parts Merchants Association, added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses. For those dealing in high value items, doing business has become virtually impossible. He pointed out that with all the workers waiting in queues before banks to withdraw money or to deposit old notes, many man-hours are being wasted, which, in turn, was a loss to the national economy.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to lack of sufficient currency notes. Many traders are finding it difficult to pay the farmers for their produce. The main market areas in Bengaluru city were also impacted. APMC yard in Bengaluru is known for its cash payments. Only because of the on-time payment did many farmers prefer Bengaluru. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50, 000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs to farmers on a daily basis, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association. He added, This is the season when Karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. We need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers. In the current scenario we are not able to help the farmers and reward them for their work.Business has dropped over 70 per cent as most of the trade is depended on the cash economy. As per the estimates of the Karnataka Hosiery & Garment Association (KHGA), the sector has seen the lowest business in the last couple of years. The association also said the current account weekly withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 will not help the traders as many small traders need more than Rs.50000 for daily business needs. The government should soon bring Rs. 500 notes to the market to achieve normalcy, said Sajjan Raj Mehta, former president, KHGA.In Kolkata, Anupam Boral, Proprietor of a small firm, Geetanjali Solar Enterprises (GSE), said the shortage of Rs 100 notes is also hurting business. For instance, Boral said he is finding it difficult to get five notes in Rs 100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the Central Glass Research and Ceramic Institute. Though there is an option of pay order, small businesses like ours are having difficulties in finding people to stand in a long queue on our behalf to get a bank order."" On other practical difficulties that he facing on a daily basis, Boral said, I am also unable to pay my transporters as their bill varies between Rs 800 to Rs 1500. The shortage of Rs 100 rupee is crippling us. Even if I avail the cash credit facility  it comes in five notes of Rs 2000 denomination.""In Coimbatore, there is a lot of confusion and misinformation on cash and withdrawal limits. P.K. Govindaraj, who has a foundry at the SIDCO Industrial Estate at Kurichi in Coimbatore, went to the bank on Thursday morning to draw Rs. 30,000 from his Cash Credit (CC) account, but was in for a shock when he was told that the maximum limit is only Rs. 10,000. He said, I employ 50 people and need Rs. 80,000 a week for their wages and another Rs. 20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc. How can I manage a week with Rs. 10,000?The castings manufactured at the foundry are sold at his shop in Coimbatore city. We usually use the cash from the sales at the shop. But, there are so many restrictions now and I had to draw money from the bank. I have this account for nearly 40 years. We should be allowed to withdraw more, he says. However, another foundry owner in the city was able to draw Rs. 50,000 from his CC account. He had drawn Rs. 10,000 last Friday and was allowed to draw another Rs. 40,000 on Thursday. There is no clarity on the issue. Some banks allowed the industries that have CC account to draw Rs. 50,000 a week and some have not, said V. Sundaram, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association.The plight of small scale industrial units in Hyderabad is no different from those in several parts of the country as a result of demonetization. Cash is the predominant mode of transaction for them. Since bank finance to them is limited, the entrepreneurs depend on hand loans and the informal sector  avenues that have hit a roadblock over the last week.Federation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry leaders Ravindra Modi and V. Anil Reddy counted payment of wages, transportation charges and replacement of machinery spare parts among aspects that get affected immediately. Since customers are not insulated from the cash crunch, there is bound to be pressure on revenue generation cycle.Though there is bound to be impact in the short term, the units need to take into account benefit the demonetization exercise would deliver in the long run, says K.Koteswara Rao, Convenor of All India Forum for Small and Medium Industries. He expected the lending rates to come down and money coming into the system to be used for infrastructure development in the country.(Inputs from Pradeesh Chandran, Indrani Dutta, M.

If the cash crunch led to a drastic fall in price of fish and vegetables in the last few days, perishable items disappeared all of a sudden on Wednesday. A few of the traders who had dared to hoard them sold the items at a premium.""Initially, there was a distress sale by retailers as there was no flow of cash. The system virtually ran on credit. Now, there is a supply shortage and the flow of cash led to the rise of wholesale and retail prices. The trend will continue for next few days till the liquidity crunch is over and supply line is stabilized,"" said Prasanta Khan, a wholesale supplier.The problem in supply line, however, persists. Payment to transporters is still an issue. Moreover, the credit line from the wholesalers to retailers continues to swell. This has adversely affected the market dynamics. Fish wholesalers, on the other hand, could not pay back bulk suppliers. ""The currency crunch has disrupted the entire supply chain,"" said Ankur Modal of Behala fish wholesale market. ""The retailers are not confident of off-taking pricey varieties lest they are not,"" said Amar Das, Fish Merchant Association secretary at Lake Market.The vegetable supply remains steady in most of the markets, yet prices rose significantly. Potato price at Ratanpur wholesale market rose from Rs 600 on Tuesday to Rs 650 on Wednesday per 50-kg bag of Jyoti variety.

The retailers also do not have enough cash to pay for what they buy from the wholesalers. The cycle is moving on the strength of credit only. Most of us are giving 3-4 days credit, said Amarvir Singh, president of Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Sellers Association, Ludhiana.WATCH VIDEORasheed, an ahrtiya who works in Malerkotlas vegetable mandi that sends vegetables to mandis in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Moga and a large part of Punjab apart from Jammu, said, Cauliflower is available with me at Rs 3 a kg while potato coming from cold stores is available in the range of Rs 4-5 a kg. You can take a sack full of gobhi at the rate of Rs 2 or Rs 3 a kg from me and I am ready to give 50 kg aaloo in the range of Rs 200-250 a kg. Most ahrtiyas are selling at this rate only. Last week, wholesale cauliflower was priced at Rs 8-10 per kg. Carrot, which was available at 20 a kg, is now priced at Rs 10 in wholesale market and methi and palak are available at Rs 5-6 a kg against the previous rate of Rs 9-10 a kg in most mandis of Punjab.Amarvir said, A box of apple is available at Rs 500 against the previous price of Rs 600. Almost everything is cheap. Retailers are buying it cheap from us. What prices they are selling, we have no idea.The worst hit are farmers who have to sell the produce at dirt cheap prices as there is no point stocking perishable vegetables. We are sending our full stock to mandis as we have no choice. We cant hoard, said Amarjeet Singh, a vegetable grower from Bhurrekalan village of Ferozepur. A few farmers near Hussaniwala are giving a carrot bag of 50 kg for Rs 200 only as they have lost hope of getting good prices and hence are planning to sow another crop in their fields.WATCH VIDEOI was happy with the move of demonetisation but it has affected my own crop, he said.However, in retail market, cauliflower is available for Rs 20-30 a kg, carrot for Rs 25-30 a kg. Potatos are available at Rs 25-30 a kg.It is difficult to go to the wholesale market to buy vegetables. So we have no choice but to purchase from the vendor at his prices. Moreover, we are buying just half a kg instead of usual one kg because of cash crunch, said Kiranjeet Kaur, a housewife from New Model town.Manjeet Kaur, another homemaker, said, I am buying vegetables on credit from my vendor and I pay him after 2-3 days.

It seems like the will to shop has completely vanished. There are no customers in the market. People are coming with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which we are not accepting as it has been scrapped. Very few people have smaller denomination notes or the new Rs 2,000 notes. We are not accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 as we have to deposit those with the banks, and going by the crowd at the banks and ATMs with people lining up for hours its not feasible for us to accept bigger notes. As one travels from market to market, its almost like a chorus  no customers, no money, worries galore. Maharajganj market in Patna City generally sees daily sales of around Rs 2 crore; it is now scraping up just about Rs 25-30 lakh. People are not coming, said Akhilesh, a trader. There is a drop in customers as well as overallsales. The market is usually overcrowded, but nowadays it is silent. Most people now want to meet their basic needs first, and they are saving lower denomination currency notes for emergency situations. Patnas biggest wholesale fruits market, Bazaar Samiti, which generally witnesses huge crowds in the morning, wore a deserted look on Wednesday. The market, which used to have daily sales of more than Rs 10 lakh, has virtually collapsed. Sales at present stand at Rs 1-2 lakh only, said Haji Mohammad Min Alam, president, Patna Food Merchant Association. We accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in the initial two-three days on humanitarian grounds as people come to us from far-flung areas such as Ara, Danapur, Naubatpur, Fatuha. However, we have now stopped accepting the bigger notes and the people are short of lower denomination notes. This has hit the market significantly as people in general are saving the smaller notes for their basic necessities. He added: At times, the situation spirals out of control and there is fear of violence as people insist on paying with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as they want to get rid of those. Its not just demand; supply to the markets has been hit as well. Before demonetisation, if 20 trucks used to come daily from other states like Kashmir and Maharashtra, the number now has gone down to five or six, saidRazi Ahmed, another trader. The reason is that we are not beingable to send money to those states. The sellers problem has been further compounded here as they are unable to recover money from retailers, which in turn has made sending money to other states adifficult task. To ensure the fruits dontrot, traders are sending them tocold stores. We dont have hope that the market transactions will revive this month,"" Ahmed added. Another problem we are facing is that the transporters and porters working in the market have also refused to accept the invalid currencies as payments. As a result, several trucks from other states are still stationed here. Another wholesale fruit dealer Wasim said: As fruit markets are cash-oriented markets, scrapping of the bigger notes has brought market activity to a grinding halt. The footfall has fallen by 90 per cent with sales dropping to one-tenth of the usual figures. Unlike malls, transactions here take place in cash. When there is not much cash available, how will people shop? Vegetable markets are the only silver lining. Dinesh, a wholesaler at Anta Ghat, Patnas biggest wholesale market for vegetables, said: During the first two-days, the market witnessed very low turnout of customers as sudden action of the government banning notes left the customers with no choice. Sales had dropped by 50 per cent. The market on a normal day has a daily turnover of around Rs 10-15 lakh. However, as people cannot live without vegetables, they have no choice but to buy them. This necessity brought the customers back to the market. People are paying in smaller notes for buying vegetables. At times, we are also accepting bigger notes if people are buying large quantities just to save the customers from more agony. Prices of vegetables have remained stable. Prices of potato and tomato remain the same as before the demonetisation with potatoes being sold at Rs 20 per kg while tomato ranges between Rs 20-25 per kg, said Another seller, Rajesh Singh, a trader. Onion, which we were earlier selling at Rs 15 per kg, has shot up to Rs 20, but that is due to delay in consignment from Nashik and not due to demonetisation."

Fuel pumps have been remaining closed for the past one week as stocks ran dry. Prices of other daily essentials rose with the stock depleting fast.Citizen organisations yesterday seized potato bags from the city's grocery shops and sold them at Rs 20 per kg.Angered by the scarcity of essential commodities, people have stopped their supply to the Naga-dominated districts from Imphal in the past few days.Citizens' organisations in Churachandpur district today checked the stock and price of such goods in the shops at Churachandpur town.The situation eased to some extent today after the state government yesterday brought nearly 200 loaded trucks and tankers, which were stranded at various points in Assam, with security escorts along the Imphal-Jiribam highway.Some of the petrol pumps in Imphal were opened today.Police and India Reserve Battalion escorts brought 75 loaded trucks to Imphal from Chandel district.The JAC of Sadar Hills was infuriated at chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh's alleged failure to fulfil his promise of creating the district on November 1, the day the annual Kut festival of the Kuki community is celebrated.The JAC had even constructed a foundation stone to mark the district's inauguration. Angered by Ibobi Singh's ""betrayal"", the JAC asked Congress members of the autonomous district council in Sadar Hills to resign from the party immediately. It also asked all district and block-level Congress workers from Sadar Hills to resign by tomorrow.Officials of the Union home ministry held talks with a UNC delegation in New Delhi on Tuesday on the blockade. The meeting could not arrive at a consensus as no representative of the Manipur government was present.Ibobi Singh had clarified that no representative was sent as the home ministry did not send any invitation.Official sources said the state government is planning to restore the supply mostly on the Imphal-Jiribam highway by providing enough security escorts."

While there were certain variations across city markets, the overall price curve continued to slide downwards 10 days after the demonetisation move.Markets across the city witnessed low sales even on Thursday. ""I have barely sold 15kg potato since morning. Normally we sell around 120kg each day. The slump has pushed us into a severe cash crunch,"" said Gopal Kundu, a vegetable vendor at Lake Market Potato prices have witnessed the sharpest dip in the past three days after wholesale prices came down to Rs 11 per kg for the Jyoti variety on Wednesday. ""Based on the grading of the Jyoti variety, prices varied between Rs 11 and Rs 12 at the wholesale markets,"" said Patit Paban Dey, former president of West Bengal Cold Storage Association. ""It seems that farmers needed cash to stay afloat and decided to release potato at a lower price,"" he added.""We are yet to receive the Nasik variety of onion. But the prices have come down further. This normally happens when the market is flush with new produce,"" said Shakti Prasad Ghara, a vegetable vendor at the New Market. Prices of seasonal vegetables are also showing a downward trend with supplies increasing at the city markets. ""New produce have started coming in and prices of seasonal vegetables like beans, cabbage, capsicum and carrot have come down substantially,"" said Rajat Laskar, a vegetable vendor at Gariahat Market.Egg prices have witnessed a sharp drop in the past few days, and the fish market is suffering because vendors aren't accepting the Rs 2,000 notes.On the other hand, transporters are worried about the liquidity crunch after the toll tax is re-imposed from November 24."

However, APMC trading did not have much impact on prices of commodities. In the Modasa APMC, around 2,500 quintal of groundnut and cotton were traded and the market opened on a high note . There were fears of reduction in price, but in fact the quality of crops raised prices. Groundnut and cotton fetched prices on par with the minimum support price announced by the government.""At Prantij, which is the biggest market for trading of paddy, price was around Rs 300 for 20 kg; the MSP is Rs 294,"" said C G Patel the secretary of Prantij APMC. Farmers were accepting cheques for 90% of payment. According to market sources, if the entire trading were to be conducted with cash, a marketyard would need at least 2 crore per day, which was not possible because of the recent cash crisis.Mahesh Patel, the secretary of Gondal APMC, said that farmers were not willing to sell their produce if payments were made with cheques; farmers said cheques would take three days to clear. Moreover, they said, they would have to queue up for hours outside banks to withdraw just Rs 24,000 a week. ""This amount is not adequate to meet transport expenses and wages of labourers,"" Patel said. Bhikhabhai Gajeram, the secretary of Junagadh APMC, said: ""Traders in APMC are finding it difficult to purchase."" He said oil millers, whose entire business was conducted with cash, were not willing to pay through cheques. ""Hence when there is no buying, APMC traders are not purchasing from farmers,"" Gajeram said. A B Pandya, the secretary of Amreli APMC, said farmers feared that some cheques may be dishonoured. They were also concerned that traders could cheat them. However, in Ahmedabad, some traders were doing business with cheques . Kishore, an Ahmedabad trader, said: ""We are purchasing onions and potatoes coming to the APMC with cheques and sellers are accepting cheques readily."" At the APMC Jetalpur, against the average of 500 trucks, only 140 arrived for trading. Prices remained constant and there was not much of an impact."

Only 5,000 crates of pomegranates were supplied by farmers, instead of the regular average of 15,000 crates. In Neera market, the auction of jaggery dropped by almost 50%, with the unloading of about 1,000 boxes as against the daily standard of 2,000 boxes. Meanwhile in Junnar , trade in fresh vegetables, onion, tomatoes and potatoes was down by 40%.Traders and farmers at these local markets have traditionally preferred transactions in cash, and were caught off-guard by the sudden announcement. The cancellation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has affected the payments, while purchases have also suffered. Even prices have dropped because of the low demand for farm produce.Officials in the agriculture produce market committee fear that more time would be required before things return to normal.An official attached to the market committee in Indapur said, ""Pomegranates have a huge market here, and a daylong auction registers transactions amounting to over Rs 50 lakh. This is peak season for pomegranate sales. We were expecting a rise in trade. However, for the last week, it has dropped drastically. Cash crunch forced traders and farmers to suspend auction because of the ban on cash transactions using demonetised notes. The auction finally resumed on Saturday to recover losses.""Local sources said that pomegranates had piled up in the orchards and if not sold soon, will rot, causing losses. So farmers and traders were left with no choice but to go ahead with trade.Soybean is ready for harvest in most parts of Baramati , and growers are likely to face losses if auction is not held.Even auctions of foodgrains like wheat, jowar, bajra, maize and soybean were completely halted for a week. The agriculture produce market committee said that supply of foodgrain dropped by almost 50% in last 10 days, and even traders were not unwilling to auction off their produce at lower prices. The committee was hopeful that action would resume on Monday. Local sources in Junnar-Ambegaon-Khed , which is predominantly known for cultivation of vegetables, said despite a good yield, business has taken a hit.Meanwhile, the government's latest move of increasing withdrawal limits for farmers, to Rs25,000, was met with scepticism. ""Cash is not available at most banks. Farmers cannot spend the entire day standing in queues in banks. Also, there are limited branches of nationalized banks in rural parts so farmers are badly hit,"" said Ashok Banker , a resident of Ambegaon area."

In November 2008, on one such road near Bhadutola, then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industries minister Nirupam Sen and Union ministers Jitin Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan narrowly escaped a Maoist ambush. This sparked police excesses, particularly in Chotopeliya village, which triggered the Lalgarh movement in which 700 lives were lost over the next three years.In 2011, top Maoist leader Kishenji was killed near another tarred road not far from Bhadutola. Theres been peace and some development in this forest region since then. But demonetisation has stalled all that for now.For workers building a 10 km road project near Bhadutola, November 9 was to be the weekly pay day. Narendra Modis announcement on Nov 8, demonetising Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, put paid to it. The contractors decided to keep their cash.Since then, the project has been running on credit. Labourers, JCB operators and truck drivers have not been paid any money since November 8.We were last paid 15 days ago, says Sudha Singh of Chaita village. Asked how they have been managing, Sudhas wife Ashalata pointed to a kirana shop. Its shutters were down. The kirana shop used to give us credit. However, even he has stopped giving now. Now, we ask the upper caste farmers for food on credit.Munna Mitra, the contractor, pleads helplessness. Im operating even the JCBs on credit. On Thursday morning, the workers rebelled against me seeking credit. If I dont get any money, how can I pay them?The solitary bank in Bhadutola, which serves 28 villages, is giving out only Rs 2,000 notes or tattered Rs 20 and Rs 50 notes. Who will give me vegetables if I hand him a Rs 2,000 note? And wholl take tattered Rs 20 and Rs 50 notes, grumbled Kartik Singh of Chaita village.Agriculture has come to a standstill in this part of Bengal. Not all farmers tilling their fields for potato have Kisan Credit Cards, which have been made mandatory for withdrawing Rs 25,000 per week as per the new rules introduced last Thursday. I am not able to buy fertiliser, said marginal farmer Soumendranath Khamrai, who does not have the card.A group of 30 Banjaras, a nomadic tribe, have camped near the tarred road near Bhadutola, making and selling plaster of Paris dolls. But sales have been poor and they are now contemplating shifting to another village. Our dolls cost Rs 60-Rs 80. We dont accept bigger notes. Our sales have dropped. We should move to a newer place. But its the same everywhere, right? sighs Manju Devi."

But we have to make immediate payments to labourers and also need cash for purchasing diesel and to pay EMIs for our tractor loans. However, traders are exploiting us, said Bherulal Patidar, a farmer. He had brought dollar chana to the mandi.Farmers Afzal Patel and Jaiprakash Choudhary also made similar allegations.Traders, however, refuted the allegations. A trader Dinesh said they were compelled to make payment in cheques as withdrawal limit for the registered traders is increased to just Rs 50,000.With that meager amount we cannot buy chana in cash, he said.Krishi upaj mandi secretary G K Choudhary said that he would inquire into the complaints and take action if needed.Businesses at some of the major wholesale markets in MP including Choithram mandi in Indore and red chilli mandi in Khargone is limping along due to severe cash crunch following scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.To tide over the situation, the farmers say, transactions are increasingly being done partly in demonetised currencies and partly in new notes, besides credit.In most cases, payments are being made half in new currency notes and half in old currency notes. Lots of commodities are also being supplied on credit, Mukesh Patidar, a farmer, said.Traders at Choithram mandi say business there is down by about 50 percent since the Union governments demonetisation announcement and that is without counting severely hit potato-onion trade.To keep the vegetable supply chain running, the commission agents, who act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders, are dealing in both scrapped notes and credit.While affluent farmers always supply goods on credit, the small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Today, there is shortage of new currency notes and not all farmers accept cheques, a commission agent, who did not wish to be named, told HT.The potato and onion market in Choithram mandi has been closed for the past one week and is expected to reopen on Monday.Farmers in Bedia in Khargone district, the red chili hub of Madhya Pradesh, are also facing similar problems. The commission agents are offering about Rs 1,000 per quintal more if farmers accept old currency notes, said Krishanpal Singh, a farmer.However, Khargone mandi secretary V K Choudhary said that payments are now being made by cheques and any complaint of exploitation of farmers will be dealt with strictly."

Compare this with prices just a month ago, when tomato was retailing at Rs. 30 a kg. While a good yield over the last one month has normalised supply, tomato growers have now been affected by the post- demonetisation cash crunch.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to States such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and in case of tomato, even to Kolkata.Supply of tomatoes to Tamil Nadu was affected during the Cauvery crisis. Now there is cash crunch, and transportation has been hit, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato grower from Nukkanahalli in Kolar disitrct, and added that farmers were suffering huge losses.Vegetable prices have also been crashing: a kg of beans is now selling at Rs. 14, onion at Rs. 16 and potato at Rs. 26. The prices took a hit over the last two weeks. This is despite the fact that November and December usually see vegetables retailing at higher prices in Bengaluru.The prices have come down by over 30 per cent in the last week alone, said a senior official heading the vegetable procurement section in a leading retail chain.Keshav S.H., manager, Marketing, Hopcoms, said that another reason for the falling prices has been falling retail sales, indicating lower consumption of vegetables, creating a high supply and low demand cycle.However, procurement officials fear that the supply-demand cycle may soon be reversed if the cash crunch continues for a longer period, affecting crop patterns.Now, vegetable growers are resorting to distress sale. But they are not being paid for their produce immediately, further worsening the cash crunch. If this affects sowing this season, then we will soon stare at low supplies and skyrocketing prices, the official said.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to markets"

ReMS, which has conducted the survey and analysed market data in the week preceding demonetisation and a week after that, revealed that during November 1-8, a total of 74,619 lots were traded against 48,892 lots during November 9-16, showing a decline of 34 per cent in market arrivals.About 75 per cent lots varied from one quintal to five quintals. The survey also shows that the pre-demonetisation period was dominated by cash-based payment system to farmers while the post-demonetisation period is seeing a shift to other payment methods.Owing to the liquidity crunch, payments to farmers have been made largely through real time gross settlement (RTGS) and cheques. I think post-demonetisation, online payments in markets will gain momentum, said Mr. Rajan.Surge in online salesData analysis in APMC markets revealed that small farmers are using the online marketing platform to sell their produce. Analysis of the 16-day trading in APMCs indicated that small farmers have supplied about 75 per cent of the lots in the range of one quintal to five quintals using the online platform.A total of 29 lakh farmers have been registered for online payment in APMCs.Now that traders and commission agents have started paying in bank cheques, as an immediate measure, Manoj Rajan, Managing Director, and CEO, ReMS, and Additional Secretary, Agricultural Marketing Department, wants banks to open extension counters at markets to enable farmers to withdraw cash.He said banks and financial institutions can launch a series of commodity pledge schemes, either to individual farmers or a group of farmers.Prices nearly stableThere was no major change in the prices of commodities in the 16-day period. However, in some markets, prices of some commodities shot up.Maize prices moved up by 10 per cent in Hubballi and Gadag while there was a marginal increase in prices of Bengal gram in Bidar, cotton in Raichur and onion in Hubballi and Raichur, Mr. Rajan said.Prices tur dal declined by 10 per cent in Kalaburagi and groundnut by 15 per cent in Davanagere.

The sluggish acreage is going to affect production of the early variety (jaldi aloo) that usually reaches the market by mid-November.But this was not expected when Bengal farmers, the second tuber producing state after Uttar Pradesh , had made huge profits in the last season. ""The November chill is ideal for potato farming. But where is the money?"" said potato grower Kinkar Das from Tarakeswar. Kinkar hasn't been able to sow potato seeds entirely in his 2.5 bigha land. ""I sowed in only 1.5 bigha, leaving the remaining for less expensive farming such as brinjals and radish,"" Das said.Gopinath Khanrui from Singur has major stakes this year. Unable to get credit from the Krishi Samabay Samiti, Gopinath has arranged for Rs 60,000 by mortgaging his wife's gold jewellery and the rest as loan from seed and fertiliser agents. A small section without having bankable assets has taken loans from big farmers and money lenders at 10-12% monthly interest, a trend that is a cause of worry for the administration. State officials fear that such high stakes may increase the possibility of farmer suicides.Seed and fertiliser agents have no other option to give the items on credit. ""If we don't, our business is going to suffer. What's the use of having unused stocks when seeds have a limited shelf life. We are thus giving the items to farmers based on a written undertaking that they will pay back during the harvesting season,"" said trader Pradyut Das. Even seed and fertiliser prices have recorded a dip due to the liquidity crunch. The Punjab Potato Seed Federation has already approached Bengal agents with a request to collect the money from farmers in old currency notes. West Bengal Potato Seed Trader Association secretary Swapan Samanta who is also the Tarakeswar Municipality chairman, however, isn't taking chances. ""I have intimated the state government about the proposal and am waiting for the response. I came to know that the Punjab government has endorsed the move.

Fruit sales, especially those of apples, have gone down by 80%.The sale of vegetables has also taken a hit but not as severely as that of fruits. The retail price of vegetables like potatoes has gone down by about 50% though demand remains more or less constant. As a result, apart from farmers, migrant labourers are hard hit by the sudden turn of events. According to traders, 60% of migrant labourers have returned to their home states.Rajesh Yadav, CEO, Agriculture Produce Marketing Community (APMC), Sahibabad wholesale vegetable and fruit market, said that 1,156 quintals of fruits were sold between November 1 and 8 while between November 15 and 22 the figure nosedived to 390 quintals. ""The same is true in the case of oranges, banana, pomegranate and guava, which saw a dip of about 70% post-demonetisation,"" Yadav said.Rashid Qureshi, manager of MKC Agro Fresh Fruits Ltd, said that normally 100 to 125 trucks laden with fruits like apples, oranges, banana, pomegranate and guava would come to the Sahibabad mandi but after demonetisation on average only 25 trucks are coming in. ""This being the wedding season our sales should have gone up but demonetisation has upset our applecart and many small traders would take several months to recover from the ongoing shock,"" Qureshi said.MKC Agro Fresh Fruits Ltd, one of the biggest wholesale dealers in fruits at the Sahibabad mandi, used to do business worth about Rs 50,000 per day during normal days but, after demonetisation, business has not exceeded beyond Rs 15,000 on any given day, according to Qureshi.As for vegetables, the overall prices have come down Vegetables like potato, onion, cabbage and tomato are still witnessing steady supply,"" Yadav said.""On Tuesday 2,586 quintals of potato found its way into the Sahibabad mandi and the average in the last week roughly comes to around 2,000 quintals a day though the retail price has come done drastically,"" Yadav said.According to Yadav, 1kg of potato before demonetisation came for about Rs 30 but after demonetisation it is now being sold at Rs 15/kg. ""Similarly, cabbage before demonetisation was sold at Rs 20 per kg which has now come down to Rs 4 /kg and tomato has come down to Rs 8/kg from Rs 18/kg,"" Yadav said.Explaining consumer behaviour in the backdrop of demonetisation, said, ""Since there is dearth of cash in the system because of demonetisation, consumers tend to spend only on essential items such as vegetables and they are saving on liquid cash by doing without fruits.

They said that the supply of fruits and vegetables to the wholesale market is gradually decreasing.Rajesh Yadav, the secretary of agriculture produce marketing committee, said, The prices of vegetables have dipped a bit while those of fruits have remained stable. However, the sale of fruits has dipped as consumers are mostly buying only vegetables, for daily consumption. The arrival of apples from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Himachal Pradesh dipped considerably after November 8.As per official data, 1,774 truckloads of fruits and vegetables arrived in the first eight days of November, at an average of around 222 loads per day. However, the number of truckloads that arrived from November 9 to November 21 was 2,659, down to an average of 205 loads per day.Officials said that most transactions in the market took place in cash, but now, the traders are depending on the supply of stock on credit as well.As of now, I have nearly Rs1 crore in rotation on account of supplying on credit. Not even a single person came to remit cash on Tuesday. Whenever I approach them, they say they dont have enough cash. The sale of fruits is down by 70%-80% and we have also stopped asking for the supply of apple from J&K. The sale of apple, grapes and oranges has been considerably affected, Raees Ahmad, owner of Sangam Fruits at the market, said.Munim Zafar of Madina Fruit Company said, We used to procure nearly 500kg-700kg of kinu (kinnow fruit) from Punjab. Now, the procurement is around 200kg per day. Consumers dont have much cash-in-hand to buy from here. Generally, we used to order two-three truckloads (of fruits) per day, but we ordered just one truckload in the last three days.Wholesalers said that farmers are also losing money due to dip in sales as they have to pay for parking the truck in the market for additional days.To move our stock, we are selling potato at Rs12-15 per kg against the rate of Rs30 per kg prior to the demonetisation move. Similarly, we are selling cauliflower at Rs2 per kg against Rs20 per kg earlier. Tomato prices have also reduced from Rs20 per kg to Rs8 per kg. This has also led consumers to purchase basic vegetables to meet daily food demand, Haji Sajjad, a wholesaler, said.According to official figures, the market received around 168 quintals (1 quintal = 100kg) of apples per day in the first week of November. The supply dipped to an average of 93 quintals per day from November 9 to November 22. The supply of oranges also dipped from an average of 453 quintals per day to an average of 306 quintals per day, after November 8.However, the supply of guava has remained constant, at 220 quintals per day, from November 1 to November 22."
281,Cash crunch hits Himachal potato growers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/Cash-crunch-hits-Himachal-potato-growers/article16685249.ece,2016-11-23,The Hindu,"Hardly any trader is buying potatoes in this Himachal Pradesh town this season owing to the cash crunch after demonetisation of high-value currency notes. Normally, potatoes here sell like hot cakes.There is hardly any wholesaler or agro commodity trading house to buy potatoes in this area. Most of the farmers have been forced to sell the produce at rates almost less than the actual cost of production, Najaib Gill, a prominent potato grower on the outskirts of Una town, told IANS.He said this is the season when potatoes grown in low hills of the State, mainly in Una district, command monopoly in the markets of north Indian states of Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and Delhi.He said there is a huge demand for the potatoes in the plains.Since the production (in the hills) is optimal and the demand is high in the plains, we are not getting adequate prices as the traders say they have no cash in new currency notes, he added.Potato is one of the major cash crops grown in the lower and mid-hills of the State. Una district alone harvests potatoes on 700 hectares.The States potato yield was around 200,000 tonnes in 2015-16, while estimates this fiscal put the produce at 195,000 tonnes, according to the Himachal Pradesh Economic Survey for 2015-16.Besides Una district, the table potato is also cultivated in Bilaspur, Kangra, Mandi, Shimla, Solan and Kullu districts.The Lahaul Valley in Lahaul-Spiti district is known for producing virus-free potatoes that mainly find a market for plantation.Sarvjit Singh Dogra, state Agricultural Produce Market Committee Secretary in Una town, told IANS that a 50-kg bag of potatoes is fetching between Rs 400 and Rs 425 in Una, while it sold for around Rs 800 last year.Currently, potatoes are being retailed at Rs 30-35 per kg across the country.Growers are facing many hardships. Many are being forced to accept old currency notes.For more than a week there was no bulk buyer for potato. Finally, we have decided to sell the entire produce at almost half the rates by accepting old currency notes of Rs 1,000 denomination, said a farmer, requesting anonymity.He said if the government could allow use of old high denomination notes for purchasing seeds, it should also be liberal with the growers for accepting the banned notes for their produce till the new currency is in full circulation.Field reports say most of the farmers have delayed the harvesting of the potatoes till the prices spike again.Last week, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh expressed concern over lack of enthusiasm among the traders during centuries-old Lavi Fair, synonymous with trade in traditional items like hand-knitted woollens, farm implements and dry fruits as well as horses, yaks, sheep, at Rampur town, some 130 km from the state capital.The fair too was hit hard by the demonetisation decision.Its unfortunate that this year the trade fair was hit by the demonetisation of currency notes. People showed less enthusiasm during the fair as compared to previous years due the Centres decision, the Chief Minister said at the fairs closing ceremony.Himachal Pradesh annually earns Rs 2,500 crore from the cultivation of vegetables, while horticulture generates more than Rs 3,200 crore annually.-IANS"
282,Paddy alert in Bengal,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161123/jsp/nation/story_120840.jsp,2016-11-23,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Nov. 22: Around 35 per cent of the monsoon paddy in Bengal could go waste because of the demonetisation drive, an agriculture department estimate has suggested. However, against the backdrop of chief minister Mamata Banerjee's vocal opposition to the domonetisation, a section of officials in Nabanna, the Bengal secretariat, felt it was ""a bit early"" to forecast crop losses. Nabanna sources said the department drew up a report on the basis of feedback from all the districts. The government sought the report to gauge the impact of the demonetisation on the harvesting of the monsoon paddy. After the Centre recalled the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, reports poured in from rural Bengal that farmers could not harvest the produce as they had no money to pay the daily labourers. ""The estimates mentioned in the report suggest that there could be a loss of 35 per cent of the total paddy produced in the kharif season. If the crop is not harvested, it will rot in the fields. If the situation does not change dramatically, the state's total rice production is bound to be hit this year,"" a senior Nabanna official said. According to agriculture department officials, if the kharif crop is not harvested by the end of November, the total production is affected. ""If the farmers keep paddy in the fields till the end of November, a large portion of the grain will fall off because of the changing weather conditions..... It will result in crop loss,"" another official said. This would mean the farmers will face difficulties in recovering their investments. Potato cultivation would also suffer if the kharif paddy is not harvested by the end of November, the sources said. ""The sowing of potato seeds needs to be completed by mid-December for a healthy production. If the kharif paddy remains in the fields till the end of November, farmers would not get time to prepare the fields to grow potato,"" an official said. Some Nabanna officials said the report was based on estimates and the final production amount would be calculated only after the harvesting is completed. ""It is a bit early to say that the state is going to face huge crop loss,"" an agriculture department official said. The report will be sent to the Centre tomorrow. The major chunk of the yearly paddy production is done in the kharif season. Bengal produces about 158 lakh tonnes of rice annually, of which 110 lakh tonnes are harvested in the kharif season. The annual consumption requirement is 150 lakh tonnes. ""If 35 per cent of the kharif crop gets destroyed, the total rice production this year will come down to about 120 lakh tonnes,"" a source said. ""Farmers usually sell the boro (winter) paddy before the Pujas to meet festival expenses and the cost of harvesting the kharif crop. Most of the cash in the possession of farmers has become useless because of the demonetisation. So they have not been able to hire labourers for harvesting,"" the source said. The agriculture department officials said the effect was already evident in the sluggish sales of potato seeds at state government centres."

ReMS, which has conducted the survey and analysed market data in the week preceding demonetisation and a week after that, revealed that during November 1-8, a total of 74,619 lots were traded against 48,892 lots during November 9-16, showing a decline of 34 per cent in market arrivals.About 75 per cent lots varied from one quintal to five quintals.The survey also shows that the pre-demonetisation period was dominated by cash-based payment system to farmers while the post-demonetisation period is seeing a shift to other payment methods.Owing to the liquidity crunch, payments to farmers have been made largely through real time gross settlement and cheques. I think post-demonetisation, online payments in markets will gain momentum, said Mr. Rajan.Surge in online salesData analysis in APMC markets revealed that small farmers are using the online marketing platform to sell their produce.Analysis of the 16-day trading in APMCs indicated that small farmers have supplied about 75 per cent of the lots in the range of one quintal to five quintals using the online platform.A total of 29 lakh farmers have been registered for online payment in APMCs.Now that traders and commission agents have started paying in bank cheques, as an immediate measure, Manoj Rajan, Managing Director, and CEO, ReMS, and Additional Secretary, Agricultural Marketing Department, wants banks to open extension counters at markets to enable farmers to withdraw cash.He said banks and financial institutions can launch a series of commodity pledge schemes, either to individual farmers or a group of farmers.There was no major change in the prices of commodities in the 16-day period. However, in some markets, prices of some commodities shot up. Maize prices moved up by 10 per cent in Hubballi and Gadag while there was a marginal increase in prices of Bengal gram in Bidar, cotton in Raichur and onion in Hubballi and Raichur, Mr. Rajan said.Prices toor dal declined by 10 per cent in Kalaburagi and groundnut by 15 per cent in Davanagere. Prices of potato went down five per cent in Bengaluru."

Shortage of valid currency in rural areas has affected the purchase of tomatoes in the wholesale market, leading to a price crash.Tomato is now fetching farmers as little as Rs 2-3.5 a kg. With the cost of production being Rs 10 a kg, farmers are losing up to Rs 8 a kg. Officials from Girnare market in Nashik say 1.5 lakh crates of 20kg each come to the market every day. The rate prior to demonetisation was between Rs 8 and Rs 9kg. But now with the shortage of the new currency, traders are insisting that farmers accept payment in old notes. And because farmers are refusing, they have slashed prices,"" an official from the market committee said.Farmers said since the auction had been stalled in these market yards for the past one week, they have had to throw a lot of their produce away as they cannot store this perishable item. Babanrao Lahane, a farmer, said he had to throw away 40 crates of tomatoes due to low sales last week. ""I have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 35,000 per acre. I continue to get affected by the low sale price.""Traders said since most of them had accounts in district cooperative banks, it was hard to withdraw cash. So they too are forced to work with old notes. Cooperative banks have been barred from exchanging old notes and are also carrying out limited transactions.Meanwhile, arrival of fresh crop lowered prices further.Abundant supplies are arriving at Vashi APMC market from Nashik. The wholesale rate has dropped from Rs 7-10 per kg a fortnight ago to Rs 5-7. Retail rates have fallen from Rs 15-20 to Rs 10-14 respectively.""Over 45-55 truckloads of good quality tomatoes are arriving daily from Nashik, which seems to be in surplus compared to the demand in the Mumbai metropolitan region. So prices are low and will remain so,"" said trader Balasaheb Badade.Also, since Monday, green peas have been getting cheaper.""Farmers have started harvesting the new crop, causing a drop in rates,"" said Mandar Jadhav , a retailer.Prices of other vegetables are fluctuating on a daily basis by Rs 5-10 a kg. There was a rumour that prices of potatoes and onions have dropped substantially . Dismissing it, Ashok Walunj, former APMC director, said, ""Since the last month, prices of onions and potatoes have stayed constant at Rs 7-14 and 812 respectively at APMC.""Onion auction called off over money woesNashik: Auction of onions was cancelled at the Lasalgaon APMC on Wednesday due to non-availability of cash in traders' bank accounts. However, an APMC official assured that the auction would reopen at the country's largest onion market on Thursday. The Lasalgaon APMC had suspended onion auction for almost eight days, from November 10 to 17, due to cash crunch."

However, she was forced to sell her goods at throwaway prices and discard the remaining, as there were very few customers.Shinde is one of the villagers who have been hit hard by the cash crunch following the demonetisation of big currencies.Madhukarrao Kagale (65), a farmer, said, ""This is the worst time to be a farmer . We have returned to the times when all of us were happy eating zunka bhakar . The only difference this time around is that we have to eat zunka bhakar forcibly and that too once a day.""For Shinde, it was the second consecutive weekly market that disappointed her. ""A few days ago, a bunch of 'methi' would fetch us around Rs 10, but now we are forced to sell it for Rs 3-4. The prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes too have come down to Rs 10 or Rs 20 per kg . We cannot afford to sell in these rates, but there is no other alternative,"" she added.Shanta Sonali, another vegetable vendor, the number of sellers have decreased by at least 30 percent this week. If the same situation prevails, only 40-50 percent might turn up for the weekly bazaar next week, she said.Vishwas Khot, a farmer, said that earlier milk cooperative society gave hard cash, but since the agents and the society is short of cash, the money is being deposited in their accounts at the Kolhapur district bank, which itself is out of cash.""We have money. Believe me, that is not an issue. The fact that we cannot use it or withdraw it is biting hard. We are making our daily sale on credit, but how long can we do that. What are we supposed to do,"" he asked.Rajendra Chougule, another villager, said that in Yalgud village, 75 percent of the residents' accounts are in the district bank. ""We live in a village and that is why at least the grocery shopowner can give us essential goods on credit.""Tukaram Hanbar said banks are giving only Rs 1,000 and that too not regularly.

The shortage could be compounded by the fact that agricultural Rabi season is set to begin and farmers will require cash credit of over Rs 1,000 crore latest by December 8. Apprehensive of the possibility of currency shortage looming large, the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) has already sent out an SOS to RBI, asking the central body to infuse adequate cash by the end of the next week. The chief general manager of SBI, Partha Pratim Sengupta, confirmed cash withdrawal rate usually shot up in the first week of every month. ""Pensioners gets money in the first week. After the pension gets credited to their accounts, they prefer to withdraw most of it in cash. We hope money supply would go up next week, only then would the situation be under control,"" he said. The RBI, in its latest circular on November 24, advised banks to take appropriate steps to meet likely demands for cash by pensioners. The banking circles feel additional Rs 500 notes, adding up to Rs 450 croreRs 500 crore, would be required to care to customers in the next one week.A top SLBC official agreed that the liquidity situation had certainly improved after the second tranche of the new Rs 500 notes reached RBI but pointed out that the real test would be in the first week of December.""Sowing of Rabi crop has not started yet and farmers will have to start sowing potato by December 10. There is an urgent need of Rs 1,500 crore agro credit in the state, most of which has to be disbursed in cash,"" the official said. He added that SLBC had already briefed the RBI and the central observer about the scene. ""We are in discussion with the RBI. The central bank is also trying to organise more cash,"" he said.The president of All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), Rajen Nagar , also feared that trouble at banks, already grappling with low cash, could escalate at the beginning of the next month. "" Apart from pensioners, both state and Centre will divert a lot of cash to rural economy . There could be shortage of currency in the city,"" he said. Even Bandhan Bank MD and CEO C S Ghosh seemed concerned about the first week of December though he said the scene had drastically improved since last two weeks.An SBI official pointed out that withdrawal had started going up and another official indicated that the it could be 20%25% more in the first week of December. ""We may land up with an average daily withdrawal of Rs 700 crore, at least for the first few days. It will be a tough ask,"" he added."
289,Concerns and challenges,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/583127/concerns-challenges.html,2016-11-25,Deccan Herald,"Commander (rtd) Chaitanya Chandel and Bidanda Chengappa Nov 26, 2016, 0:09 ISTAfter the 26/11 strike, though Navy is designated as nodal coastal security agency, it is not operationally oriented to take up this task.Today, coastal security remains as vulnerable to sea-borne threats as when Ajmal Kasab and his cohorts landed ashore and threatened Mumbai eight years ago on November 26, 2008.While the Indian Navy (IN), the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and the state police forces handle operations at sea, a multiplicity of agencies like the Department of Fisheries, mercantile marine departments of the coastal states, Director General Lighthouses, Ministry of Shipping and the Department of Ports among a host of others are stakeholders. Therefore, coastal security is a shared responsibility not limited solely to the IN, ICG and state police.Coastal security straddles both the military and police roles and therefore needs a force that can operate both like the navy as well as the police. Globally, the coast guard is the force of choice that carries out this role being inferior to the navy in war-fighting capabilities but superior to the police in training and firepower, besides airborne and marine platforms.However, today, both the ICG and IN lack the legal powers to arrest and hold boats and personnel at sea. Operationally, the powers to file a First Information Report (FIR) from the sea, as well as to seize and detain personnel and boats are essential to fulfil the police function of this role. There is also a need to streamline the process to hand over the FIR, personnel, boats and contraband/ material from the IN or CG to the police for further action under the Indian Criminal Procedure Code.After the 26/11 sea-borne terrorist strike, though the IN is designated as the nodal coastal security agency, it is not operationally oriented to take up this task. The IN is primarily oriented and equipped for a war-fighting role. Its professional expertise is to sail the high seas beyond 200 nautical miles and engage hostile vessels either during war or peace. On the other hand, coastal security also requires intensive patrolling from the coastline to 12 nautical miles where the waters are dense with smaller craft which sail in this marine space.It is estimated that around 2.5 lakh small boats and vessels ply these waters for fishing and transport. The state police forces are supposed to patrol these coastal waters to pre-empt illegal activities as well as the movement of terrorists.Unfortunately, the state police is a land-oriented force and unable to cope with the marine environment. The police are dependent on the IN and ICG who have adequate exposure at sea and the capability to cope with eventualities there. The ICG has a charter to concentrate on the sea between 12 to 200 nautical miles and therefore cannot constantly check the large volume of smaller boats that ply between the coastline and 12 nautical miles that have the potential to transport terrorists or contraband.To manage coastal security operations across peninsular India, it is necessary to establish state-level operations rooms with cross-functional teams from all agencies involved which will prove a force multiplier for the ICG. There is also a ne-ed to supplement the existing infrastructure for logistics, technical support and training as well as optimise the use of existing boats and assets. Experience with the IN and ICG can be used to improve procurement of equipment with an indi-genous focus which can be supported in the country. This will help alleviate problems with equipment maintenance and spares those coastal police forces face.It seems logical that boat movement into and out of Indian waters needs to be regulated to ensure coastal security. However, no progress has been made towards tracking fishing boats. This remains a contentious issue and a political hot potato since large fishing fleet owners contribute to party election funds.In itself, this single lacuna nullifies pro-gress made on every other front. It needs to be understood that every fishing boat that is tracked becomes part of the coast-al security system. Every boat logged into the system amounts to a pair of eyes and ears at sea. Conversely, every boat not in the system remains a potential threat.Information sharingThe problems of information sharing and maritime domain awareness can be solved with technologies like Geographic Information Systems and knowledge management systems which would help share operations plots and specialised knowledge currently with each agency.They would also provide common platforms to bring together operational and support agencies, besides creating synergy, to enable free flow of information and enhance transparency. Today, much more needs to be done in the areas of information and plot sharing among various agencies which continue to remain isolated from each other.The technology and capability to do so is available within the country and must be used as far as possible to avoid reliance on foreign vendors. New breakthroughs in technology make fishing boat tracking and communications at the national scale an exciting field. While costs remain a concern, making this field a focus area for startups through provision of tax breaks should help to produce breakthroughs.Over the last eight years, there has been considerable progress on coastal security over intelligence sharing and inter-agency communication at the national level. Today, coastal security remains New Delhi-centric where the cabinet secretary annually chairs a few meetings of the National Committee on Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security.However, the nine coastal state governments and four Union Territories relate to coastal security with varying degrees of seriousness. This is evident from the reports of the audits of Comptroller and Auditor General that highlight unspent budgets. Moreover, the state of boats, equipment and police organisational structure does not inspire confidence that security cannot be breached along the countrys 7,516-km coastline.(Chandel is involved with technology development for coastal security and Chengappa is a Professor of International Relations and Strategic Studies, Christ University, Bengaluru)"

At the farm level, however, there is a crisis of capital that continues to bother tuber growers even after the Centre's assurance of giving fresh loans to farmers for the sowing and harvesting season. Potato may pinch pockets in the coming season as there has been a drop in its acreage.Tarakeswar Aloo Byabsayee Samity secretary Swapan yee Samity secretary Swapan Samanta put it straight. ""I have come to know that 359 Krishi Samabay Samitis in the Hooghly district will get Rs 50,000 each. If this works out, the total amount adds up to around Rs 2 crore. The outgo as loans during the last season was Rs 212 crore. The KSUs can't disburse the paltry loan amount on their own.They have to give names and address of the farmers and send the list to the central cooperative bank in the district.The bank won't sanction lo ans to those who have taken loans earlier,"" Samanta said.A back-of-the-envelope calculation gives a feel of the calculation gives a feel of the ground reality . ""Potato cultivation for a bigha costs a farmer an average Rs 20,000. I have five bighas and I need Rs 1 lakh for the farming. But the KSU has a total kitty of Rs 50,000. It can meet only a small fraction of the demand.Farmers can't wait. Some have bought seeds and the minimum fertiliser on credit making a payment assurance of Rs 50-100 more after the yield.Some have left parts of their land empty . The result is for all to guess,"" Samanta said.While Hooghly farmers have got a hint of the Centre's loan disbursement, Burdwan district magistrate Soumitra Mohan hasn't got any such communication. ""I am not aware of any such communication to the central cooperative bank till date,"" the DM said. Bankura district officials also sounded non-committal.This has left the potato growers in vast stretches of Joypur, Simplipal and other parts of Jangalmahal in the lurch."

He sold them for Rs 12 per kg. A week later, it was a dramatically different situation. The price had crashed to Rs 4 per kg. ""Nobody's picking up the stuff in the mandi now. Nuksan ho raha hai (I am suffering losses). The mandi guys are telling me that with shortage of currency, there's little demand at the retail level,"" he says.Another farmer, Virendra Dahiya, said, he had wholesaled the same vegetable for Rs 15 per kg at the mandi before the stunning currency measure announced on Nov 8 and has now been trading them for Rs 9-10 per kg.Those standing in the long queues before a PNB branch complain that cash comes and vanishes with the speed of a rumour.Currency shortage seems to have caused a ripple effect down the supply chain. And the consequence can be seen at the bottom of the pyramid.Ajaypal, who mainly grows vegetables over 16 bighas of land owned jointly by four brothers, is making adjustments to beat the blowback of notebandi, the term everyone uses to describe demonetization in these parts of rurban south-west Delhi.Another batch of cauliflowers would have been ready for the market in a couple of days. But the 46-year-old Jat farmer has stopped watering the plants. ""That would delay their growth. I want to hold on for a fortnight. Maybe we will get a better price after that,"" he says.A similar tactic to beat the falling rates has been employed by Jagbir Singh, a Jat farmer with 15 bighas of land in Asra, a village located in west UP's Hapur district. ""I will not harvest potato for 8-10 days. Let them stay where they are till the mandi rates improve,"" he told TOI last week.Once he has disposed of the cauliflowers and the radish, Ajaypal will sow tomatoes and peas. Like many in these parts with a cash flow problem, he is relying on the bond of traditional association that gets him seeds and fertilisers on loan. ""That's part of our dealings every year,"" he says. Dahiya says credit is part of every transaction in this urban village poised on the edge of south-west Delhi. ""Yahan to kirayedaar ka bhi udhaar chalta hai (Even the tenants pay you later,"") he says.Part of Ajaypal's land is fallow at the moment. He has just harvested jowar and now is ready to sow wheat. He's behind schedule by about 10-15 days. ""I will plant a late variety of wheat to compensate,"" the farmer says.Normally, at this time about 20 people would have been working in the field, says the farmer. But the delay means there are only two farmhands at work on Thursday after noon.Ajaypal pays them Rs 250 for a day's work. But he is unable to pay them in cash right now. Overall, he owes about Rs 4,000 to his other regulars who are now working elsewhere, he says. How much do the shortage of money and the losses bother him? His feelings are mixed. ""No 2 ke paise ko lagaam lag rahi hai (Black money is being brought under control),"" he says.Life is more difficult for Sharmila Devi, one of two daily wagers still working in Ajaypal's field. These days she carries vegetables home as part of her payment. Call it a form of barter or good old jugaad, adjustments like these keep the wheels turning for the marginal and the marginalized in times of the scarce rupee."
292,"Want to break Rs 2,000 note? First spend half of it",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Want-to-break-Rs-2k-note-First-spend-half-of-it/articleshow/55627406.cms,2016-11-26,The Times Of India,"good for taking selfies +PUNE: The crisp, pink Rs 2,000 note that has been in circulation since the government demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes may be, but probably not much more.Many Punekars are unwilling to accept the note from banks and ATMs as they ending up spending a lot of it just to get some change.Milind Verma, who lives with his wife in the Kothrud area, wanted change for the note. Since no one was willing, he ended up buying chicken worth Rs 700.""I went to many shops, mainly those selling vegetables, but all declined. Their demand was simple: buy things worth Rs 800, and we will provide change. Not knowing what to do, I ended up at a meat shop and asked for 1kg of chicken, which costs around Rs 110. The seller refused too. Ultimately, I had to buy chicken worth Rs 700, besides vegetables. Since we are just two people in my house, we gave some chicken to our neighbour. One cannot have chicken for an entire week, but now we are forced to,"" Milind said.Aruna Kale, from Vimannagar , said she was facing similar issues.""Banks, whether public or private, prefer giving currency notes of Rs 2,000 stating that they don't have notes of lower denominations. This has led to problems, with only a few willing to give change even after so many days. In my area, vegetable vendors ask customers to buy huge amounts of vegetables and fruits if we want to break this note for change. Why should I buy 6kg to 7kg of potatoes when I don't need it? They have been asking us to spend at least Rs 800 if we want change for Rs 2,000. At last, I was forced to order food from a restaurant for Rs 500 to get change,"" Aruna, who stays with her family, told TOI.A vegetable seller at the Deccan market gave two reasons for this behaviour.""How are we supposed to give change for Rs 2,000 if one buys vegetables worth Rs 200 or Rs 300? If the cash problem and scarcity of Rs 100 notes is bothering people, it is a cause of worry for us too. It isn't a rule, but if one buys things worth more than Rs 600, it is good for us as giving change is easier since new notes worth Rs 500 have been introduced only now and are fewer in the market. One can always stock vegetables and since winter has set, it will not perish easily. Secondly, we have seen news items about fake Rs 2,000 notes already having entered the market. We just don't want to take a chance,"" he said.Sandeep Makode of Salunke Vihar said the crisis has resulted in people spending a lot unnecessarily.""Many shopkeepers now prefer e-wallet payments and don't want to take Rs 2,000. The other day, I had to buy fruits and vegetables for Rs 600 when I want hunting for change for Rs 2,000. This is a loss for middle-class families,"" Makode said."
293,Demonetisation’s short-term cost,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/demonetisations-short-term-cost-4395435/,2016-11-26,Indian Express,"(Illustration by C R Sasikumar) (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)It is now more than two weeks since 8/11 and the government has stopped exchanging notes for cash. Politicians and analysts alike are worried about the short-term costs to the economy, especially the effects on the poor and on the agricultural economy. Former PM Manmohan Singh believes that the cost to the economy may be as much as a two per cent drop in GDP growth rate this year; he also described demonetisation as organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people.Let me first put down the agreements shared by both supporters and critics of de-monetisation (hereafter DM). The known knowns are three. First, that DM was a bold, radical and unprecedented move  there is no template with which to analyse the short-run effects of DM. Second, that implementation could have been possibly much better. A known unknown is the fact that secrecy was of the essence for DM to have any chance of success. And it deserves emphasis that the ministry of finance has never had such an open mind to criticism from the public, and has actually implemented some improvements (like the indelible ink requirement for exchange of cash). Third, and possibly most importantly, no one believes (including myself) that DM will do much to stop the creation of future black money. There will be a mild deterrent effect, but one whose amplitude will fade in a few years  unless accompanied by additional economic reforms.Many believe that besides the inconvenience, the short-run costs to the economy are considerable and will even feed into significant negative effects over the next few years. Politicians (especially of the Mamata and Kejriwal kind, though the Congress is not too far behind) have shouted themselves hoarse as to the costs the poor are paying because of DM. Some brokerage firms (especially the small ones) see this as their Andy Warhol moment; a few days of fame (later ignominy?) can be garnered by making forecasts that are out of the ballpark, if not out of the universe  one brokerage/investment firm has forecast that over the next five months, GDP will register a rate of -2 per cent. The economy grew at 7.5 per cent for seven months (April-October) and will need to grow at -2 per cent to register the Ambit Capital forecast of 3.5 per cent for this fiscal year. (As comparison, the Lehman crisis quarters, 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, registered a growth rate of 1.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively).Some other forecasts are equally dire; we see newspaper headlines that the important rabi crop is in trouble, deep trouble, because of DM. The rural economy is primarily cash-dependent and a Times of India (November 24) front page story stated that job losses (among poor daily wage labourers) were mounting and prices of essential vegetables had dropped significantly between November 16-22. For example, potato prices were down 25 per cent, onion prices were halved, and tomato prices were down only 11 per cent (see table for all-India actual estimates).When poor people lose their jobs, and when land is idle, and/or produce is unmarketed, there could be riots in the streets. There are two short-run indicators of how the public is feeling  by-elections held on November 19, after the earthquake, and the pattern of food prices since November 8.Surprisingly, the voting public is not that angry with the BJP. In by-elections in five constituencies (Lok Sabha and Assembly) across four states in which the BJP was a contender (Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura), the BJP did about as well as the previous election. In three assembly constituencies (Nepanagar, MP, Baithalangso, Assam and Barjala, Tripura), the BJP did much better than previously. This is not supportive of the great DM negativity observed among the media and politicians.The DM-induced cash crunch was expected to considerably slow down the sowing for the rabi crop. Fortunately, and surprisingly, this has not happened. As of November 18, 241.7 million hectares (Mha) had been planted in 2016/17  compared to 243.4 Mha in the previous year. But shouldnt the acreage be more, given that this year was a much better rainfall year than the previous two years? No, because acreage varies little for individual crops, and responds to changes in relative prices. Acreage under pulses and oilseeds has increased significantly, under wheat, it has stayed the same. Furthermore, yield (output) is most affected by rainfall, so a decline is unlikely to be much affected by DM.One important source of information about the effects of DM is the pattern of food prices subsequent to November 8. The DM-induced cash crunch is expected to have two short-run effects on food output and consumption. The first is demand destruction in urban and rural India as consumers just dont have the cash to buy food  this would suggest that food prices should decline. If supply is really affected (supply destruction), then we should expect prices to shoot up. It is impossible to identify which effect is dominant.But attempt to infer we must. Hence, the presentation of detailed price pattern data for food items. For the last six years, the average November price change is reported for identical days across the years. The per cent change reported is between the average price observed across about 15-25 cities in India for each item, that is, brinjal, potatoes, apples, grapes, milk, etc. The data is collected daily. We have taken the median price for each day and each item. The average price for November 1-8 is the reference price; the per cent change reported is between the average median price between November 9-24 and this reference price. (If means are used rather than the median, there is little difference in the results).The reader can make her own inference; all the relevant data is provided. The conclusion we reach is that the net effect of the supply and demand destruction is very little on the price of food observed in urban markets.Let us look at the average change in vegetable and fruit prices. Vegetable prices have fallen by 4.3 per cent, but November is generally a time when vegetable prices decline. In 2011, despite healthy double digit inflation, vegetable prices fell 7.9 per cent; last year, vegetable prices were up 2.8 per cent. Fruit prices (a discretionary luxury food item) show a marginal increase of one per cent; overall food (with consumption weights as in the CPI) prices are down just 0.6 per cent in November.The strong result is that there is no juice for inference about destruction in the rural food economy. This result is not surprising for most agricultural experts  but the noise politicians dont want to hear that which is not convenient to their political ideology.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
294,Cuba’s Fidel Castro made revolutionary mark on history,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/cubas-fidel-castro-made-revolutionary-mark-on-history-4396115/,2016-11-26,Indian Express,"In this April 14, 1966 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro stands on a sugar cane plantation in Cuba.(Roberto Salas/Prensa Latina via AP Images, File) In this April 14, 1966 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro stands on a sugar cane plantation in Cuba.(Roberto Salas/Prensa Latina via AP Images, File)The son of a wealthy landowner, Fidel Castro turned his back on a life of privilege to lead a left-wing revolution in Cuba that endured for decades and was shaped by his political cunning, keen sense of destiny and boundless ego. Castro, who has died at the age of 90, was at once idealistic and pragmatic, sharply intelligent and reckless, charismatic and intolerant.Critics saw in him a stubborn bully who violated human rights, jailed his critics, banned opposition parties and wrecked Cubas economy. Admirers saw a visionary who stood up to US domination of Latin America, brought healthcare and education to the poor, and inspired socialist movements across the world.Even before leading the 1959 revolution that propelled Cuba toward communism and onto the Cold War stage, Castro saw greatness in himself. From an early age, he admired historys boldest figures, particularly Alexander the Great, and believed he and his rebels were part of that tradition. Men do not shape destiny. Destiny produces the man for the moment, he said in 1959.Castro toppled the unpopular US -backed dictator Fulgencio Batista by uniting a disparate opposition and outsmarting a bigger, better-equipped Cuban military. His alliance with the Soviet Union put him at the center of the Cold War, most notably when the 1962 Cuban missile crisis took the world to the brink of nuclear war.He was a global celebrity, his beard, military fatigues and big Cuban cigars making him instantly recognizable. He owed his prominence in part to geography. Looking to bolster an ally just 90 miles (140 km) from Florida, Moscow helped him build socialism by giving him billions of dollars worth of aid and favorable trade, from oil to tractor parts.But Castro also mined Cuban nationalism and Latin American pride, stirring resentment of US power and influence. He managed to preserve his revolution despite constant US hostility even when Cuba reeled from the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, showing the vigor of a man who intended to die in office.Instead, almost killed by a serious intestinal illness, he was forced to step aside in 2006 and he formally handed over to his younger brother, Raul Castro, in 2008.In his final years, Castro wrote opinion columns for Cubas state media but was rarely seen. His famously long speeches gave way to silence, at least in public, and comfortable track suits replaced the stiff black boots and crisp military attire.On Dec. 17, 2014, Raul Castro cut a deal to restore diplomatic ties with the United States. Six weeks later, Fidel Castro offered only lukewarm support, raising questions about whether he approved of ending hostilities with his longtime enemy.PERMANENT STRUGGLEKnown by the militaristic title of El Comandante, in some ways Castro was always replaying the exhilaration of revolt, exhorting Cubans to fight one battle after another, from confronting US hostility to boosting potato production.FILE  In this March 14, 1957 file photo, Fidel Castro, the young anti-Batista guerrilla leader, center, is seen with his brother Raul Castro, left, and Camilo Cienfuegos, right, while operating in the Mountains of Eastern Cuba.

(AP Photo/Andrew St. George, File)He survived numerous assassination attempts and outlasted nine US presidents in power, seizing control of Cuba while Dwight Eisenhower occupied the White House and stepping down during George W Bushs second term.Throughout, Castro lectured Cubans.A magnificent orator who instinctively altered his cadence to fit the moment, he re-trod history and delved deep into detail about Cuban independence heroes, plans to perfect the revolution and the declared evils of US imperialism.Tall and physically commanding, fastidious in his attire, he often built to a crescendo of indignation, gesturing firmly with long-fingered, well-manicured hands.We shall endeavor to be brief, he told the United Nations General Assembly in 1960, then set a record for UN speeches by talking for nearly 4-1/2 hours.Castro never allowed statues of him to be erected or streets to be named after him, saying he did not want a cult of personality. Nevertheless, the cult was everywhere. His image and words were posted on billboards and his name was invoked at every public event.Most Cubans, whether for or against him, refer to him simply as Fidel.He was a night owl. He would keep foreign guests waiting until late at night and then summon them for talks. Even his critics would sometimes find themselves oddly charmed by such encounters.Tad Szulc, a biographer, called him Cubas great master of political seduction.EARLY YEARSBorn on Aug. 13, 1926, Castro grew up as a privileged son on his fathers plantation in the eastern village of Biran, where his playmates were children of impoverished workers living in thatched huts with dirt floors. He said the economic injustice he witnessed there inspired a life-long sympathy for the poor.FILE  In this Oct. 12, 1979 file photo, Cuban President, Fidel Castro, points during his lengthy speech before the United Nations General Assembly, in New York. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler, File) FILE  In this Oct. 12, 1979 file photo, Cuban President, Fidel Castro, points during his lengthy speech before the United Nations General Assembly, in New York. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler, File)He attended the Jesuit-run Belen School in the capital and then studied law at the University of Havana, plunging into the violent politics of the time and starting his drift leftward.Long-winded, intolerant and  unusually for a Cuban  awkward on the dance floor, he was not embraced by his fellow students at first but eventually emerged as a leader.He took part in an aborted 1947 plan to overthrow Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and was at a youth conference in Colombia when riots broke out and some 2,000 people died.After law school, he decided to run for Congress in 1952. When Batista staged a coup and halted the elections, Castro began plotting armed rebellion.In 1953, he led a raid on the Moncada barracks in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba. Dozens of followers died and he, Raul Castro and others were captured and imprisoned.History will absolve me, he declared at his trial.Pardoned in 1955, he went into exile in Mexico where he met Argentine revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara. Together with Raul, they trained a rebel band that in 1956 returned to Cuba aboard an overcrowded yacht called Granma.Ambushed at landing by government troops, only 12 of the 82 rebels on board made it to the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains.Castro denied Batistas claims that he was a communist but decades later he told Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet in a book 100 hours with Fidel that by 1952, I was already a convinced Marxist-Leninist.Whatever the evolution of his views on communism, he was determined to throw off American influence in Cuba. When US-supplied aircraft bombed his rebels in 1958, he vowed revenge.I have sworn that the Americans will pay very dearly for what they are doing, he said in a letter to close friend and aide Celia Sanchez. When this war has ended, a much bigger and greater war will start for me, a war I shall launch against them. I realize that this will be my true destiny.US ENEMYWashington viewed him as a potential enemy even before his rebel army forced Batista to flee Cuba on New Years Day, 1959.It took just two years for the relationship to unravel as Castro nationalized swathes of the economy and introduced a broad agrarian reform. Thousands escaped the island, starting what became a bitter bulwark of opposition in Florida.In in this Feb. 6, 1959 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro speaks to a crowd during his triumphant march to Havana after the fall of the Batista regime. (AP Photo/File) In in this Feb. 6, 1959 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro speaks to a crowd during his triumphant march to Havana after the fall of the Batista regime. (AP Photo/File)In April 1961, when his military crushed a CIA-backed invasion by Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs, he declared Cuba socialist and allied himself with the Soviet Union.Moscow put nuclear missiles on the island in 1962, touching off a 13-day superpower showdown known as the Cuban missile crisis.In an Oct. 26 cable to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Castro seemed convinced the Americans would invade Cuba and suggested the Soviets eliminate this danger with an act of legitimate self defense.Khrushchev felt Castro was advocating a pre-emptive nuclear strike and rejected it, telling him he was satisfied with US President John F. Kennedys pledge not to invade.The Soviets withdrew the missiles and Washington secretly agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey, ending the crisis.The United States imposed its trade embargo on Cuba in 1962 and the CIA admitted trying to kill Castro in the early years of his rule.Plots or plot ideas included trying to get Castro to smoke a poisoned cigar and taking advantage of his love of diving with an exploding seashell, or poisoning a diving suit.Castro reveled in his status as an elusive target.Im really happy to reach 80. I never expected it, not least having a neighbor  the greatest power in the world  trying to kill me every day, he said at a 2006 summit in Argentina, where crowds greeted him like a rock star.While the embargo was economically devastating, it allowed Castro to shift blame for chronic economic problems away from the system he built and onto the United States.He cast the fight as a David and Goliath story.Philip Bonsal, US ambassador to Cuba in 1959, later described Castro as a phenomenally gifted, erratic and unscrupulous autocrat who freed his country from American imperialism only to reduce it to a satellite of Moscow.REVOLUTIONIn a country that was prosperous by Latin American standards but riven by inequality and illiteracy and with an unsavory reputation as a brothel and gambling-rich playground for Americans, Castro sought to build a socialist society.His government trained thousands of doctors and provided free schooling, changes that have endured well into the 21st century, even as the states role in the economy was reduced in recent years.Those gains came at considerable cost to personal freedoms. Dissent was stifled in a one-party state with no free press, and the states long arm reached deep into Cuban lives.Throughout, Castro was a mentor to left-wing leaders and a friend to intellectuals such as Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, although others abandoned him in horror.He helped Marxist guerrillas and revolutionary governments around the world, sending troops to Angola in the 1970s to support a left-wing government over the initial objections of Moscow.Cuba helped defeat South African insurgents in Angola and win Namibias independence from South Africa in 1990, adding pressure on the apartheid regime.After Nelson Mandela was freed from prison in 1990, he repeatedly thanked Castro. The Cuban leader was also a hero to Sandinista rebels who took power in Nicaragua in 1979.COMMUNIST OUTPOSTAfter the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1991, it seemed Castros communist rule would not survive.Cubans endured prolonged power cuts and shortages of food and basics such as soap. Ever stubborn, Castro implored them to endure the special period for the sake of the revolution.He undertook some reforms, allowing foreign investment and mass tourism from Canada and Europe, and tapping exile dollars by allowing Cubans more contact with their relatives abroad.He also let the most disgruntled leave in a chaotic exodus of makeshift boats that forced US President Bill Clinton to agree to more orderly migration.Castro was quick to see a potential ally in late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and courted him well before he won power. When Chavez took office in 1998, Castro had a new source of cheap oil, providing a huge boost to Cubas economy.Little was known about Castros personal life but even among his critics, few accused him of using power for personal gain. His tastes tended toward the ascetic.He lived in a compound in western Havana and had nine children with five women including five sons with his common-law wife Dalia Soto del Valle, who lived with Castro at the end.His eldest son Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart is a Soviet-trained nuclear scientist from the Cuban leaders only acknowledged marriage. Daughter Alina Fernandez, whose mother was a Havana socialite who Castro had an affair with while underground in the 1950s, escaped from Cuba disguised as a tourist in 1993 and is a vocal critic of her father.In one of two documentaries about him, US director Oliver Stone suggested to Castro that he was a caudillo, or Latin American strongman.Castro, who always prickled at suggestions of cruelty, rejected the term. I am a kind of spiritual leader, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Dissent was stifled in a one-party state with no free press, and the state's long arm reached deep into Cuban lives.Throughout, Castro was a mentor to left-wing leaders and a friend to intellectuals such as Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, although others abandoned him in horror.He helped Marxist guerrillas and revolutionary governments around the world, sending troops to Angola in the 1970s to support a left-wing government over the initial objections of Moscow.Cuba helped defeat South African insurgents in Angola and win Namibia's independence from South Africa in 1990, adding pressure on the apartheid regime.After Nelson Mandela was freed from prison in 1990, he repeatedly thanked Castro. The Cuban leader was also a hero to Sandinista rebels who took power in Nicaragua in 1979.After the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1991, it seemed Castro's communist rule would not survive.Cubans endured prolonged power cuts and shortages of food and basics such as soap. Ever stubborn, Castro implored them to endure the ""special period"" for the sake of the revolution.He undertook some reforms, allowing foreign investment and mass tourism from Canada and Europe, and tapping exile dollars by allowing Cubans more contact with their relatives abroad.He also let the most disgruntled leave in a chaotic exodus of makeshift boats that forced US President Bill Clinton to agree to more orderly migration.Castro was quick to see a potential ally in late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and courted him well before he won power. When Chavez took office in 1998, Castro had a new source of cheap oil, providing a huge boost to Cuba's economy.Little was known about Castro's personal life but even among his critics, few accused him of using power for personal gain. His tastes tended toward the ascetic.He lived in a compound in western Havana and had nine children with five women including five sons with his common-law wife Dalia Soto del Valle, who lived with Castro at the end.His eldest son Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart is a Soviet-trained nuclear scientist from the Cuban leader's only acknowledged marriage. Daughter Alina Fernandez, whose mother was a Havana socialite who Castro had an affair with while underground in the 1950s, escaped from Cuba disguised as a tourist in 1993 and is a vocal critic of her father.In one of two documentaries about him, US director Oliver Stone suggested to Castro that he was a ""caudillo,"" or Latin American strongman.Castro, who always prickled at suggestions of cruelty, rejected the term. ""I am a kind of spiritual leader,"" he said."
296,Deepak Gola ki shaadi: weddings must now factor in ‘black money’,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/weddings-must-now-factor-in-black-money-4397129/,2016-11-27,Indian Express,"Across Chandni Chowk, the one-stop shop for all things matrimonial, The Sunday Express joins a 22-year-old as he sets off with a little band, a little baaja and a little baraat. Photographs: Tashi TobgyalMy name is Love, but I dont believe in love; ours is an arranged marriage, says Deepak aka Love Gola. At 5 pm, with only five hours to go for his wedding, Deepak is sitting slumped on the floor, dressed in a pair of checked boxers and a half-sleeved vest and leaning heavily on his mother Amita. The 22-year-old gym instructor and his extended family have congregated at Jattumal Dharamshala, at the far end of Sitaram Gali in Old Delhis Chandni Chowk, from where the baraat will set off this evening. I had big plans for my wedding. I wanted to go to the parlour to get dressed but all I could afford was a hair cut, says Deepak, running his fingers through his hair thats streaked blond.The baraat sets off The baraat sets offDeepak, the youngest of four siblings, had got engaged to Priya Prajapati, a 22-year-old from Nand Nagri in East Delhi, in April, six months before the Central governments sudden decision to scrap notes of Rs 500 and 1,000. The decision scuttled his dreams of a grand wedding and what followed was an endless spiral of cost cuts. Demonetisation ne sab pe paani pher diya (Demonetisation played the spoiler), he complains.Deepaks 53-year-old mother Amita, her face taut, is concentrating on the mehndi her niece is drawing on her outstretched palms. Deepaks sister Bhavna, 32, is lying on one of the three mattresses spread out on the floor, trying to put her three-year-old son to sleep. The few others in the dharamshala, a few cousins and friends of the Golas, are idly waiting for the ceremonies to begin.Since November 8, we have only been queuing up outside banks  I, my son, daughter, niece Sirf dimag mein tension hi tension hai (I have been very tense), says Amita, whose husband Roopchand, a property dealer, died four years ago. Amita gets nostalgic as she talks about their wedding in 1978, incidentally the year of the last demonetisation exercise. Of course, then I didnt know any better. Or at least I dont remember going through such trouble, she says.His nephew has woken up in time for the wedding His nephew has woken up in time for the weddingWe had saved up Rs 2 lakh for the wedding. We queued up to exchange some money but the first three days, by the time our turn came, the money at the bank would get over. We finally managed to deposit all the money after 10 days, and then began queuing up to withdraw it, says Deepak, stretching out his mehndi-painted feet. The family could eventually only withdraw Rs 58,000, the budget hence for Deepaks November 23 wedding.The government has set a withdrawal limit of Rs 2.5 lakh for weddings, with stringent conditions  claimants have to produce wedding cards and copies of advance payments made. Besides, withdrawals are allowed only from balance available before November 8. We didnt even try. We werent sure if we were eligible and there was no time anyway, says Deepak.Indu, 24, the third of Amitas four children, says, If this (the demonetisation) hadnt happened, bhaiyya ki baraat would have set off from a banquet hall, not from a dharamshala. The siblings exchange a quick smile. They had hired a banquet hall but cancelled it for the dharamshala close to their home.A few paces from the dharamshala, the forced austerity at the Gola household finds its echoes in the markets of Chandni Chowk, the Capitals hub for all things matrimonial.Band budget: Rs 12,000Rahul Band had not been paid any money till wedding day by the Golas. The band members are all from Mahua in UP Band budget: Rs 12,000Rahul Band had not been paid any money till wedding day by the Golas. The band members are all from Mahua in UPAt the office of Jea Band, one of the oldest wedding organisers in Old Delhi, Anil Thadani, 45, is busy handling the mood swings of his clients. All our clients are panicking Most of them come to us with old notes, phir gussa dikhatein hain, koi emotional ho jata hai (Some clients get angry, some turn emotional). But we have no option, we have strictly stopped accepting old notes, says Thadani. The company, which featured in the 2001 movie Monsoon Wedding, organises venues, tents, bands and decorations for weddings.There are 150 auspicious wedding days in a year and business is usually brisk then. But this year, 25 per cent of our bookings have been cancelled, many have been postponed, and 15 per cent is on credit. We have been forced to lay off some of our staff, says Thadani, stopping to admonish someone on the phone: Pooja shuru hone waali hai, ghodi nahi pahunchi (The puja is about to begin, where is the horse)!A lot of families are also opting for day weddings to cut lighting costs, he says, though adding that while the move has hit the industry, in the long run, it will make the sector more organised.***At the dharamshala, Amita is still disgruntled. Unmindful of the caked mehndi on her palms, she angrily pulls out a cloth bag full of Rs 100 and Rs 50 notes and says, This is all the money we have! We cancelled the reception and the sangeet. All the other ceremonies  haldi, mehndi and the wedding  are being done in one day. Ladki waalon ne kuch dahej bhi nahin diya. Unka cash bhi humne hi line mein lag kar exchange karwaya (The girls family didnt give dowry either; it was we who got even their old notes exchanged), she says. We didnt buy new clothes for ourselves or gifts for our guests. I am wearing a sari my mother gifted me. The only thing we bought was a suit for Love, she says, pointing to a beige-and-maroon sherwani hanging from a nail on one of the pillars.Clothes budget: only for groomGolas bought new clothes just for Deepak. At Chhabra store, they say lehenga sales are hit, no one is buying for relatives Clothes budget: only for groomGolas bought new clothes just for Deepak. At Chhabra store, they say lehenga sales are hit, no one is buying for relativesAt Chhabra Store, one of the most popular bridal wear shops in Chandni Chowk, Manoj Kumar, 44, a salesman, says many families have, like the Golas, cut down on their trousseau budget in the wake of the new policy. Lehenga sales have been hit. No one is buying lehengas for more than Rs 15,000-20,000, says Kumar. Bride toh lehenga kharidegi hi, par relatives ke liye ab koi kapde nahin khareed raha (The bride will of course buy the lehenga, but no one is buying clothes for relatives), he says, folding a bright red sari.Kunal Singh Chhabra, 18, the store owners son who is overseeing operations at the shop today, says sales have gone down by 80 per cent. The first three days after November 8 saw zero business. Even now, the ones who come to us insist on giving us old notes. So we take the money from them and send our boys to queue up outside banks, says Chhabra, who is an undergraduate student in Mumbai and is in the Capital on a break.However, he backs the demonetisation move. I want to become a politician when I grow up. So I think it is brilliant.All along Katra Asharfi, the lane in Chandni Chowk that has over 200 bridal-wear shops, including Chhabra Store, most are empty, with desperate salesmen calling out to people on the road. Across the street, there are lines but outside banks and ATMs.Chhabra, however, is hopeful. Have you seen the movie Band Baaja Baaraat? The actors in the movie say no matter what, weddings will happen. That is absolutely true. Just give it some time, says the budding businessman.A little more than a kilometre away is Dariba Kalan, the Mughal-era bazaar for silver jewellery. There have been no customers since morning. We have lost 70 per cent of our business. The artisans are suffering, they are not accepting cheques, complains Vineet Seth, 48, who owns Durgadas Seth Jewellers and Silversmiths. He is also anxious about the rumours that have been doing the rounds. People are very scared. Look around, most shops are shut. We have been receiving messages on WhatsApp about possible raids by the Income Tax Department, says Seth, who is also the general secretary of the Dariba Jewellers Association.Apart from the silver stock thats piling up in his shop  jewellery, bowls and cups  Seth is worried about his top-selling gift item, silver boxes with framed notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. No one wants them now. I have to get these notes replaced. Now, people are only buying silver coins worth Rs 250, he says.Seth is not completely convinced about the demonetisation, rattling off a few idioms to express his state of mind: We have entered a tunnel, lets see if there is light at the end of it Dekhein oont kis karwat baithta hai (Lets see how it goes), he says.A kilometre away is Kinari Bazar, the one-stop shop for wedding bling  shimmery laces, envelopes, turbans for grooms and chooda-kaleere (bangles) for the bride. Modi ji ne bahut accha kiya, sabko barbaad kar diya (PM Modi did a very good thing, he killed our business)! says Piyush Gupta, 30, who owns a shop in the market. Business has gone down by 50 per cent. People are opting for court marriages, no one wants turbans and bangles anymore. We sell items worth Rs 10, 20 and 50. But the few people who come to us come with Rs 2,000 and we turn them away, he says.***Utensil budget: 0R K Sharma, who rents out utensils, says weddings like of the Golas are happening in dharamshalas, which provide vessels Utensil budget: 0R K Sharma, who rents out utensils, says weddings like of the Golas are happening in dharamshalas, which provide vesselsShaadi ka mazaa hi nahin hain (the wedding fervour is missing), says Deepaks sister Bhavna. Around her, everything is moving at an unhurried pace, with little to suggest that Deepak will take his wedding vows in a few hours from now. There is no decoration  no marigold flowers or electrical streamers  no trays of food going around, no piled-up gifts.The family had got the wedding invitations printed before the notes were scrapped, but not everyone who received the invitation is here. Though I sent invitations to my four sisters, eventually, I asked only two of them to come. The other two have big families. Where would they have stayed? Now they wont invite me for their childrens weddings, worries Amita, hurriedly collecting her belongings to get dressed at a neighbours home. Beauty parlour bhi nahi gaye, khud hi taiyaar ho rahe hain (We are not going to the salon either), says Bhavna.Ram Veer, 23, a mehndi artiste from Aligarh who visits Delhi during the wedding season every year, says its been an exceptionally bad season for him too. We charge Rs 50 for designs per hand, but that hardly gets us any money. We usually make all our money from bridal mehndi  Rs 1,500 for both hands and feet. Earlier, we would be booked for the entire season, but this year, there are no customers, only cancellations, says Ram Veer, sitting on a stool outside a beauty salon at Sitaram Gali.Unlike the Golas, many families have also cancelled their orders for wedding cards. We have stacks and stacks of printed invitations but customers havent been collecting them. All the customers just disappeared. Sab thap ho gaya hai (Business has shut completely), says C P Singh, 42, owner of Maharaja Papers and Cards in Chawri Bazar, the Capitals biggest market for invitation cards. I have been sitting here for hours People say demonetisation is a good move, but I dont know, it all seems uncertain now, he says, looking out at the empty street.As the sun begins to set, there is some sign of activity at the Jattumal Dharamshala. Two workers from Radhe Radhe Snacks and Caterers, an 80-year-old shop in Chandni Chowks Sitaram Gali, have arrived. The menu is basic: samosa and chai. For its owner Pradeep Sharma, 45, that is a severe downgrade. Usually, there are 250-odd items on the menu during the wedding season. Kashmiri aloo, shahi paneer, kadai paneer, tawa sabzi they are all off the menu now. Clients are only asking for potato dishes. Four of my orders have been cancelled. At the Gola wedding too, we are only making snacks, he says.Dhol budget: Rs 6,000The dholwallahs, all from Solapur, are hopeful the family will pay them a good shagun. Lets see, they say Dhol budget: Rs 6,000The dholwallahs, all from Solapur, are hopeful the family will pay them a good shagun. Lets see, they sayThough the sudden note ban forced the Golas to trim their wedding expenses, Deepak had booked the band, dhol and photographers in advance. We had already given them some advance payment and they said if we cancelled, we wouldnt get the amount back. We still have to pay them some money. Right now, its all on credit, says Deepak, now slipping into his sherwani in the courtyard. His sister Bhavna and elder brother Sonu, 30, help him with the accessories. Indu has gone to a friends house to get her hair done.Outside, members of Rahul Band are getting impatient. Panch baje se aaye hain, pata nahin kab baraat niklegi (We have been here since 5 pm, dont know when the procession will leave), says band master Moolchand, dressed in a blue velvet outfit with yellow trimmings.Moolchand and his team of 11, all from Mahua village in Uttar Pradesh, come to the Capital only during the wedding season, and play bass drums, trombones, French horns, bugles, and sousaphones, set to tunes of old Bollywood songs. This time, however, Moolchand says, their trip has been wasted. This is our fifth wedding of the season, but we havent earned much. Some tell us to take cheques, but what will we do with that? says Moolchand, who has signed up for the Gola wedding for Rs 12,000. He has got no money so far.The dholwallahs, who have spread out in the courtyard now, are worried too. They are from Solapur in Maharashtra and, like members of the Rahul Band, make trips to Delhi during the wedding season. We are supposed to get Rs 6,000 for this wedding, lets see. Hopefully, they will enjoy the music and gives us good shagun (money), says Raja Chouhan, 23. We will stay back till March. If the income isnt good, we will return to Solapur.Dressed in a blue shirt, trousers, a red jacket and a red hat, Chouhan is keeping an eye on Rahul Band. We will have to make sure we lead the baraat. If we go first, before the bandwallahs, we will get to pick the money the guests throw, he says.***In the courtyard, Bhavna is giving final touches to the groom. A dupatta is tied around Deepaks waist, a turban placed on his head and a garland of Rs 10 notes put on him. Deepak turns emotional. Wiping away tears and hugging his siblings, he begins to head out. His mother and sister Indu still havent arrived.His best friend, also called Love (Anand), arrives with another garland of Rs 10 notes, interspersed with a few Rs 100 notes. Dost ke liye itna toh karna tha (I had to do this for my friend). It cost me Rs 1,500, he says, patting his friend on the back and posing for a photograph with the garland.Its dark now and the videographers flashbulb lights up the courtyard. For a little while, at least, the tension dissipates and Deepak tries to enjoy his big day. The revelry picks pace as the band begins playing the song Ye desh hai veer jawanon ka, and Deepak and his friends and relatives break into a dance. A few in the crowd pout for selfies and pose for photographer Vikas Kumar.Kumar and videographer Dharam Singh, from SR Studio, are happy to oblige everyone, though they admit being worried about their payments. They booked us for Rs 35,000 for three days. But now, that it is just a one-day function, I dont know Let them have a good time today, we will discuss money later, smiles Kumar, rushing to take the grooms photograph with his sister Indu, who has arrived in a dazzling green sari, matching eye-shadow, and crimped hair.After a few rituals, the group heads to the street outside, where Ajay Giri, 24, has been waiting with Rani, the mare which Deepak will soon mount. Rani is dressed for the occasion  a jasmine garland around her ears and a red, velvet cloth on her back. Giri and Rani have been booked for Rs 10,000, but all that money goes to his owner. The only money Giri makes is the shagun, usually in notes of Rs 100 and 500, or even 1,000 if he gets lucky. These days, he barely gets Rs 200 in all for a wedding. Earlier, Rani would do three weddings in one night; now one and some days, none. Here too, I am sure Rani will get gud (jaggery) and I will get nothing, he says.He is right. Bhavna feeds Rani some jaggery and Deepak climbs on to the mare with some help from his friends. Giri is forgotten.Finally, Deepak Golas baraat begins to take shape. The air is filled with beats of the band and dhol and the wedding procession dances with abandon. Neighbours look out, bodies bent over window sills and parapets of roofs. One of Deepaks uncles takes out a bundle of Rs 10 notes and flings it on the groom. As the band and dholwallahs rush to grab the notes, the uncle quickly collects the notes and stuffs them in his jacket. Disappointed, the band and dholwallahs return to their spots and switch to a new track, Aaj mere yaar ki shadi hai. Happy with the new song, another relative tosses some money in the air and this time, band master Moolchand alerts his team members in time. Two of them rush and get the money.The procession begins, making its way past homes and shops, many of which have signboards of Yahan udhaar mana hai (No credit here) placed outside. The procession holds up traffic on the narrow lanes of Chandni Chowk.A few metres away from New Delhi Railway Station, the band, dhol and ghodi are relieved and members of the baraat accommodate themselves into a few cars, some of their friends and relatives, the others hired. They are off to Nand Nagri in East Delhi, where Deepaks bride is waiting for them.Ladki waalon ne sirf pachas logon ka khana rakhwaya hai. Kya kar sakte hain, choti shadi hi hogi (The girls side has arranged for food for 50 people only. What can we do, it will be a small wedding), smiles Amita, squeezed into the rear seat of a car.Wedding budget: Rs 58,000Deepak with his bride Priya. I couldnt enjoy the wedding fully because of the cash crunch, but I am happy, he says Wedding budget: Rs 58,000Deepak with his bride Priya. I couldnt enjoy the wedding fully because of the cash crunch, but I am happy, he says***Two days after the wedding, as Deepak Gola settles into his new life, he has mixed feelings about his wedding. Enjoyment nahin hui poori paison ke wajah se (Couldnt enjoy the wedding completely because of the cash crunch). But I am happy, lifetime ki commitment hai, he says.A wedding plannerNov 8Government scraps notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominationNov 16Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das says a member of the family can make a one-time withdrawal of Rs 2.5 lakh for a weddingNov 21RBI issues new rules, says wedding card, copies of advance payments made for booking marriage hall and caterers will be required for withdrawing Rs 2.5 lakh.

297,Panel to review potato loss,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2016/nov/27/panel-to-review-potato-loss-1543089.html,2016-11-27,The New Indian Express,"BHUBANESWAR: The Steering Committee on Potato Buffer Stock Scheme has ordered that the loss incurred in procurement of the tuber by Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation (OSCSC) will be reviewed by a panel.The panel, headed by an Additional Secretary-ranked officer of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department, will ascertain the genuineness of the loss incurred by the State agency.In view of the potato crisis in 2014, the Government had launched the scheme for augmenting procurement and production in the State.The steering committee had also decided to form another panel which will assess the actual coverage of potato cultivation and anticipated production in Odisha as well as in West Bengal so that procurement can be planned well in advance. Director, Horticulture will head the panel which will submit its report by December-end. Basing on the report, the State Government will go in for potato procurement.Two agencies, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) and Odisha State Cooperative Marketing Federation (MARKFED) which have been identified for procuring the tuber for 2017, have also been asked to submit details of a cost estimate of the crop. Payments to the procuring agencies will be made only after delivery of potato."
298,"Food prices steady, but is there a secret behind that?",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2016/nov/28/food-prices-steady-but-is-there-a-secret-behind-that-1543360.html,2016-11-28,The New Indian Express,"More than two weeks after confiscatory demonetisation sucked cash out from the economy, the food market has remained by and large steady, rather deceptively so. This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

For those involved in agriculture in West Bengal  estimated to be two-thirds of the states 91 million population  the question and its potential answers have dire consequences.While the average area owned by each household in Bengal is 0.174 hectares  the smallest in any state of India  officials said the sheer fertility of land in the Bengal delta meant that many, particularly marginal landowners, cultivated their land to supplement their income. Take for instance the case of Dharani Kanta Bhowmik (55), a schoolmaster who died on Tuesday in Cooch Behar after standing in queue for three consecutive days. Bhowmik owned less than 0.1 hectares and like many others in Cooch Behar, cultivated paddy. He had been trying to withdraw money to pay labourers who worked on his land.WATCH VIDEO: Heres Why RBI Restricted Withdrawal Limits On Jan Dhan Accounts To Rs 10,000On Thursday, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das announced that farmers would be allowed to withdraw up to Rs 25,000 per week against crop loans, subjected to limits. This would also apply to those who hold Kisan credit cards. Bank accounts needed to be in the name of the concerned farmers.On the other hand, traders with Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets, would be able to draw of Rs 50,000 per week to pay wages and other sundry expenses.Almost 1,500 km away, at Boinchi in Hooghly, small-time trader Bibhash Sen who also grows potatoes on his land, is confused. I have three katha of land (0.1 hectares) on which I grow paddy. But I dont have a kisan credit card. Does that mean I would not be able to avail this relaxation? I went to the cooperative bank, but no one knew. I will go again on Monday. I desperately need money to buy seeds and begin planting.As of June 2016, only 31 per cent of the 17 lakh targetted Kisan credit card accounts had been opened, said State Level Bankers Committee records.Moreover, as per government records, Bengal only has 2,918 APMC markets and agriculture  in spite of the state being food surplus  remains largely informal. But unlike other food surplus states, small and marginal farmers contribute almost 86 per cent of the total output in Bengal. But the inherent informality of the agricultural system implies that these small and marginal farmers continue to be deeply in debt, with an estimated 88.7 per cent of all indebted ones owning land less than 1 hectare.WATCH VIDEO: Income Tax Law To Be Changed To Increase Penalty On Unexplained Deposits: All You Need To KnowOn the ground, farmers  many of whom are already in debt  are now finding that the traditional network of moneylenders do not exist anymore, following the governments decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.Prabir Sengupta, a small-time farmer in Howrahs Andul area, said: The demonetisation move has spelt disaster for me. As a BJP supporter, I had initially welcomed the move. But it is obvious that the government didnt think this through and take into account how agricultural practices are in different across the country.Claiming that wholesalers had refused to buy his potato crop citing inability to pay in cash, he added: I have a debt of almost Rs 7 lakh and will have to take more loans to pay for labour and fertiliser.

Be it buying groceries or objects of desire, there is a unique pleasure in visiting shops. For women, shopping gives them relief from the mental tension associated with daily chores. But I beg to differ.Though I often accompany my other half to the supermarket and jewellery shop, I feel out of place once I step in to the shops. At the supermarket, my job is to stand behind her and push the shopping cart while she leisurely picks up packets of foreign cheese and honey marketed by Patanjali.Though we returned from another country a few years ago after spending nearly quarter of a century there, the shopping pattern has not changed much. Extra virgin olive oil made in Spain, Anchor cheese and American apples! If my better half wants to spend more than five minutes in selecting an item, I happily tell her, Take your own time. Give me a missed call when you finish selecting your objects of desire.This is the time for me to roam around the supermarket. I go to the vegetable section and read the price of a kilogramme of potato and onion only to forget it within minutes. After that I go to the organic food section. Till date I have not found more than two customers buying from this counter. Then, I take a glass of payasam offered free of cost by the young girl who is there to promote the item.I say hello to the girl standing outside the perfume shop with a bottle of a new scent that she is desperately trying to sell. After spending more than 30 minutes at various sections in the supermarket without buying anything, I usually get the missed call from my wife. She would be near the cash counter with her shopping cart fully loaded. I once again check my wallet to confirm that there is enough cash.I pay the money to the cashier and push the cart all the way to the car. Accompanying my life partner to the jewellery shop is not pleasant either. When I enter the shop I feel trapped. When you go to a barber shop, there are magazines to read while you wait for your turn. If it is a dental clinic, there are old issues of popular magazines and other promotional materials from pharmaceutical companies.But in jewellery shops, I have never found any reading material for the customers. My problem: How to spend time while my partner shops for a gold chain? When I try to go for a coffee at a nearby shop, she tells: Wait, only ten minutes more. I still accompany my wife for shopping and pay all the bills as I have for many years. Life is like that."

The distribution drive, planned outside the UP Legislative Assembly building, is aimed at drawing the government's attention to the acute problems being faced by farmers across the country, exacerbated by the government demonetisation move which had led to a liquidity crunch.Speaking to TOI, BKU's Lucknow spokesperson Alok Verma said, ""Farmers have not been able to sell their potato and paddy produce and the markets are lying empty . To make ends meet, a large number of them were forced to make distress sale of paddy at Rs 600 to Rs 800 per quintal even though the minimum support price declared by the government is Rs 1,470 per quintal. Now, demonetisation had crippled business further because farmers have no money to buy seeds, DAP , and fertilisers to sow the rabi (winter) crop. They are dumping their produce in the state capital in the hope that the government will take note and do something for them.""Until Tuesday night, 22 trucks-full of paddy and potaoes had landed up outside the BKU office in Lucknow. Verma claimed that potatoes and paddy in excess of 100 quintals will be up for grabs outside Vidhan Sabha. ""Our distress is not a joke.Farmers have given their sweat and blood for this produce and they are getting no buyers. We have to feed our families too.And the government is turning a blind eye to the country's ""annadaata"","" Verma added."

By November 25, 55% of paddy is harvested, but only 22% Kharif paddy has been reaped so far. The government is thinking of diverting 100-day job labourers to fields for reaping the crop.Bengal's food minister Jyotipriya Mullick on Tuesday said: "" After the paddy is procured, it will go to rice mills . Each entry at rice mill will generate three challans, one of which comes straight to food department in Kolkata. Immediately , the fund will be transferred to the bank account of the farmer through RTGS system. The entire procure ment will be monitored at multiple levels so no corruption creeps in.""He added: ""We have Rs 5,000 crore with the department for procurement. Moreover, we are taking a loan of Rs 1,000 crore from the West Bengal Finance Development Corporation. Besides, the Centre is supposed to give us Rs 2,008 crore this year and Rs 481 crore against last year's due.The state has set the minimum support price of Rs 1,490 per quintal (.1 tonne). It has also set a procurement target of 52 lakh tonne paddy which will yield 41.20 lakh tonne rice. The state's requirement out of the procurement is 32 lakh tonne. Six lakh tonne of rice will be sold to Jharkhand. Rest of the rice will be given to state food safety pool and central food safety pool.The food minister also alerted against a fake job racket in the name of paddy procurement. The racket is playing havoc with the youths in rural Bengal. They are duping job-seekers and charging thousands of rupees in the name of recruitment of civic volunteers by the food department. ""We cannot recruit civic volunteers. Civic volunteers are there with the police department. In case of procurement, the civic volunteers will be roped in from the respective superintendent of police of the district. They floated fake websites and I have ordered inquiry by CID,"" said Mullick.Potato clearance deadline extendedThe Bengal government has extended the deadline for clearing potato stock from cold storage by eight more days.Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta on Tuesday said, ""We have asked all the stakeholders in the potato business to clear the stock immediately. The government will not allow any off-take of potato after December 8. There is 8 lakh tonne of potato stock lying in 480 cold storages in Bengal."
303,Watch out for these four crops!,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-currency-ban-agricultural-producuction-wholesale-market-4404175/,2016-12-01,Indian Express,"There are four major crops currently being planted or in the early stages of growth  wheat, onion, potato and chana (chickpea)  whose status needs close monitoring in the coming weeks, to ensure least production disruptions from demonetisation-imposed cash crunch.In three of the four commodities, tight supplies have already led to price rise. Wheat is now retailing in Delhi at Rs 24 per kg, up from Rs 19 at this time last year. This, even as stocks in government warehouses have depleted to a 9-year-low. Retail prices of milled chana dal and potato are, likewise, averaging Rs 140 and Rs 20 per kg, respectively, as against their corresponding levels of Rs 70 and Rs 12 a year ago. Consumers are paying about Rs 15/kg for onions  half of what they were last year at this point  but low plantings this rabi season can be a source of worry over the next 4-5 months.WATCH VIDEO: Petrol Pumps, Air Ticket Counters Will Not Accept Old Rs 500 Notes After December 2Thankfully, data from the agriculture ministry shows area sown under both wheat and chana so far in the ongoing rabi season to be higher than the progressive coverage during the same period last year. Available indications are that there will be no shortfall in planted acreages for three reasons. The first is the improved soil and sub-soil moisture levels. Second, high prices are themselves an incentive for farmers to plant. In the case of wheat, the Rs 100 increase in MSP to Rs 1,625 per quintal is an added motivation. Third, both wheat and chana are non-hybrid crops, whose grain saved from the previous years crop can be used as seed for the current season. Most farmers would, therefore, not be buying seed. Lack of cash shouldnt in any case be a deterrent for sowing.Cash can, however, be an issue when it comes to purchase of other inputs like fertiliser, pesticide and labour. Farmers need to give three 50-kg bags of urea and one bag of di-ammonium phosphate for every acre of wheat. In potato, the requirement is even more: 3 bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and muriate of potash. The cost of these works out to Rs 2,000-3,300 per acre. While there is no dearth of availability of fertilisers, whether farmers have the cash to purchase these isnt clear. Also, the application has to be timely  farmers, for instance, need to give one bag of urea per acre 20-25 days after sowing. With cooperative banks not being allowed to accept the old notes, there is also a question mark on availability of sufficient credit for farmers in the current rabi season.Farmers also need cash to pay labour, whose requirement is particularly high in onions and potatoes. In potato, the sowing operations were completed in Punjab by end-September, and by end-October in Uttar Pradesh. Right now, planting operations are taking place mainly in West Bengal and Bihar, and there are reports of farmers struggling to raise cash to pay labour.The next few months will decide the fate of these four crops and also sugar, where, too, supply situation is tight though that precedes monetisation. Preventing a flare-up in prices before Assembly elections in UP and Punjab would pose a huge challenge to the government at the Centre.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
304,Demonetisation impacts India’s border trade with Bhutan,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-impacts-Indias-border-trade-with-Bhutan/articleshow/55718532.cms,2016-12-01,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: The November 8 demonitisation initiative has adversely impacted India's border trade with Bhutan, Delhi's closest neighbour in South Asia.Farmers and exporters in Bhutan's Phuentsholing town bordering India has been hit following the currency ban. The move has led to cardamom and potato sales from Bhutan to India dropping drastically as Indian traders have been struggling to arrange cash for making payments, informed persons familiar with the developments. Indian currency is used as legal tender in Nepal and Bhutan. Phuentsholing is the main land border entry point between India and Bhutan.Sufficient cash is not available for the export-oriented businesses in Phuentsholing market, according to the persons familiar with Indo-Bhutan border trade. Bhutanese traders ruethey get to withdraw only Rs 2,500 from ATMs in a day which is not enough. Most of the transactions are cash based.The price of cardamom mid-November hit a record low of 700 Ngultrum per kg, which was between 800 and 900 Ngultrum a week ago. Ngultrum is the currency of Bhutan. One Bhutanese Ngultrum equals One Indian Rupee Indian traders have informed their Bhutanese counterparts they would be able to import agro-products only after three months. Some Bhutanese traders have not been able to export any cardamom since November 8. Cardamom export has drastically gone down in Silliguri, which is a major market for Bhutan. If the trend continues the cardamom price will decline further and there is risk that exports from Bhutan will get further affected, according to informed sources.Similarly potato exports from Bhutan to India have also slowed down. Some Indian exporters also paid their Bhutanese counterparts in old currencies. India is Bhutan's largest trading partner. A free trade regime exists between India and Bhutan. Major items of exports from Bhutan to India are electricity, ferro-alloys, carbides, bar and rods, cement, copper wire, semi finished products of iron and non-alloy steel, Dolomite, gypsum, agri products such as oranges, cardamom and potatoes.Meanwhile, Bhutan's mineral exports to Bangladesh has also been affected. While Letter of Credits are being used for payments, transportation has been proving a challenge.Trucks from Phuentsholing and Samdrupjongkhar, on the border with Assam , take minerals until Burimari, border area between India and Bangladesh. Indian currency is required for logisticssupport in this trade which is currently not available in the market.Bhutan has been taking up the issue of currency ban with India ever since the PM's announcement on demonitisation as the Himalayan State is also being faced with the crisis of cash crunch. Nepal and Bhutan, two major recipients of Indian financial aid, have taken up with New Delhi the issue of demonetisation of high-value currency bills and the impact it could have on financial assistance to them. India has earmarked Rs5,490 crore for Bhutan and Rs300 crore for Nepal in this year's budget The Bhutanese Central Bank has informed all banks in the country to freeze, until further notice, withdrawals of Ngultrums in exchange for demonetised INR notes of 500 and 1,000 denomination by Bhutanese individuals and companies."

Potato growers say there are no buyers and that they are yet to receive full payments even for the stocks they have already supplied to other states before and after the demonetisation.Also, they say, the government announcement allowing farmers to purchase seed with old currency notes came quite late when the potato sowing season in other states was almost about to end.In Punjab, potato planting season is from September-end till early October while in other states, it is between October 25 and November 25.In every cold store, around 10,000 to 12,000 bags of 50 kg each have been lying. Now, we do not know where to go and what to do, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. I have got 22,000 packets of government certified seed in my own cold store but there is no taker.Sangha said Punjab farmers were selling potato seeds at Rs 30-35/kg to the traders from other states before the announcement of the demonetisation on November 8, but after that, buyers simply vanished.The government has put us in a big trouble and it should compensate us now, said Sangha.Now we are planning to throw this potato seed either on roads or to distribute it to the poor as there is no taker. We cannot afford to keep these in cold stores where we have to pay rent and also for next crop which will start coming in February we have to empty our stores, said Raghbir Singh, the president of JPGA.Meanwhile, the rate of table potato has been hovering between Rs 800 and 1000 per quintal in wholesale market.Punjabs potato farmers are the main seed supplier of the crop across the country. The state produces about 2.2 metric tonnes, out of which 1.5 MT comprises seed potatoes only. Currently, Punjab supplies about 1.1 MT of potato seed to other states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other potato producing state and meets around 63 per cent of the seed demand of the country every year.Doaba region, where potato seed is grown on 90,000 hectares of area, is the home of potato seed for the entire country. Jalandhar too has big potato producers.The sowing takes place in early-October and harvesting towards February-March, after which the produce is put in cold stores. Yields of seed potatoes, at 8-10 tonnes per acre, are below the 12-14 tonnes for normal table potatoes. But while the latter sell at Rs 1,000-1,200 per quintal, seed potatoes fetch rates that range from Rs 2,500-3,500 for branded and Rs 1,800-2,000 for unbranded material.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

In distant rural areas, local vegetable prices  both wholesale and retail  have crashed as the oxygen of currency has been suddenly sucked out. Since the whole economy depended on cash, from transport to mandis to purchase prices, this is unsurprising.But in cities, where there is more liquidity, vegetable arrivals in mandis have increased and wholesale prices have dropped but, surprise, retail prices have remained largely unaffected or are only slightly lower.An analysis of arrivals and prices data from 29 big cities from major states and Delhi shows that for a range of common vegetables, arrivals in mandis have actually gone up since November 8 when 500 and 1,000-rupee notes were rendered invalid. There has been an increase in arrivals of vegetables in many cities across India, including Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Patna and Guwahati.Wholesale traders in Delhi say this was driven by the fact that cash payments were still possible in bigger cities, unlike small rural markets. So, in the surrounding areas, there was a move to sell the produce in urban areas.As a result, barring okra (bhindi) and onions, the quantities of common vegetables like cauliflower, potato, tomato, cabbage, gourds, chillies, brinjal and peas reaching daily in wholesale markets of these cities increased by 10-30% between the week preceding November 8 and the fortnight following it. This should have led to falling vegetable prices for urban consumers. But that was not to be.Wholesale traders seem to have bargained with the desperate producers to push down wholesale or purchase prices substantially but did not pass on the full benefit to consumers. In all the big cities, data shows wholesale prices dipping in the post-demonetisation fortnight compared to the week before. In Delhi, for example, cauliflower, brinjal (round) and cabbage wholesale prices fell by over 50% each, peas and potatoes by about 40% and tomatoes by 13%.Onion prices increased by 14%, possibly because it is not as perishable as other vegetables and hence it was being held back. Okra prices increased by 23% for unknown reasons. But at the local sabziwallah, prices are at their usual levels, except for a downward trend in cauliflower, brinjal and cabbage  all dipping by over a third post-demonetisation.Onion prices have increased by 21%, reflecting the rise in wholesale prices. ""This is the rate we are getting at the mandi. The wholesalers are making money, not us,"" said Mangat Ram, a vegetable seller in East Delhi who claimed that his sales had dipped since November 8."

FILE PHOTO: C. VENKATACHALAPATHYC_VENKATACHALAPATHYPost-demonetisation, vegetable prices continue to slump in the Fort City.Traders say the situation has been worsening day by day, with business hit by at least 50 per cent since currency notes of 500 and 1,000 denomination were demonetised.A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, said both wholesale and retail vegetable dealers were facing losses since demonetisation of the two high value currencies. Vegetable markets are yet to bounce back from the effect, he said.The rates of vegetables have dipped by 5 to 6 per cent in the last few weeks. Business has gone down by nearly 50 per cent. At least half of the stock of vegetables is going waste with no takers. Many vendors have been forced to dump the vegetables as they perish quickly, he said.He added that people did not have money, and hence, the markets were dull with no business. Until a few days ago, we were accepting the old Rs. 500 notes from customers, while we were accepting the old Rs. 1,000 till last week. We have stopped accepting these notes as we do not have change to give in return, Mr. Balu added.The cost of tomatoes is Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 a kg while onions are priced between Rs. 8 and Rs. 15 (fresh onions) while the old onions are priced at Rs. 10 to Rs. 20. Small onions cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 while potatoes cost Rs. 20.The cost of other vegetables (per kilo): ladys finger  Rs. 12 to Rs. 15, drumstick  Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, brinjal  Rs. 15 to Rs. 30, cabbage  Rs. 10, carrot  Rs. 15, beans  Rs. 12, green chillies  Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, ginger  Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, broad beans  Rs. 20, bitter gourd  Rs. 12 to Rs. 15, snake gourd  Rs. 12, yam  Rs. 20, peas  Rs. 80, and coriander (a bunch)  Rs. 15."
312,Veggie wholesale prices crash,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Veggie-wholesale-prices-crash/articleshow/55847328.cms,2016-12-07,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: The wholesale price of vegetables has started dipping from Monday. However, there is little impact of on retail price. Thanks to the middlemen and the last man in the retail market, the price of vegetables remains quite high compared to their prices the same time last year. With the liquidity crunch continuing unabated, there is an element of distress sale at the source (from the field) by farmers. The overwhelming fear that the perishables may not be sold at all is also working behind the price crash.The potato (jyoti variety), which grows in abundance in Hooghly, is sold at Rs 4 per kg soon after its withdrawal from the cold storages. After sorting the potato, wholesale price stood at Rs 7-8 per kg. The retail price should have been Rs 910 per kg after taking into account the transportation and other costs. But the retail price remains as high as Rs 16-22 in most of the markets in the city. Thanks to demonetisation and the resultant liquidity crunch, a stockpile of 8 lakh tonnes of potatoes remained in the cold storages even after the deadline of clearing the stockpile expired on November 30. Bengal's agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said the potato price should come down after the potato stockpile is cleared. He has set a deadline of December 8 for clearing the entire stock from the cold storages.The price of brinjal, which grow mainly in Hooghly and Burdwan, crashed to Rs 55-60 per palla (per 5 kgs). The wholesale price should not be more than Rs 15 per kg. But brinjal price in the city retail market hovered around Rs 25-30 per kg.Cabbage, which was Rs 35-40 per palla in the wholesale market, is sold at Rs 20 per kg in the city retail markets.The biggest crash happened in tomato prices. Toma toes grow in huge quantity in Bankura and Purulia. The farmers on Tuesday sold it at Rs 20 a palla. The tomato wholesale price at Khatra and Manbazar stood at Rs 6 per kg. But the retail price of tomato remains as high as Rs 20-25 per kg on Tuesday.Uttam Kundu, a wholesaler at Seoraphuli wholesale market, said, ""We have asked farmers to raise Rs 1 per kg against every vegetable so that farmers get some price. But the fear of liquidity crunch is so high that people did distress sale. The market has become a bit unpredictable.""Agriculture marketing department sources said there is a collusion of middlemen and the last man in the market (last retail outlet) that prevented the plunge in retail price.Dasgupta said, ""We are not sitting idle. We have already carried out raids at several retail markets."""
313,Bridge adds to Manipur woes,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161208/jsp/northeast/story_123552.jsp,2016-12-08,Telegraph,"Imphal, Dec. 7: The deplorable condition of the Barak bridge along Imphal-Jiribam road on National Highway 37 has worsened Manipur's plight. The state has been facing an acute shortage of essential items since the United Naga Council (UNC) enforced an economic blockade on November 1. Now, the state's other lifeline is choked. The UNC has imposed an indefinite economic blockade to protest against the state government's move to carve out a separate Sadar Hills district from Senapati district and Jiribam district out of Imphal East. The blockade has cut off the state's lifeline - the Imphal-Dimapur road (National Highway 2). As a result, traffic has increased substantially along the Imphal-Jiribam road. But fears of an impending collapse of the Barak bridge led to only 220 loaded trucks (out of 693 lined up at Jiribam) leaving for Imphal this morning with security escorts. The 220 trucks include 43 trucks of petrol, 81 trucks loaded with diesel, 85 LPG bullets, 10 aviation turbine fuel carriers and one truck loaded with oxygen cylinders. The increased traffic has worsened the Barak bridge's condition. Transporters and the government had chosen NH 37 because it would be less affected by the blockade. Following the arrest of UNC president Gaidon Kamei and information secretary S.K. Stephen on November 25, the blockade has intensified. Essential commodities have become scarce and prices skyrocketed, with petrol reaching Rs 300 per litre and potatoes selling for Rs 50 per kg. The valley residents have responded with a counter- blockade. Movement of goods vehicles towards Naga-inhabited districts have been hampered. Yesterday, 209 vehicles stranded at Moreh were escorted safely to Imphal. The All Manipur Christian Organisation and Tribal Church Leader Forum today urged the United Committee Manipur to reconsider its ultimatum served to the UNC to lift the blockade within 72 hours, ending at midnight tonight. Christian leaders have urged the UNC to withdraw the blockade. Rev. Prim Vaiphei, president of the All Manipur Christian Organisation, said people had suffered enough for 37 days. He requested the UNC leaders to lift the blockade yesterday and they pointed out that the economic blockade was not against any particular community but against the state government. The All Manipur Muslim Welfare Organisation has also urged the UNC to end its blockade."

Acreage under traditional crops and vegetables is expected to go up this season due to favourable weather condition.Farmers have sown vegetables, including potato and garlic on 30,000 hectares in Indore district as against the target of 22,000 hectares.A top agriculture department official said, ""Sowing of winter crops in the district has almost been completed. Acreage under rabi crops are seen higher this year and most of the expansion is seen in the area under potato and garlic.""Industry experts said that better remuneration and timely arrival of winter this year have helped in expanding acreage under vegetables.The agriculture department official said, ""Last year farmers had earned profit in garlic and potato farming, which has resulted in expansion of acreage this year. Besides, winter arrived on expected date that boosted farming activities resulting in good yields."" Wheat and chana are the top traditional winter sown crops of the district. Madhya Pradesh is the top producer of chana, while it ranks fourth in terms of wheat production in the country.The target of rabi sowing in the district is 2.25 lakh hectares, which includes chana, wheat and vegetables.Another agriculture department official said, ""Sowing is progressing well and acreage for chana is seen higher this season as prices are very high and overall weather is favourable.""Last year, farmers had sown rabi crops under 2.22 lakh hectares in the district. As per the latest data of agriculture department, farmers have sown wheat on 1.17 lakh hectares, while chana has been sown on 75,000 hectares."
315,Gujarat farmers expect bumper potato crop,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Gujarat-farmers-expect-bumper-potato-crop/articleshow/55861666.cms,2016-12-08,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: Sowing of potato in the state is expected to cross 12 lakh hectares this year, as compared 10.70 lakh hectares last year, say agriculture experts. In 2015, potato sowing was conducted over 5.19 lakh hectares till December 5. This year, however, 10.17 lakh hectares have been sown by the same date. Consequently, a bumper potato crop is expected.Currently, Gujarat ranks fifth in the country in production of potato. Officials said potato production in the state has been rising steadily. While 23 lakh tonnes had come to the market in 2014, in 2015, that amount went up to 31 lakh tonnes, and to 35 lakh tonnes in 2016.Sowing of the crop picked up over last month, said officials, who reported that at least 5.51 lakh hectares had been sown in the last 20 days alone. If the trend continues, sowing will cross 12 lakh hectares - so far the highest area used to cultivate potato in Gujarat in any year.Mavjibhai Desai, chairman of the Deesa APMC attributes the exponential growth of potato farming to a number of reasons. ""This year, sowing has gone up with Narmada water reaching the northern parts of the state,"" said Desai, adding, ""The big increase in storage facilities has also drawn the attention of farmers to the cultivation of potato.""Desai said that in 2015-16 the top potato growing states - Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal - had seen their production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. However, unlike other potato-growing states, Gujarat had registered an increase in potato production due to higher acreage.Better prices have also attracted farmers to potato cultivation, hold officials in the agriculture department, who said farmers received a good price last year for their yields, and this year, as compared to 2015, potato seed is cheaper and more easily available.In 2015-16, cold storage capacity went up by 6.25 lakh tonnes, with the current capacity at 22.5 lakh tonnes, said agriculture department officials. Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda.Potatoes from Gujarat are sent to Maharashtra and states in South India, and are also exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Mauritius."
316,Veggie prices stay high as retailers make up for trade volume loss,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Veggie-prices-stay-high-as-retailers-make-up-for-trade-volume-loss/articleshow/55866163.cms,2016-12-08,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: Post-demonetisation, the cash-backed food supply chain has thrown up certain features that defy the demand-supply logic.The fall in demand in the retail market should have led to a drop in the prices of perishable commodities. But it did not, despite a drop in prices in the wholesale market. If the wholesale market price dip was due to less demand in the retail market despite adequate supply , this did not reflect in the retail prices. For example, prices of Chandramukhi potatos in Kolkata retail markets stand at Rs 20-22 a kilogram when the government deadline for taking potato out of the state cold storage was December 8. It held true for retail prices of winter vegetables as well, when they were supposed to dip a little during this time of the season. For example, a piece of cauliflower is priced between Rs 8 and Rs 10 a piece in the wholesale market, but the same vegetable is selling for Rs 20-Rs 22 in the retail market. Similarly , eggplants, which are available in abundance during winter, are priced at Rs 11 a kg in the wholesale market, while they cost Rs 22 per kilogram on the retail shelves.The contrast was contrary to the perception that the price of perishable goods would nosedive due to demonetisation. Though the rates did crash by almost 7580% post-demonetisation, they soon soared and remained consistent towards the higher range. ""The drive seems to have had only a marginal effect on the prices of vegetables in retail markets, where the rates have gone down by merely 5-10% after the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes,"" said Prabhat Kumar Das , organising sec retary of the Federation of Traders' Organisation and member of the chief minister's task force on price of edibles. This has surprised the state agriculture marketing department, whose minister Tapan Dasgupta, recently made the rounds of some markets to find out the reason for the constant rates. Even families, hoping for a respite albeit temporary , seemed disappointed with the veggie prices remaining high. ""I had hopes a slash in prices of edibles will be the only silver lining to the demonetisation drive but even that did not happen. The prices have stayed on the steep side,"" said Kakoli Dhar, a homemaker in Lake Town So what is the reason for the price mismatch between the wholesale and retail prices? State agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta blamed it on aggregators and retailers, trying to make up for loss in trade volume, by keeping the prices steep. ""Middlemen in the wholesale markets control the rates. A decrease in supply and increase in demand works in their favour. We are trying to weed out such elements so that the common man do not have to shell out more,"" said Dasgupta.The National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), under the finance ministry , did not rule out a price rise after an immediate slump due to demonetisation. The reason, it said, the producer at the first point of the supply chain might withdraw due to the liquidity crunch, leading to less sup ply , pushing prices up.Some traders alleged several unscrupulous elements were keeping the prices up by resorting to dishonest means. ""Within the first week, the prices dropped, but they did not dip further, though supply shrank,"" said the government's task force member. This despite several households shifting to malls and marts to buy edibles with plastic money .Salt Lake homemaker Reema Mukherjee earlier bought 25% of her groceries from the local market and rest from a convenience store. Now, she has shifted to a big store, using her debit card. ""It makes sense to use debit card now. Though I feel the supply in my local market is fresher and I can also bargain there, I am forced to go to the mart now,"" she said."

As wasted fruits and vegetables fill the area and raise a stink, estimates show that at least 60-70% of the produce is going waste because supply chain has been disrupted by cashlessness. It is the same situation at most mandis that come under Uttar Pradesh State Agricultural Produce Markets Board.On Wednesday morning, potato buyer and whole seller Mohammad Salim ordered throwing 25 sacks into the garbage dump. A single sack contains 1 quintal potatoes. ""An average of 20-25 sacks are going waste since demonetisation was announced,"" said the businessman.His son Mohammad Shaan said wastage over the month was to the tune of Rs 3.5 lakh. ""We would have sold the produce to retailers at an estimated rate of Rs 5 per kg which means Rs 12,500 for 25 quintals. If the average for 28 days of demonetization period is calculated, our loss stands at Rs 3.5 lakh,"" he said.But Salim is not the only one to have run into losses. The mandi comprises 50 buyers and at least 500 farmers in the vicinity. ""Cash and change crunch has upset business across levels. Over 60-70% of the produce is wasted for lack of demand. If this goes on, the mandi will have to close down,"" said Arvind Shukla, vice-president of the mandi's vegetable and fruit whole sellers association.General secretary Irshad Hussain added, ""Many farmers are not able to bring their produce to us because they have no money for transport. Some of the growers are dumping their produce either for peanuts at the local level or leaving it to fate. Even those who can manage are not able to get the cost of ferrying goods as prices have nose-dived.""Explaining the price factor, Saroj Pal, a dealer in tomatoes said, ""In October, a crate of tomatoes (25kg) sold at Rs 700 but a farmer gets only Rs 100 for the same now. Clearly, the rates have come down seven times.""Cauliflower, the cash crop of the past two seasons is making farmers regret. ""A single bud is fetching just 1 rupee instead of Rs 6-8 each last season,"" said Dharmu Lodhi, a farmer from Bangermau.Wastage at the fruit sellers' end was estimated to be around 40-50%. Tanveer Ahmed, who dealt with exotic fruits like kiwis , kinnows and grapes said, ""We dealt with these fruits on a daily basis but there have been just one or two business days in the week. The stock is going waste on a daily basis.""Tomato farmer from Rajpur (MP), Angad Singh said ""Will Modiji pay for our losses?"" Nizam Bhai pyazwale said, ""Many farmers had taken loans... the bid to battle black money is fine but not at the cost of human lives. Steps have to be taken immediately,"" he said.Hand-to-mouth locals are perhaps the only happy ones in the mandi because some vendors are giving away their vegetables free. Potato dealer Mohammad Irshad said, ""It will be disrespect of the Almighty if food is thrown away so it is better some human consumes some it without paying."" Beneficiary of this benevolence, Gita from Birdibagh said, ""I will use the best part for the family while feed the cattle on the rest."""
318,A month of demons: Try selling a bag of garlic in Modi’s cashless society,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2016/dec/09/a-month-of-demons-try-selling-a-bag-of-garlic-in-modis-cashless-society-1547152.html,2016-12-09,The New Indian Express,"BENGALURU: Every day, Ramani buys one bag of garlic at Bangalores Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market yard in Yeshwantpur and sells it in small quantities to small buyers. Its an investment of Rs 5000 for her, a senior citizen. She makes a small profit on it and she gets by on it.Once she has sold her bag, she goes back to the market to buy another and thus continues her cycle of existence. But things have changed for Ramani since Nov. 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modis government announced demonetization of high-value currency notes. It resulted in cash being sucked out of the market and buyers have become tight-fisted with the cash they have in hand.Ramani has been stuck with a bag of garlic she bought 25 days ago, for credit from a stockist. I used to sell a bag a day, she said when New Indian Express visited the market yard on Thursday, a month after demonetization kicked in.Her daughter Uma works in the same market as a daily wage worker. She used to make Rs 300 sifting onion at a stockyard. Work has been hard to find in the past one month. I have not been able to make Rs 100 a day. It is a very tough life for me right now, said Uma.The APMC market is said to be south Indias biggest agricultural market. Spread over 93 acres houses 1,980 wholesale shops that employ nearly 2,000 workers and trade in a mind-boggling variety of things Indians need every month: onions, garlic, potatoes, rice, atta, sugar, pulses, chillies, jaggery, coconuts, you name it.One month of demonetisation has left the bustling market wobbling, its business down 60 per cent from Rs 50 crore a day. Nearly 60 per cent of the business used to be done through cash.The markets assistant secretary, B N Krishnappa told New Indian Express, Theres just no cash around. Today (Thursday), our overall turnover was less than Rs 20 crore. We used to do Rs 50 crore.A fortnight ago, when New Indian Express visited the market, the scenario had been similar but today a stoic acceptance of reality has set it. Debit and credit cards are being accepted now and traders said they are contemplating buying card swipe machines shortly.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said retailers not placing big orders because customers are holding on to any money they have. Stocks in the warehouses have dwindled. Its a panic situation, he said.Lahotis own company, Sunil & Co, used to purchase 3,000 bags (50 kg per bag) of sona masuri rice every month. Demand has fallen steeply since November 9 and he bought only 1,400 bags of rice in the last 30 days. He has cut his stock of dals down from 40 tonnes to 20.Perishables like onions and potatoes continue to move but slowly. Purchases are down 40 per cent and mostly on credit, Krishnappa said. The market sources 52,391 quintals of onion per day (over 2.10 lakh bags) from Chitradurga, Bagalkot, Chalakere and Gadag districts at a cost of Rs 4.33 crore per day paid to farmers through the 100 commission agents based here. The quantity of purchases has remained the same in the demonetization month but post-dated cheques with a 45-day credit period are being handed out for about 40 per cent of the produce. The market used to accept 15-day post-dated cheques earlier.The markets Coconut Traders Association president V Manjunath said the coconut business has gone down by 50 per cent. Coconuts arrive in trucks from Tiptur, Kanakpura, Pandavapura, Channapatna, Mysuru and Hassan. His own business is continuing to tick but only because he accepts accepts cheques and demand drafts.  I used to sell a minimum of 10,000 coconuts per day and a maximum of 50,000. In the past one month, my minimum has been 3,000 and the maximum has not crossed 25,000, he said."

Cost of veggies imported from other states, however, has increased 10% to 30% with shortfall in supply because of transportation hassles. Similarly, rate of seasonal fruits imported from other states and countries have increased by 35% to 50%.Wholesale dealer at the galla mandi Manish Rastogi said potatoes are perishable in nature and come from nearby areas like Kannauj. Since these farmers are not able to get their produce transported to other states, they are dumping the crop in the local market, leading to crash in prices by 50%. Similar is the situation with cauliflower, cabbage and other locally grown season vegetables whose prices have gone down by 30%-75%.Prices of onion and peas has gone up 30% and 8%, recently in the past one month because of drop in supply .Onions are imported from Madhya Pradesh and Maha rashtra and peas from Punjab.""Following the currency crisis, transporters are not running their fleets in full strength. As a result, we are not receiving sufficient supply,"" said Ajay Yadav at Chinhat Mandi. This is also responsible for rise in prices of fruits.Price of tomatoes, which are imported from Karnataka, however, has gone down 10%.The reason, say vegetable dealers, is the highly perishable nature of the vegetable.Retailers said they are forced to sell vegetables at low prices because of drop in demand. ""Those who can afford are preferring super markets for cashless purchase. Earlier, they used to come to us to buy fresh vegetables. This has also led to drop in demand,"" said Rehmat Ali, a greengrocer in Dandaiya market. Sale has also dropped because of lack of loose change. ""People give us Rs 2,000 note and we don't have change, so no transaction takes place,"" said Rajendra Prasad at Nishatganj mandi.Vishakha Dubey, a school teacher who had come to buy fruits said first of all you need to carry change loads the purse and then the prices of fruits have shot up as there are not enough Rs 100 notes in the market."
320,Facing a big change over small change,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2016/dec/09/facing-a-big-change-over-small-change-1547130.html,2016-12-09,The New Indian Express,"CHENNAI: When K Jayaramans customers, mostly small-time vendors, visit his wholesale shop in the Koyambedu market at 3 am, they would have already exchanged all the tens and twenties they had made the previous day to either Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 notes that could be carried in their surukku pai (small drawstring pouch) easily at that odd hour.Things have changed since demonetisation. They now bring several currencies of smaller denominations that makes it more difficult for transactions in a wholesale shop like ours, he said.But, that is the least of Jayaramans worries. Ever since the high-value note ban, his shop has seen a 60 per cent drop in footfalls, said Jayaraman, while some customers had to be simply turned away due to the owners inability to issue change.Consequently, their income has halved and their profits are close to nothing, said Jayaraman and his friend M Abdul Khader, who runs a vegetable shop in the market, agrees. This month, I had to send four of my 10 labourers to Bihar where they come from, since I couldnt afford them, Jayaraman added.Apart from that, wastage has been a constant source of worry, said shop owners. For instance, a vegetable shop owner claimed to have lost around 4,000 kg from a load of 25,000 kg during the last month.Before this, wastage was contained to around 1,500 to 2,000 kg, he said.As a result, shop owners in the market have increasingly turned to onions and tubers like potatoes and yam that have a slightly longer shelf life. Likewise, fruit vendors stock up apples that can be preserved in cold storage for around two months.In Koyambedu, Asias largest perishable goods market, around 600 trucks arrive every morning - around 400 trucks of vegetables and 200 trucks of fruits. Flowers are usually carried in bags and baskets, brought to the market by the vendors themselves in share autos or buses.While calling off the days load would seem like the best way forward considering the previous days load has not been sold, vendors like Jayaraman, who have been in business for over 45 years, have an image to protect.If the trucks dont arrive even for one morning, the neighbouring shops would take notice and the word will spread.Its not good for business.Produce arrives at the market from across the country - watermelons from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, apples from Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, malta (blood oranges) from Ganganagar in Punjab, seedless grapes from Solapur and sapotas from closer home in Tirupattur.The key, said wholesale dealers, was to retain the customers at all costs. Some retailers have the option of closing their shop for a month and going to their hometowns for other work. We cannot do that, said Jayaraman, adding that their business was based on reliability. If we close our shops even for two days, they will find the next shop and move on, he said.So despite the wastage, they accept the next days load and find other ways to cut down expenditure.Abdul Khader, for one, has canceled all family outings until business returns to normal.In addition to their losses, shop owners said they were charged a maintenance fee of Rs 1 per square feet a month.Hence, for an average shop owner with a 1,200 square feet shop, Rs 1,200 would have to be paid.However, business has begun looking up in the market, say dealers. The last few days, sales has gone up by around10-20 per cent. So, were hopeful, Jayaraman said.On November 8, the price of tomatoes in the market was a mere Rs 4 per kg, according to the vendors, when usually a kg was priced at Rs 12.Last week, before Ammas death, it was Rs 7 per kg, said Abdul Khader."
321,"Demonetisation, not drought, behind farming community’s woes",http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2016/dec/11/demonetisation-not-drought-behind-farming-communitys-woes-1547778.html,2016-12-11,The New Indian Express,"At a time when the Indian economy is faced with a slowdown, it is the farming sector that stands crippled. Suffering from back-to-back drought for two years, demonetisation has struck a severe blow.I am sure it will be sometimes before a clearer picture emerges. But all efforts to paint a bright picture for agriculture are now beginning to fall apart. While the serpentine queues in the urban areas show no signs of ending even after a month of demonetisation, the picture in the rural areas remains too bleak. With the bank branches not getting adequate cash, I know of villages where the farmers had to return empty handed even after seven days of queuing up.What makes it worse is the fact, as Prof Ram Kumar of Tata Institute of Social Studies points out, that nearly 81 per cent of the villages do not have access to bank branches.Despite the Ministry of Agricultures claim of a higher sowing of rabi crops as compared with the area sown in previous year, reality checks portray a different picture. The area under wheat sowing was being deliberately compared with the sowings accomplished in 2015, the year of drought. When you compare 17.4 million hectares of wheat sowing achieved by December 4, with the corresponding figures of 21.3 and 20.9 mn hectares in 2013 and 2014 respectively, it reveals the shortfall.While much had been written about the difficulties encountered by the farmers in undertaking sowing operations, they faced severe blow when the market crashed post demonetisation. Even a month after, the mandis in several cities are partially operating.With the demand subdued, prices have fallen across the board Only a day ago, farmers in Paththal town in Chhattisgarh dumped tomatoes on the national highway to express their discontent at the decrease in prices. With trucks failing to arrive this year, the rich tomato pocket of Chhattisgarh saw prices lowering to 50 paise per kg. Again, a few days back, farmers distributed potatoes free-of-cost outside the Vidhan Sabha in Lucknow.Vegetable and fruit growers have been hit the hardest with prices slumping to as low as 45-50 per cent. Cauliflower in Bihar and tomato in Andhra Pradesh were selling at `1 per kg; nearly three lakh tonnes of potato seed in cold storages in Punjab found no buyer; dairy farmers found themselves at the receiving end on failing to buy fodder for cattle. Many such reports have been pouring in from across India. With no government succor, arhtiyas (money lenders) came to farmers rescue at many places, especially after the cooperative banks or societies became non-functional.Considering that 2016-17 witnessed a normal monsoon except in Karnataka and parts of Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, I was expecting some kind of revival in the farm economy.Knowing that the farmers are not being paid a remunerative price for years, they have to depend on the rain gods to bail them out of dire situation. And this year, the rain gods didnt disappoint. However, the demonetisation move proved to be a big blow for the farmers, the impact of which would be felt by them for quite long.hunger55@gmail.com"

Business at the market has seen a slump. (Express Photo: Amit Mehra) Hundreds of workers have been flocking to Azadpur mandi. Business at the market has seen a slump. (Express Photo: Amit Mehra)Post demonetisation, the slump in businesses across the capital has not just reduced the demand for workers but has also increased supply of cheap labour. This, in turn, has caused wages to plummet.Shabeer, a 57-year-old permanent worker in a steel untensil manufacturing unit in northwest Delhis Wazirpur, was told that November 10 would be his last working day. After paying their salaries in banned currency notes, the owner of the unit sacked 70 workers, including Shabeer, because orders for utensils had come to an absolute halt.Like Shabeer, thousands of workers have been fired or sent on forced leave in Wazirpur industrial area  which houses roughly 1,000 utensil and steel manufacturing units and employs roughly 70,000 workers. While most workers have been making their way back home to villages in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, many decided to stay back in the capital.Watch what else is making news:I decided to look for alternate work. Azadpur mandi usually has work for loaders and off-loaders. If I go back home, I would only burden my family so I decided to give it another shot in the city, he said.When Shabeer went to Azadpur mandi in mid-November looking for work, a few shopkeepers and contractors agreed to hire him. However, while the going rate for off-loading a 10 kg sack of onions was over Rs 20, Shabeer was being offered Rs 13 instead. I agreed because it was better than nothing. I would make Rs 200 a day, he said.Jitender Kumar, another worker at the mandi, said he made on Rs 100 on Sunday. He spend Rs 50 on lunch and saved the rest for dinner. Hundreds like Shabeer and Karan have been flocking to the mandi for work, but business at the market too has seen a slump.Rajender Sharma, president of the Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Traders Associations, said, Not only have prices of vegetables fallen, sales have fallen by 20-30 per cent, most customers are buying on credit. Around 80 per cent of my sales last month has been on credit.Sharma, who sells onions and potatoes at the mandi, said labourers are paid as per a fixed fare chart decided by the government. Other shopkeepers admitted that because business was down, ancillary work has been affected.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

324,Potato prices drop as cold storages clear stock,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Potato-prices-drop-as-cold-storages-clear-stock/articleshow/55930204.cms,2016-12-12,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: Expectation of a bumper potato crop this year has made cold storage owners begin clearing their stock with zeal resulting in a steep drop in wholesale prices of potatoes. Potatoes, which according to quality were fetching wholesale prices between Rs4 and Rs11 per kg, just a week ago, are now being sold at Rs1.5-Rs6 per kg. In the retail market, prices of potatoes have climbed down from Rs18-Rs22 per kg to Rs11-Rs15 per kg.Deepak Patel, secretary, APMC, Ahmedabad, said, ""Last year at this time, potato prices were at Rs8 to Rs10 per kg, but this year it has dropped to Rs1.5 per kg. The potatoes we are getting now are local potatoes, which are from cold storage.""Speaking on the price drop of potatoes, Kishorekumar Lachhmandas Paryani, a trader in APMC, Ahmedabd, said, ""The old stock is being released from cold storages thus leading to the drop in prices."" Paryani said last year's crop was bountiful and thus the amount of potatoes stocked in cold storages was higher than usual.""Old stock will continue to be released for another month until the new potato crop starts arriving,"" said Paryani.Retailers, however, are of the opinion that there will be no further price drop, and that prices have stabilized.Richa shah a homemaker from Satellite said, ""I don't know whether potato prices will remain low in the coming days, and so I have decided to make and store potato wafers, which I usually do on arrival of the new crop."" She was happy that prices of most vegetables have dropped.Farmers in the state had received good prices for their crops in April 2016 despite 15% increase in production. As compared to Rs5-Rs6 per kg they received for potatoes in April 2015, in 2016, the new crop had fetched them around Rs10 per kg in the wholesale markets.Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda. Potatoes from Gujarat are supplied to Maharashtra and states in South India. They are also exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Mauritius."

If we don't have money, how can we pay our labourers, farmer, and transporter? said Metharam Kriplani, president of Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders.Some market players said tax authorities have raided big traders in Azadpur, a major regional hub. Others said sellers were reluctantly accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from large buyers.For how long can you run a business in debt? Even paying half amount to farmers for their sale of produce is not solving the problem as it is leading to poor supplies and lowering the purchasing power of traders. The market will crash, said Mukesh Tiwari, past chairman of Ghazipur mandi. The solution is to install card machines, said Balkrishan Sharma, who buys vegetables worth Rs 1-2 lakh a day for 50-100 vegetable vendors.Kriplani, an apple trader, said prices have fallen in the past four days from Rs 30 to Rs 20 a kg. Its a big loss for farmers. Further, the business is down by 30%-40%.Agricultural markets look deserted and offer ample parking space and very few trucks. Onion trader Abid Ali of Abdul Alin and Company said the number of trucks from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka, where the harvest was going on, has fallen. With lack of buyers  small street vendors, shopkeepers and aggregators for hotels and restaurants  the sale has crashed. Onion price in mandis is in the range of Rs 5-Rs 10 a kg, while in retail, it is selling at Rs 30/kg.Tuntun Bhagat, who retails vegetables in east Delhi, said. The first two days, I gave credit to regular customers, but since I didnt have the money, I couldnt get supplies. On Saturday, I stood in line for five hours and today I have been able to comake a purchase.With potato harvest season beginning in Punjab and Himachal, farmers and aggregators like Bilal from Una are not happy. We are not getting good rates. Then there is fight over notes.Surjit Mandal had brought banana and colocasia plant (arbi) from Meerut to the Ghazipur mandi. I took a Rs 4,000 loan to come here expecting to earn Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000. But therere no buyers, he said.Farmers are delaying payments to labourers who cut the produce, gunny bag sellers, transporters and mandi workers. Those who trust me are giving me their service. I am also trusting the babu who said he will pay me half for my produce and rest after a month, said Iqbal from Shamli.The babu Iqbal was referring to is Mukesh Dhingra, a trader in Ghazipur, who has a huge pile of cauliflower and hardly any buyer. Ani Kumar, who trades capsicum, has even asked farmers not to send produce as he did not have money."

330,Cash wash deals wholesale blow ,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161214/jsp/odisha/story_124547.jsp,2016-12-14,Telegraph,"Cuttack, Dec. 13: Subhas Chatoi, a trader, has been finding it extremely difficult to arrange funds for payments of labourers engaged in loading and unloading of commodities on a daily basis at Chatra Bazaar, the largest wholesale and retail vegetable market in the state here. Not only Chatoi, many other traders at the mandi are facing problems in arranging smaller currency notes even after almost one month of the demonetisation. Most of the traders have to depend on the cash collected from the daily sale of their products to make payments to labourers and meet other expenses. The cash crunch has adversely affected the overall business transactions of the traders at Chatra Bazaar by almost 30 per cent in the past one month. ""Though most of the traders here have started to make payments through cheques to their counterparts in neighbouring states, we are facing problems as we have to make daily payments to the labourers in smaller currency notes, which are not readily available,"" said Chatoi. Chatoi also claimed that the closure of banks for three consecutive days also had led to shortage of cash as most of the ATMs also ran dry till late in the afternoon today. ""I could not make payments to my staff and labourers as I had withdrawn cash for the last time on Friday. The retail traders are also making payments to us in new Rs 2,000 currencies. The situation at the market is unlikely to improve till supply of Rs 500 notes are not increased along with the weekly withdrawal cap of Rs 24,000 per week,"" Chatoi added. Around 5,000 people comprising wholesale, retail traders, middlemen, farmers and labourers are directly involved in the daily fruits and vegetable trade at Chatra bazaar that caters to the bulk of the vegetable requirement not only for the people of Cuttack but for nearby cities also. Chatra bazaar usually registers a daily business to the tune of Rs 2 to 3 crore and 50 to 60 trucks are engaged in transportation of goods to other parts of the state. Now, only 25 to 35 trucks are arriving on a daily basis here. ""There was sharp fall in the booking of stocks from neighbouring states, including Andhra Pradesh and Bengal, during initial period of the demonetisation. However, the situation has improved considerably in the past one week,"" said Kedarnath Lenka, another trader. Lenka said that a truck full of vegetables from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh costs nearly Rs 50,000 to Rs 55,000 per trip, while daily payments to labourers vary from Rs 2,000 to 3, 500 per day, including some cash payment to drivers. Earlier, all the traders used to make payments in cash through the drivers arriving from various states with commodities. A senior member of the Chatra Bazaar traders association, Devendra Sahu said despite the financial crisis, there had been no hike in the prices of vegetables in the past one month due to good harvest and production of locally produces from Athgarh, Banki and other nearby areas in the district. ""The retail traders are now depending on the vegetables such as cauliflower, cucumber, tomatoes, brinjals grown by farmers of nearby areas to meet the requirements. As a result, there is no pressure on wholesale traders for bulk import of such vegetables which are perishable items from the neighbouring states,"" said Sahu. Traders at Chatra Bazaar mostly imports tomatoes, peas, coconuts, pumpkin, potatoes and other vegetables and fruits including apple, orange and grapes from neighbouring states, including Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Maharastra."

Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Wednesday showed inflation , as measured by the wholesale price index rose annual 3.2% in November, slower than previous month's 3.4%.The softening in WPI inflation comes close on the heels of retail inflation easing to a two-year low of 3.6% in November. The government revised upwards the inflation for September to 3.8% from the previously reported 3.6%.The move to scrap some high value currency notes has dented consumer demand and hurt industries and there have been demands for a cut in interest rates to boost demand.The latest data showed food inflation slowed to 1.5% in November, compared to 4.3% rise in the previous month. RBI relies largely on the retail inflation measure although it takes into account all price data, while finalising monetary policy.The WPI data showed vegetable prices slid 24.1% in November, while onion prices contracted 51.5%. But some pressure points were visible as wheat prices rose 10.7%, potato 36.9% year-on-year and sugar 31.7% during the month. The fuel, power and light index rose 7% in November, up from previous month's 6.2%.""WPI inflation has come at 3.15% due to subdued food prices. However, we expect the rate to hover around 4% mainly due to firming up of core inflation and a rise in food prices once the base effect weakens. Also the rabi crop will be critical in driving future prices as the present cash crunch has slowed down the rabi sowing especially for wheat,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings said."

Despite a repeat of the situation year after year, concrete steps are yet to be taken by the State Government to redress the woes of the vegetable growers.Vegetable farmers in Bargarh district, cotton growers of Balangir, Kalahandi and Nuapada districts, onion cultivators of Titilagarh in Balangir district and maize farmers of Nabarangpur district continue to suffer heavy losses due to Government apathy.Lack of basic infrastructure to store their produce too has hit them hard with farmers in several areas getting returns much less than the cost of production. With no other option to earn a livelihood, they toil hard in the fields only to earn peanuts. While the middlemen and traders reap benefits, the farmers continue to suffer and the State Government prefer to close its eyes to their problem.To add to their woes, demonetisation has eaten into their small market scope and farmers have decided not to harvest their crop as it would propel them into penury from poverty. Take for instance, while people in the State may find vegetable cheaper during the winter, in Bargarh cauliflower, cabbage, flat beans, French beans, cucumber and brinjal are sold at Rs 10 a kg, bitter gourd is priced at Rs 15, tomato Rs 5 a kg, chilly and snake bean at Rs 20, green peas at Rs 30, melon, radish and potato at Rs 5 a kg, while onion is priced at Rs 8.The only two costly vegetables are ladies finger sold at Rs 20 and potol which is priced at Rs 30. If vegetable farmers are to be believed they get 40 per cent of the market rate of vegetables.Since harvesting involves much more cost than the price they are offered for the produce, farmers prefer not to harvest it. Sushil Sahu of Sirigida village in Sohela block of Bargarh district had cultivated tomato over seven acres of land and had spent Rs 2 lakh on seeds, pesticide and fertiliser besides labour. Though his tomato crop has ripped it is left to rot in the field as neither harvesting is financially feasible nor the price offered is lucrative enough to help him recover the cost of production.Similar is the story of Rajendra Barik and Sachi Barik of the village. There is no buyer for tomato even at Rs 1 per kg, they said. The tomato farmers are more worried over repayment of their loans. Recalling that they had sold tomato at 0.25 paise in past, they said the situation has not improved. Cauliflower, cabbage and brinjal too are likely to meet the same fate when harvesting peaks.Chilli harvesting has already gone the tomato way and farmer Faguni Biswal of Balijuri village under Bargarh block has allowed the crop to ripen than invest on harvesting it which would entail more cost. Deputy Director, Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das said more than bumper crop, it is demonetisation which has pushed farmers to the brink.Demonetisation has been creating a transactional problem and keeping traders away. While the only cold storage in the district at Barpali is lying defunct, proposal is in the pipeline for developing two cold storages, one in Bargarh and another in Padampur. He hoped that things would improve after it gets operational.Meanwhile, farmers said the availability of a cold storage, food processing industries, development of mandi and marketing system would have helped them get right price for their produce."

It was better to distribute potatoes free to people, they contended.Patwari, who represents Rau assembly constituency, led about 200 farmers to Rajwada when they and their potato laden tractors were stopped near Manikbag.

Officials fear the business in the district may collapse if cash scarcity continues to haunt farmers for a few more days.""The daily collection is dropping rapidly. We are assessing the damage. About 90% of cash transactions and payments made to milk producer farmers are through Pune District Central Cooperative Bank. The situation has worsened with RBI putting restrictions on transactions through district banks. These farmers are not getting cash. It has directly affected milk production and collection,"" Vishnu Hinge, chairman of Katraj Dairy, told TOI. He added that many farmers have no money to buy fodder and maintain cattle.Katraj officials said most farmers don't have bank accounts and depend on the local cooperative society for payments. Local societies are connected to Katraj Dairy and get money from district banks.Members of Katraj Dairy and district central cooperative bank recently met NCP president Sharad Pawar to discuss the problems faced by farmers and dairy business. ""It is not only milk, but even routine lives of farmers are affected. There is little sowing activity in rabi season as loan disbursement has come to a standstill and rates for produce like potato have declined,"" Hinge said.However, speaking at an interactive session organised by the Pune Union of Working Journalists (PUWJ), minister of state for agriculture Sadabhau Khot said, ""Farmers are happy with the demonetisation decision as they are going to reap the benefits in the long term."""

Export of potatoes used for making snacks has increased in the last few years and will grow further with rising demand, experts at the International exhibition of cold chain expo said on Friday.The claims about good prospects for potatoes came at a time when a strong protest was held here by farmers who claim that potato prices have come down to Re 1 per kg. Manohar Shardiya, managing director of a cold storage said, ""With a rise in the snacks industry, demand for potato is growing rapidly in the state. Malwa potatoes are preferred for exports because of its high quality and taste. Top quality potatoes are exported while average and inferior ones are sent to local markets for consumption.""According to data from the agriculture department, farmers have sown vegetables that include potato and garlic on 30,000 hectares in the region this rabi season as against the target of 22,000 hectares.With disposable income in the country on the rise, the snacks industry is growing at a rate of over 10 per cent per annum according to experts.""Rapid growth of the snacks industry is boasting of a high demand for potatoes. The need for cold storages has also gone up so that produce can be stored longer and quality can be maintained,"" Shardiya said.With the upgrading of technology and rising production, the trend for multi-commodity cold storage chambers is rising in the country. Of 65 cold storages in Indore district, 40 are multi-commodity cold units.There are 210 cold storages in Madhya Pradesh Hansmukh Jain Gandhi, president, MP cold chain Industries Association said, ""The state has great potential to become a hub for cold storages due to its demographic advantage and high production of fruits and vegetables. Production of potatoes, cabbage, carrots and fruit such as oranges have grown in the past few years.""However, experts said that the state should improve its technology and farmers should get connected with the market for better opportunities. Pawanexh Kohli, CEO and chief advisor, National Centre for Cold chain Development said the state has the potential to build more cold storages but the selling radius for farmers should be expanded so that they can connect with their own choice of markets."

ANKITA DWIVEDI JOHRI travels with a dance orchestra to a village in the interiors of Allahabad, the heart of the wedding entertainment industry. Photographs by Oinam AnandEk sundar bala, madhubala, sheetal ka anubhav karane aa rahi hain husn ki rani Simran. Zordaar taliyaan With a twirl and a hip thrust, Sonia emerges from behind a soiled curtain and delicately glides into the neon haze generated by the smoke machine. The men in the audience, over 70 of them, have their gaze transfixed on her. Several mobile phones, all set in video mode, go up. The women, only a few of them, seated across the aisle, look on awkwardly.Mujhko ranaji maaf karna galti maare se ho gayi The loudspeakers blare out the 90s chartbuster and Sonia, dressed in a shimmery peach lehenga tied below her navel and a sheer dupatta, with an ornate sash around her waist, swirls and sashays to its beats. For the next three minutes, Sonia goes through her dance moves with practised ease. Her face breaks into an occasional smile when the emcee, Raja, says, Ise kehtein hain artiste taliyaan (This is who you call an artist. Applause). But for the rest of the performance, her face is largely impassive. A few men climb onto the stage and throw a few Rs 20 notes at her and she obliges them with a thumka, nothing more.Sapna is the star performer at Mau Dostpur. A Bhojpuri industry sensation, she has starred in over 35 videos and commands a higher price than the other girls. Sapna is the star performer at Mau Dostpur. A Bhojpuri industry sensation, she has starred in over 35 videos and commands a higher price than the other girls.Sonia Jaiswal, 30, who goes by the stage name Simran, is a wedding dancer. Tonight, she is performing at a reception party in Mau Dostpur village in Mau Aima town, nearly 40 km from Allahabad, the heart of the wedding orchestra, in eastern Uttar Pradesh. An online search for Allahabad arkestra throws up nearly 5,000 dance videos and and even more on private sharing forums. The contents are the same: women dancing to hit Bollywood and Bhojpuri film songs, before a largely male audience.A thriving industry in Allahabad for almost 40 years, the little-known world of wedding dancers made headlines in August this year when 32 girls trafficked from Chhattisgarh were rescued from an orchestra in the city. More recently, a wedding dancer was shot dead during a performance in Bathinda in Punjab, once again turning the spotlight on the lack of regulation and security in this largely unorganised industry.Sonia didnt let these events play on her mind as she set off from Allahabad in a Tavera with her group around 5.30 pm. She has been hired for this wedding season by Mohammad Arif, 42, the owner of Payal Orchestra who goes by the name Marshall. Today she is accompanied by two other woman dancers, a male singer, 10 orchestra artistes, the emcee, and her husband, Saurabh, a dance organiser. Mau Dostpur mein transformer ke paas (near the transformer) is all they had for an address. The dense fog and bumpy village path stretched their hour-and-a-half journey by another 60 minutes.I saw the video of the firing incident, it was frightening. It can happen to anyone, says Sonia, who has been working for the past 15 years and has two sons, aged 12 and 5. She earns Rs 3,500 for a performance and gets to keep 50 per cent of the money tossed at her on stage. Most men are drunk at such events and fights are common. Aur mujhe kabhi pata nahin hota hum kahan ja rahe hain (And I never know where we are going to perform). Earlier, I used to be scared, but now I understand its all just part of the job, she says.Girls head to the toilet, get a lot of unwanted attention. Girls head to the toilet, get a lot of unwanted attention.Now, sitting cross-legged on a mattress in a 1010 enclosure under a stairway, their green room for tonight, Sonia is preening into a hand-held mirror, fixing her lip gloss and blush with swift strokes. Scattered around her are bags full of embellished clothes, imitation jewellery and make-up. In a corner, Seema Rawat, a.k.a Sapna, hurriedly slips into a red lehenga as the emcee calls out her name from the stage behind their room: Welcome the queen of heavenMake-up mein zyada time lag gaya (Make-up took a long time), Sapna tells Marshall, who walks into the room without knocking, urging her to hurry up. A final glance in the mirror and happy with her look  green lenses, fake lashes, silver eye-shadow and wavy hair extensions  she sprints towards the stage.Sapna is tonights star performer. A Bhojpuri industry sensation, she has starred in over 35 videos and commands a higher price than the other girls. Sapna ko dekh kar log stage pe paise bhi zyaada phenktein hain (People throw a lot more money on her on stage), says Marshall, sneaking peaks at Sapna, as she takes to the stage.As the 26-year-old gyrates to the tunes of the hit Bhojpuri song Chalakata hamro jawaniya, the audience goes into a frenzy. Unlike Sonia, Sapna is all smiles and expression, engaging with the men who have clambered onto the stage. And like Marshall had predicted, this time, the money comes in Rs 100 notes.The audience only wants Bhojpuri these days. Sab double-meaning songs hain, mujhe toh bhasha samajh bhi nahin aati (The songs are full of innuendo, I dont even understand the language), says Sonia, changing into her next outfit, a yellow lehenga. She wears a black slip inside to avoid any wardrobe malfunction on stage. On stage, everyone wants to touch us I pin my dupatta tightly. Mai toh sober dance karti hoon taki mahaul kharab na ho (I prefer sober moves so that the crowd doesnt go beserk), she says, as her husband Saurabh arrives with plates of noodles.As the girls take to the stage, several mobile phones, all set to video mode, go up. There are few women in the audience As the girls take to the stage, several mobile phones, all set to video mode, go up. There are few women in the audiencePehle paani toh pilwado (Get us water first), she yells at her husband, her voice drowned by the music on stage. She gestures to indicate water and Saurabh gets the message. They only want us to come and perform; no one is bothered about our food or water. At least here we have a room to change; in most villages, we are put up in a tent outside the stage. Koi izzat nahin hai (There is no respect), she says, now asking her husband, who has returned with a bottle of water, to find her earring which she has dropped on stage. He rushes off once again.In the wedding season, we perform at around five functions. The events continue till early morning and we get to sleep for only two-three hours. It gets very tiring, she says, relieved to see her husband return with her missing earring.Soon, Sapna walks into the room after her performance, all huffing and puffing. We have a break, she announces. Dulhe ke bhatija ka birthday hai, singer happy birthday gayenge abhi (Its the grooms nephews birthday. The singers will sing the birthday song), she says. She then asks Sonia if her husband can escort them to the toilet across the courtyard of the house.Saurabh instructs the girls to wrap themselves with shawls and walk behind him. As they step out of the room, all eyes are on them. The grooms friends, the cooks and cleaners and a few women guests look on as the girls walk, eyes on the ground, behind Saurabh. The girls take turns to use the only toilet in the house as Saurabh waits outside. A few men approach him and try to strike up a conversation. He ignores them and accompanies his wife and the other two dancers back to their room. The group of men trails them all the way up to the room and disperses only after Marshall intervenes.Sonia gets to keep 50 per cent of the money tossed at her on stage. Sonia gets to keep 50 per cent of the money tossed at her on stage.Once a source of entertainment for the landed gentry, over the years, wedding dancers have begun catering to people across social and economic strata. Earlier, the Thakurs and Brahmins organised mujras for their guests, where tawaifs (courtesans) performed. Sometime in the 70s, orchestra groups replaced the mujras and became accessible to everyone, says Shukla.But while these performances became accessible and affordable to more people, the lack of regulation and security has left the dancers vulnerable to exploitation  women have to perform in distant villages, before largely male audiences, with no police or security cover. Thats the security that Sonia found in Saurabh. Things can get out of hand at these functions. If not for Saurabh, I wouldnt have been able to continue in this job for so long, says Sonia.As the night grows darker and colder, the women and children leave the venue. Around 10 pm, it is time for Sonias next performance.This time, as she dances to Lata Mangeshkars 80s chartbuster Kaliyon ka chaman, her performance picks pace, the moves are racier and she even mouths the lyrics. Many in the audience move towards the stage, more money is hurled and Marshall is a happy man. Saurabh watches it all from a corner of the stage.*****In Allahabad, the world of wedding orchestra unfolds in the lanes of Kydganj, a locality that houses both the offices and the homes of its many managers, singers, dancers, announcers and musicians. Back in 1983, an orchestra group here gave Prashant Gautam his first break as a congo player. I later moved to drums, became a singer and announcer, and finally set up Gautam Orchestra in 1997, he says, sitting in his small office whose walls are lined with photographs from his days as a musician.Workers at the Mau Dostpur reception sneak a peak at the dancers. Workers at the Mau Dostpur reception sneak a peak at the dancers.Today, at 52, he says he is disillusioned with the industry. In Kydganj, there are over 150 orchestra groups, but they can hardly be called artistes. Teen dancer aur dedh metre ke banner ke saath sab apne aap ko orchestra group bolte hain (Anybody with three dancers and a one-and-a-half metre banner calls himself an orchestra), he says, angrily calling up dancers who havent arrived yet. His group has to perform at a wedding in a few hours.All of them must be sleeping. No rehearsals, no riyaz (practice) Bhojpuri orchestra has killed the industry. We used to sing songs of Lata, Rafi and Kishore and dancers did kathak. Now every time a singer gets on stage, audience usko bhaga deti hai (the audience hoots him out). Now they say, Bhaisaab, sirf dancer chahiye (they say, we only want dancers). And we are left catering to the demands of the dancers, he says. The wedding season is a headache, we are better off doing jagrans during Navratis. At least people listen to devotional songs out of fear of God, he says.Wedding entertainment, or janwasa as it is referred to in UP and Bihar, is an old tradition. In the early days, the brides family arranged for such functions for the grooms friends. Similar events were also organised by the grooms family after the wedding. Today, janwasas are limited to villages, and orchestra groups travel hundreds of kilometres to make such appointments.Wedding entertainment, or janwasa as it is referred to in UP and Bihar, is an old tradition. Wedding entertainment, or janwasa as it is referred to in UP and Bihar, is an old tradition.Ravi Shukla, or Ravi Raj, as he is known in orchestra circuits, remembers making a 700-km trip to Gondia in Maharashtra, only to find out that all the grooms friends had left before they could reach. A dance broker today, he says that while such setbacks are a part of the job, what irks him is peoples attitudes towards the industry. Bobby mein Dimpleji ne bikini pehna tha, swimming kiya tha (In the movie Bobby, Dimple Kapadia wore a bikini and swam), but you could watch the film with your family. That is because peoples thoughts were clean. In the 90s, parents of dancers and singers accompanied them to janwasa functions and watched the show. But around the year 2000, vulgar Bhojpuri songs were released and it all went downhill from there. Now no parent wants their children to join orchestras. It has become a big taboo, says Shukla, who gets dancers to Allahabad from Delhi, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar during the wedding season.He says its the taboo that has forced dancers to assume stage names. Till the 90s, dancers used their own names. They were famous artistes and people adored them. But over the past 15 years, since the advent of Bhojpuri orchestra, dancers have started seeking anonymity, says Shukla, who started his own career in the 80s as a jagran singer. At one point, we even tried to introduce duets, but they failed miserably. The men in the audience would get on stage and push the male dancer out, he says.Playing the video of the Bathinda firing on his phone, Shukla says, This is another worry. I am the local guardian for these girls. If something happens to them, I will be held responsible. I often warn them to stay alert and remain in their rooms after the performance These girls are smart, they know how to take care of themselves, he says, now making his way to the rented accommodation behind his office, where three of his dancers stay.*****Before she sets out for her performance at night, Sonia has to cook for her in-laws. Before she sets out for her performance at night, Sonia has to cook for her in-laws.Seven years ago, Jyoti, a resident of Punjabi Bagh in west Delhi, told her mother that she had landed a job at a neighbourhood beauty parlour. Her mother, who worked as a tailor, was elated. After her husbands death, the family was going through a rough time, and with seven daughters and a son to take care of, any income was welcome. What Jyoti didnt tell her family was that she had, in fact, taken up an offer to become a wedding dancer.My first performance was at a village near Gurgaon. I got Rs 800 for it. Fortunately, I was part of a group dance and simply copied what the seniors did. For outstation performances, I would tell my mother that I have been hired for make-up by the brides family. This time too I said the same thing, she says, sitting in a dingy room with pink cobwebbed walls in Kydganj. She has been hired by Shukla for this wedding season and he takes care of her accommodation and meals during the months. Two other girls  Esha from Delhi, who performed at the Mau Dostpur reception the previous night, and Nisha from Punjab  share the room with her.I take this place on rent for four months a year and hire a cook-cum-cleaner for the girls, says Shukla. The room is small, with a bed, a few racks and no windows. There are clothes, mostly embellished ones, and imitation jewellery strewn all over the place.As Jyoti informs Shukla that she is unwell and cant travel to Sultanpur, 100 km away, to perform, Shukla dials another orchestra group to arrange for a dancer and asks Nisha to pack her bags quickly. Around 5 pm, Nisha reluctantly steps out of the bed and asks Jyoti to help her out. Na nahaya, na khaya, bas bhagna padega (I havent taken a shower or eaten anything, I have to rush), says Nisha, who only returned at 5 am that morning from a performance.Sonia at her home Sonia at her homeNisha is my best friend, smiles Jyoti, asking her roommate to wear some perfume. Two years after I became a dancer, I married a man who did odd jobs at the Navy base in Delhi. I quit dancing completely then, but the marriage only lasted two-and-a-half months. He would often get drunk and beat me up. I got a divorce and returned to dancing. Nisha stood by me like a rock during those times, she says.I have a five-year-old son. He stays with my mother. Dancing has helped me pay for his education, she adds. She plans to quit the industry in another three-four years. There is too much pressure. Acha dikhna, gande Bhojpuri gaanon pe nachna, ajeeb logon se milna (You need to look good, dance to vulgar Bhojpuri songs and meet strangers). I am already 28, there are very few years I have anyway, she says, seeing off Nisha, who rides pillion on Shuklas scooty till the main market, where a Qualis with the other orchestra members is waiting for her.Before leaving, Shukla says, Dancers can only work till they are 35. Phir moti ho jati hain, jhuriya aa jati hain (Then they get fat, get wrinkles) and younger dancers replace them. But then, there is Sonia, who you met last night. She has really taken care of herself. She says she is 30, but she must be at least 40.*****There were many things that brought Sonia and Saurabh together 12 years ago. Four years into her job as a wedding dancer in Ludhiana, Sonia arrived in Allahabad from her hometown, Jalandhar. My father, who worked in the Army, died when I was 14. My mother died a few years later. I was their only child and suddenly, I was all alone. An aunty from Ludhiana got me into the profession. I worked with her in Ludhiana for three-four years. She taught me everything  dance, make-up She was the only family I had, she says. When I came to Allahabad for a performance, I decided to stay on.In a new city, Sonia, who only spoke Punjabi then, says she wanted some security, somebody she could rely on. Thats when she met Saurabh.Saurabh had been working as an orchestra organiser for five years and was looking to marry someone from his own profession. We dancers are a kasba (community) and we understand the pressures of the profession. I fell in love with Sonia the first time I saw her perform. Eventually, after two years, I asked her to marry me, he says, struggling to get out of bed around 6 pm. Hum maan gaye, kaise na karte (I agreed, how could I have refused), says Sonia coyly. We had an Arya Samaj wedding, she adds, now instructing her son, Anuj, who has just returned from his tuition classes, to get potatoes from the market. Her younger son is at her sister-in-laws home, a few houses away.After the marriage, Saurabh and his parents moved from their family home to Kydganj. We took this two-room place on rent for Rs 5,000 and have been living here ever since, says Saurabh, getting ready for the evenings performance. After a quick shower, he prays and asks Sonia to prepare dinner for his parents.Prashant Gautam, who runs Gautam Orchestra, one of the oldest in Allahabad Prashant Gautam, who runs Gautam Orchestra, one of the oldest in AllahabadSoon, Anuj returns with a bag of potatoes and hands it to Sonia, who is rolling out chapatis in the kitchen. Still dressed in her night gown, she says, A year ago, I told Anuj I was a dancer. It is better that he gets to know from me, rather than from neighbours. But I dont want him to get into this industry, she says. Par kismat to dekho, iske sar par bhi dance ka bhoot chadha hua hai (But just my luck, even he wants to dance). He watches all the dance reality shows on TV. Turning to her son, she asks, Kaunse show mein jaane ka bolta hai (Which is that show you want to participate in?). DID (Dance India Dance), he responds in a flash. Yes, that one. But I have asked him to study till Class 12 and then think of anything else, she says, preparing the curry.Haan, par do saal baad isko ghar par baithna hai, ab bahut ho gaya dance (Yes, but after two years, she has to sit at home.) I am planning to start my own orchestra group. We will have enough money to take care of the family then, says Saurabh, now ready to set out for one of the last events of the season.The children need me. I have to leave them at my sister-in-laws home every time we go out. If I am not around for them, they will turn wayward, she says, calling out to her father-in-law to say that dinner is ready. But will she miss dancing? Sometimes I wonder what will I do at home all day. I will get bored. Saari zindagi dance hi to kiya hai (I have been dancing all my life), she says."

Vishal Srivastav Amit Shah offers prayers at a temple in Lucknow, on his way to Shahjahanpur, on Saturday. Vishal SrivastavBJP PRESIDENT Amit Shah on Saturday hit out at the Opposition for opposing demonetisation, accusing them of stalling the Winter Session of the Parliament just to sidestep discussion on funding of political parties.Prime Minister Narendra Modi favoured discussion and change in fund raising process of political parties during the all-party meeting at the beginning of Winter Session and said all elections from panchayat to Parliament should be held on the same day, Shah said at his partys Parivartan rally in Shahjahanpur.Watch What Else is Making NewsHe added: But the Opposition did not allow a discussion in the entire Winter Session. They do not have any intention of wiping out blackmoney from politics. Modiji has put forward a view, and I want to appeal to leaders of all Opposition parties that and we should accept discussion on it to bring probity in politics.Continuing his attack on parties opposing demonetisation, Shah said only those whose billions have been reduced to trash are feeling the pain. Have you seen the faces of Mamata (Banerjee) and Mayawati their faces have lost glow, they have started looking 10 years older in a day, he said. In one stroke of the PM, drug dealers, fake currency racketeers, naxalites and terrorists have been set right, he added.Shah went on to list BJPs achievements at the Centre, including power to villages, LPG connections to women and reducing cost of fertilizers.Speaking on tripal talaq, Shah said: For the Modi government, religion comes after womens security and triple talaq should be banned.After the Centre clearly stated its views in the Supreme Court against it, the SP, BSP and Congress have all gone silent, Shah said while appealing to women voters to question these parties on what they are doing for womens rights and whether they agree on triple talaq when they come seeking votes.Should Mulsim women get their rights or not? Modi has worked towards securing the rights of women in the country, Shah asserted.Attacking the ruling SP and Congress possible alliance for the 2017 state polls, Shah said: Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has been saying for a month that SP will get majority in alliance with Congress This indicates that Akhilesh is feeling defeated. He is dreaming of winning with Rahul baba, who will set up potato factory in western UP.Even if all parties come together, the people of UP have decided to vote BJP to power, he added.Stressing that development of UP is possible only when BJP is voted to power with a two-thirds majority, Shah termed SP and BSP as family and caste-based parties, which cannot work for development of the entire society. It has been either chacha-bhatija or bua-bhatija who have been harming the states development in the past 15 years, he said, referring to UP SP chief Shivpal Yadav, Akhilesh and BSP supremo Mayawati.Akhilesh was not allowing the benefits of the central schemes to reach the people as it would increase the popularity of central government, Shah claimed. The benefits of Fasal Bima Yojana could not reach the beneficiaries as there was a tiff for commission between the chahcha and bhatija, he claimed.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The riots had shattered the equations between the Jat and Muslim community in the area, a combined vote base that his party traditionally depended on.He said he had tried for this kind of consolidation of erstwhile socialists or members of the Janata Parivar to bring farmers interests back to the forefront of politics, but it had not been possible.We did try to bring together former socialists of the erstwhile Janata Parivar, at least for a rally and even that did not happen. You will have to ask [Samajwadi Party chief] Mulayam Singh why he didnt come for the rally on October 12, he said.Mr. Singhs party had organised a Kisan Swabhiman rally on October 12 and many members of the erstwhile socialist block had participated in it with Mr. Mulayam Singh being conspicuous by his absence.Mr. Singh has entered into an alliance with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (U) for the U.P. elections.Why scrap import duty?Mr. Singh said the removal of import duty on wheat, coming as it does on the back of expectations of a bumper crop domestically this year (after two years of drought) does not make sense.The imported wheat will be hitting our markets just as procurement will start here. I dont understand the logic unless it is to make sure our farmers dont recover their costs, leave alone make profits, he said. According to him, even in the case of paddy, the situation was dire. While the Minimum Support Price (MSP) is Rs. 1470, the real price offered is around Rs. 800-900 with the Uttar Pradesh government not having set up even purchase centres for paddy.Markets in distressDemonetisation had rung the death knell for vegetable farmers as the largely cash-based supply chain to mandis and retail outlets was shattered, he said.Vegetable farmers, potato farmers are in deep distress. The Central government has no understanding of the rural economy. The importance that the agricultural sector has not just in food production but also in ensuring buoyancy in rural demand and economy in general is not being understood by Delhi.Much of rural demand depends on what a farmer earns in the harvest season, and these policies have jeopardised that, Mr. Ajit Singh added.We tried to bring together members of the erstwhile Janata Parivar, but it did not happen: Ajit Singh"

The new potato crop starts arriving in January in the mandis.Experts HT spoke to were of similar views. The fall in potato prices is more due to seasonal reasons. The production is expected to be more while the impact of demonetisation is limited, said agriculture expert Sachin Bondriya. The potato yield this year is expected to be about 250-300 quintal per acre, about 25% more than last year due to favourable conditions.Manohar Umrao Singh, a farmer who grows potatoes on the outskirts of Indore, said he was watching the prices closely. My crop will be ready in about a months time. However, old potatoes from cold storages have flooded the market and led to price crash.Madhya Pradesh has 210 cold storages, of which 65 are in Indore district.Farmers in Malwa region have been encouraged to grow more potatoes as they are increasingly finding a ready market in food-processing industries and export market in the Gulf. Potatoes grown in Malwa are preferred for exports because of its high quality and taste. While top-quality potatoes are exported, the remaining are sold in local markets.According to data from the agriculture department, farmers have sown vegetables, including potato and garlic, on 30,000 hectares in the region this rabi season, an increase of more than 30% over last year."

Angered over throwaway prices for potatoes, farmers in Gujarat's potato bowl Deesa have started giving a burial to the vegetables. Huge pits have been dug and large quantity of potatoes are being dumped inside with the prices crashing to a record low.Babulal Solanki, general secretary, Potato Growers Association of Banaskantha , said, ""No one is willing to buy the potato even at Rs 60 or Rs 50 for a sack of 50kg. Before demonetization, we were getting Rs 250 per bag.""""Now, we are getting proceeds in the invalid Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes which farmers are not in a position to encash. Farmers need money in small denominations for daily transactions. Buyers from Mumbai, Surat and other places are not prepared to buy potatoes in new currency. As a result, the prices have crashed and growers are cashless. It's simply not affordable as the rent for cold storage is Rs 112 per bag,"" said Solanki.Ganpat Kachhwa, general secretary, Gujarat Cold Storage Owners Association , said, ""At present, we have about 20 lakh potato bags in Banaskantha alone while similar quantity is lying at other cold storages in Vijapur, Dehgam, Modasa and other small places.""""The influx of new crop is expected in February. Since the period of taking back the load was in November 2016, we want to dispose the present stock even free of cost,"" Kachhwa said.The potatoes are being given to the cattle sheds and gaushalas for free in order to vacate the old stock. Farmers themselves are bearing the transportation cost too, said Popat Mali , a potato farmer in Deesa.Last year, the production was 2.84 crore bags of potatoes in Banaskantha while this year it is likely to increase further, he added."

These are A-grade big potatoes that he usually sells at Rs 11 per kg. Had you been five days early, he said, you would have got cauliflower and brinjals too - for free.So what's the catch? Sadly for Prasad, the offer is as unconditional as it is tragic.Like many other farmers here, in the potato belt of Uttar Pradesh that starts near Mathura, about 150 km from Delhi, Prasad has little choice. He can either abandon his crop at cold storages or plough it into the ground as cash appears to have vanished from the market ever since the government on November 8 announced withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as legal tender, rendering invalid 86% of India's currency.A rich crop of potatoes is dumped along the roadside and sacks of potatoes abandoned outside cold storages in the potato belt as farmers are not finding buyers in the mandis.Even if there are some buyers, the rates have crashed, making it uneconomical for the farmers to pay transportation costs and take potatoes to the mandis.Kunwar Raghavendra Singh, former zila panchayat member in Raya, said the farmer is getting a rate of Re 1 per kg.Every year, farmers sow potatoes between October 20 and 30. When the new crop is ready around January end, they sell roughly 20% of the produce in February and the rest is sent to cold storages to be released slowly when the rates get higher.The rates average around Rs 600-800 per katta (a bag of 52 kg). The farmer pays Rs 100 to the cold storage owner for storing his crop. So he gets Rs 11-15 per kg. Prasad, a resident of Sesu Nangla village in Raya, had kept 132 bags in Mansarovar cold storage on Mathura-Aligarh road. ""I am getting no rate right now. For my potatoes I was getting Rs 8 per kg before 'notebandi'.But now it is useless. I have to pay Rs 105 per bag to the cold storage person and then add to it transportation costs. What I would get is just Re 1 per kg in a mandi,"" he said.So Prasad is now selling potatoes to gowshalas. He is getting a measly Rs 50 per bag of 52 kg. ""Rest I will distribute for free in the village,"" he said.Just like Prasad, Nekram of Nagla Amrua village had kept 515 bags of potatoes in Brijwasi cold storage at Raya on Mathura-Aligarh road. He hasn't gone back to claim them. ""I would have to pay the cold storage person for something I cannot sell.What is the point?"" he said. The potato belt supplies to big markets in Jaipur, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Kanpur and Lucknow. With the markets running out of cash, the potatoes are useless.In Sadabad on Mathura-Aligarh road, cold storages have been saddled with thousands of unclaimed potato bags. Pradeep Kumar Singh, owner of Om Sheetgrah , said, ""I have about 5,000 potato bags lying unclaimed. These are farmers who owe me money from before. But what do I do? Everybody is in distress.""The cold storages are shut down mid-November for annual maintenance. Singh ran his facility for an extra month so that he could help the farmers already in distress due to demonetisation But now he has had to dump all the bags outside the cold storage. ""We have dug up a huge pit on the cold storage grounds to dump the produce,"" he said.Just a few kilometres from Singh's cold storage in Khandauli block, farmers have been ploughing their produce in the ground. ""What do we do? We carry these potatoes and vegetables to the market to find no buyers.Even transporting and loading them needs labourers. It is additional cost. We use what we can,"" said Moni Singh of Kharwa village. His neighbour let his cattle out to graze on the dumped vegetables and then ploughed the remaining into the field. ""What else? They are useless,"" he said.Prominent farmer leader and Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samiti national president Pushpendra Chaudhary said, ""The potato farmers have been ruined for the next two years. The markets would not recover even for the sale of rabi crop. The Modi government should at least write off loans of farmers."""

These five firms have combined sales of nearly Rs 3,700 crore, that is higher than Nestle's Maggi , and a few of these firms are larger than Kellogg 's in India.What about the multinationals?GSK Consumer posted negative sales growth in 2015-16 while Pepsi-Co's food division and Mondelez both grew 4%. Experts and company insiders attributed local players' growth to lower price points, increased distribution and conversion from unorganised market.""We have kept our overhead costs low so that our products remain affordable,"" said Chandu Virani, promoter of Balaji Wafers that posted a 14% sales growth last fiscal at Rs 1,440 crore. ""Also, bringing healthier variants and expanding in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh helped,"" he said.On an average, regional snack brands offer 30% higher volume than multinational rivals at similar price points, especially in highest selling price points of Rs 5 and Rs 10.According to market researcher Euromonitor, sweet and savoury snacks have grown by 26%, highest within packaged food segment between 2010 and 2015. About four years ago, packaged namkeen had replaced western snacks such as potato chips and finger sticks as the largest segment within branded salty snacks market.""Domestic manufacturers are increasing their distribution and penetration into rural India and have launched smaller packs at lower price points,"" Euromonitor said in a recent report.The research firm expects the salty snacks segment to surpass biscuits with sales of nearly Rs 35,801 crore by 2020, up from Rs 19,151 crore in 2015.Funding from private equity funds helped domestic snacking firms to expand their reach and market their products more aggressively, experts said.""There has been an impetus on brand building and geographical expansion by these regional firms. Their variants launches have been faster compared to large food companies,"" said Devendra Chawla, president, food & FMCG, at the country's leading retailer Future Group.Prataap Snacks, maker of Yellow Diamond chips, was backed by Sequoia and has filed papers for an initial public offering (IPO) to raise Rs 400 crore.The company, which clocked 35% growth in sales last year at.`758 crore, recently roped in actor Salman Khan to promote its brand. Nearly two years ago, private equity fund Lighthouse Funds had invested Rs 125 crore in Bikaji Foods while WestBridge Capital Partners picked up a 25% stake in DFM Foods that sellssnack foods under the brand Crax.It may be difficult for these domestic players to maintain their growth momentum though as larger rivals are entering their turf with similar pricing and products. Parle Products, ITC and PepsiCo have all launched similar range as smaller regional players in the past few years.""No doubt, regional brands offer better value for money. But as we enter their region and expand our portfolio, their growth rate might taper off,"" said B Krishna Rao, deputy marketing manager at Parle Products."
345,Distress sale by potato hoarders as stocks arrive,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Distress-sale-by-potato-hoarders-as-stocks-arrive/articleshow/56092500.cms,2016-12-21,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: A section of potato farmers , who hoarded the crop in cold storage till the last moment to reap a windfall, is now resorting to distress sale of their stock. Liquidity crunch and fresh supply of potato from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have changed the game altogether. The wholesale price of Jyoti variety of potato crashed to Rs 2-3 per kg at markets closed to cold storages across Bengal. However, the crash has a little impact on the retail markets in the city.This year saw the least potato production  9 million tonne  in Bengal compared to earlier years. So, many farmers and middlemen calculated a good price if they managed to hoard a substantial amount of potato. A section of farmers, middlemen and cold-storage owners fudged this year's actual storage to jack up the price. So, when the actual storage was 6.5 million tonnes across 462 potato cold storages in Bengal, it was shown only 3 million tonne. This led to abnormal rise of potato price in both wholesale and retail markets.Potato economy of Bengal is always erratic. It is one of the most risky farming bets. With a contribution of 25% in India's potato output, Bengal is the second-largest producer of the vegetable after UP. ""A section of middlemen and traders speculate the probable price of potato every year, keeping in mind the production of potato and its price in previous years. But things often go haywire when ground reality changes,"" said Shankar Adhikari , an agriculture economist.November 30 was the last date for clearing entire stock. But government found a huge stockpile of potato in the cold storages. Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta extended the last date of clearing the stock till December 8. But even after that the government found a huge stock uncleared. Now that section of farmers and middlemen find it difficult to withdraw the stock from cold storages as the cost overshoots the wholesale price.Paschimbanga Potato Traders Association president Swapan Samanta said: ""Liquidity crunch along with fresh supply of low-cost potato from Punjab has changed the game. Bengal potato now has hardly any buyer. The potato retail price now should be below Rs 8 in Kolkata's retail markets."" Traders are jostling to sell before the new crop arrives in December end, failing which the old one must be destroyed."
346,"Foodgrain output may scale peak next year, agriculture growth at 5.5%",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/foodgrain-output-may-scale-peak-next-year-agri-growth-at-5-5-4438619/,2016-12-21,Indian Express,"Although agri-experts have raised concerns about impact of demonetisation on rabi crops and the likely effect of forecast of warm winter on wheat crop, the secretary said the government is not downgrading the target for 2016-17 crop year. Although agri-experts have raised concerns about impact of demonetisation on rabi crops and the likely effect of forecast of warm winter on wheat crop, the secretary said the government is not downgrading the target for 2016-17 crop year.The agriculture sector is all set to bounce back leaving two years of drought behind and may well pull off record foodgrain output of 270 million tonnes in 2016-17 on good rains, but farmers woes may continue due to adverse impact of notes ban and low sales realisation. The farm growth is estimated to rise at over 5 per cent this fiscal, from 1.2 per cent in the previous year, on the back of record kharif foodgrain production at 135 million tonnes (mt) and likely bumper output in the ongoing rabi season, helped by good monsoon in most parts of the country.The agriculture sector has done well during the year. We received good monsoon after facing the drought year. Kharif in general was very good and rabi sowing has been brisk. We are hopeful of bumper production this year, Agriculture Secretary Shobhana Pattanayak told PTI in an interview.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAlthough agri-experts have raised concerns about impact of demonetisation on rabi crops and the likely effect of forecast of warm winter on wheat crop, the secretary said the government is not downgrading the target for 2016-17 crop year.Our target is to achieve foodgrain production of 270 million tonnes while our last peak production was 265.04 mt in 2013-14 crop year (July-June), he said.Agriculture sector growth was lower last year because of drought. But from that level, we will move higher.On farm sector growth, NITI Aayog Member Ramesh Chand said: It will be spectacular growth after facing two drought years. We are expecting a growth of 5.5 per cent this year.The growth rate of agriculture and allied sectors will be 5.3 per cent even if wheat productivity throughout the country is lower by 3 per cent due to rise in temperature, he said.Asked about adverse impact of demonetisation on farmers, Pattanayak said there is not much impact as the credit system has been strong in rural areas and farmers have become more resilient over the years.Our farmers have witnessed very strong drought in last two years and yet they have bounced back. I dont think it has really impacted, he said.However, farmers organisations as well as former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar have expressed deep concern about impact of demonetisation, saying farmers are unable to buy quality seeds and fertilisers for their rabi crop and are also facing problems in selling crops for want of demand.Despite record kharif production this year and expected good crop in the rabi season, farmers conditions continue to be grim due to lower sales realisation, with domestic and global commodity prices staying depressed.The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has also affected the domestic demand of fruits and vegetables, forcing farmers to sell their produce at throwaway price.About farmers woes, agri-economist Ashok Gulati said: This year, production is likely to bounce back and therefore, much better than last year. However, farmers are already under debt. And prices of cotton, basmati rice and, with demonetisation, many fresh fruits and vegetables are depressed. Because of that, despite higher production levels, farmers have not gained much.2016 began on a sticky note as the countrys overall foodgrain output remained flat at 252 mt in 2015-16 crop year due to second straight year of drought.Pulse output fell to 16.5 mt resulting in high prices for most part of the year that kept the government on its toes, which took various steps to cool prices and bring relief to consumers.The measures like domestic procurement and import to boost local supplies helped ease the prices of tur and urad from about Rs 200 a kg, but chana continues to rule high.As per the official estimate, wheat output rose to 93.55 mt, from 86 mt, but FCIs procurement fell sharply and domestic prices of wheat and its products began to rise towards the end of the year. The government scrapped import duties on wheat to boost domestic supply.To provide relief to farmers hit by the cash crunch, the government has given them an additional two months to repay their crop loans due in November-December and said prompt repayment will be eligible for the extra 3 per cent interest subsidy.The government had earlier allowed farmers to buy seeds through old Rs 500 notes from central and state-owned seed companies as well as from ICAR and central varsities. It had also asked fertiliser companies to sell soil nutrient on credit basis to farmers.To check food inflation, import duties on palm oils and potatoes were reduced. Stock limit on sugar mills were also imposed to check prices although improved domestic rates helped industry clear arrears to farmers.The year also saw the successful rollout of the landmark National Food Security Act (NFSA) across the country. Programmes like new crop insurance scheme and eNAM to link all 585 mandis on an electronic trading platform were announced to augment farmers income.In this years budget, the government raised agri-credit by Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 9 lakh crore for the current fiscal and levied 0.5 per cent Krishi Kalyan cess on all taxable services to fund farm initiatives.Eminent scientist M S Swaminathan hailed the new schemes, but stressed on proper implementation. He also wanted the government to pay farmers 50 per cent more than the production cost as part of the minimum support price (MSP).Expressing concern over poor implementation of agri schemes, Gulati, the former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, said: The government should focus completely on agriculture and try to implement some of the programmes properly.The year also witnessed the government fixing the maximum retail price and royalty for cotton seeds, including Bt cotton, based on its order issued at the fag end of 2015.The move was opposed by biotechnology firms while the domestic seed manufacturers were in favour of the decision. Global biotechnology major Monsanto threatened to re-evaluate its India business. It plans to introduce new products, besides entering into the legal battle against this order.However, NCP supremo Pawar recently attacked the NDA government for taking such a move, saying Indian agriculture is being brought back to licence and control raj which is detrimental to the growth of the sector.The government of the day should not have hostility to improve systems and technologies, he said, adding that the government is overly cautious on the technology front.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

On an average, the cost of production for potato is Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per kg, but the farmer is getting way below it, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu .Same time last year, farmers were getting around Rs. 600 per 50 kg, he said.The new season potato crop from the Kandi belt, including Hoshiarpur and neighbouring districts of Punjab and also Una district in Himachal Pradesh, has started arriving in the markets but farmers are finding it difficult to sell their crop in the absence of buyers.Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in a drop in bulk orders from big markets like Delhi. In local markets there are a fewer buyers and hence farmers are getting a far lower price, Mr. Sangha said, adding that the potato grower had earlier suffered losses due to drop in sale of seeds and now again when the fresh crop has reached the market.Potato growers from Punjab on Wednesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to waive off their crop loans.Clash with peak seasonWhile we appreciate the governments [demonetisation] move, we have suffered huge losses. Potato seed farming business accounts for nearly Rs. 1,500 crore annually, but this year we are estimating a loss to the tune of Rs. 800-900 crore, he said, adding that demonetisation had clashed with the peak season of potato seed when it is supplied nationwide.Notably, Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country, including in West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Potato seed is supplied from the first week of November to mid-December every year. In neighbouring Haryana, the situation is no different as farmers are forced to sell potato at a dismal price on account of poor demand."

The Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) has sent back trucks bringing in the Indore and Agra variety potatoes.Yes, potato arrivals from outside the State were stopped today and we are sending back such stocks, said B.M. Srinivasa, Joint Director, Department of Agricultural Marketing and Secretary of APMC, Belagavi.The decision was taken when farmers prevented unloading of potatoes from trucks that had arrived from other States and also organised a rasta roko agitation on the APMC Road for nearly four hours.

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply.

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg.

Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply.

File PHOTOVegetable farmers in Punjab and Haryana are going through yet another period of hardship as the wholesale price of the seasonal crops has hit the rock bottom, forcing farmers into distress sale.Farmers and officials told The Hindu that with the harvesting season picking up, the supply of green peas, cauliflower, potato, carrot and tomatoes had increased. But the demand is subdued because of the poor cash availability.Farmers have not been able to recover even the production cost.At the Amritsar vegetable market, price of green peas on Moday was down to Rs. 4 a kg, well below the production cost of Rs. 6 a kg. Farmers blamed the poor returns on the increased supply and demonetisation.Cash crunch impactGreen pea prices are so low that I wont even recover the input cost , said Jagbir Singh Maan, a farmer from Manawal Kalan in Amritsar. He said traders were offering low prices, citing subdued demand and the cash crunch post-demonetisation.In the fruit and vegetable market in Chandigarh, the wholesale prices of fresh vegetables have slumped because of the rise in supply and low demand.Rajinder Kumar, secretary of the Chandigarh Market Committee, said in the past week, potato prices ruled at Rs. 5-10 a kilogram. I have been supplying vegetables in bulk to hotels in Chandigarh, but since demonetisation, the orders have gone down by 30 per cent, said Deepak Dhawan, who is a commission agent in the Chandigarh market.The wholesale prices of all seasonal vegetables have dropped in the past month, he said.In the Jalandhar vegetable market, potatoes fetched a paltry Rs. 2 a kg on Monday. Prices are down but I dont have any other option than selling. If I delay, the quality of the potato will deteriorate. I have to sow wheat after potato harvest, hence, Im forced to sell my crop at a poor price, though it means a heavy loss, said Jaswinder Singh, a Jalandhar potato farmer.In Haryana too, farmers are selling seasonal vegetables at throw away prices. In the Shahbad market, potato fetched Rs. 2.75 a kg, while cauliflower went for Rs. 2 a kg. I sold my potato for Rs. 2.75 a kilogram.As the prices have dropped, farmers in my village have started feeding their potatoes to their cattle to avoid buying feed, said Rakesh Bains, a farmer from Kurukshetra, who planted potato on 24 acres.Farmers have been unable to recover cost of productionas the priceshave plummeted"

However, orange exporters are now being affected by the demonetisation of high-denomination Indian currency notes.Bhutanese orange exporters rue that because of the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in India, they are being charged high rates for boxes to pack their oranges in. Transporters are also demanding extra charges if paid in Ngultrum, currency of Bhutan.Orange exporters from Paro have been sending the fruit to India for the past decade. The yield and quality of the oranges this year are high but the demonetisation is affecting the business.A Bhutanese exporter, who wished not to be named, said the exporters have to pay ""miscellaneous"" and ""other unofficial bills"" in Indian currency. As an interim measure, the exporters have arranged with the transporters to pay in Ngultrum (Nu) with the assurance that they will be paid in INR once it is available.Exporters from Bhutan's Gelephu orange depot have been paying Nu 19,000 per truck to transport oranges till the Bangladesh border. But this year transporters are demanding more than Nu 20,000 per truck. The big oranges (meel) are fetching Nu 820 per box and the small oranges (keel) Nu 630 per box.Export of oranges started in November and lasts till February next year. Bhutanese officials point out that if Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) Motor Vehicle Agreement (MVA) were in place, Bhutanese trucks would be transporting oranges all the way to Bangladesh and orange exporters would not be paying Indian truckers inflated prices.Besides paying Indian truckers, orange exporters also need Indian currency to pay their labour and for boxes imported from India. Another fallout of the demonetisation process was the record low prices offered to potato farmers this year in Bhutan.India is and will always remain Bhutan's most important and easily accessible market but during emergencies, contingencies have to be in place to go directly to other markets beyond the neighbouring states, and perhaps even other countries like Bangladesh or Nepal, indicated officials in Thimpu."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Dec. 26: BJP general secretary Ram Madhav today alleged that Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh was ""playing politics"" over the ongoing indefinite economic blockade called by the United Naga Council. ""It is the Manipur chief minister who is playing politics on the issue with the narrow objective of winning some votes. It is very unfortunate that the lives of people of the valley have been thrown into such a difficult situation,"" Madhav told reporters on the sidelines of an organisational meeting of the Assam BJP here. Madhav said the Centre had been ready with security forces from day one. ""They (security forces) were available two months ago to him (Singh). They are available today. They could at least use those forces now and get the blockade cleared. He (Ibobi) is not doing it,"" the general secretary said. ""We have been constantly in touch with the state government and repeatedly telling the chief minister to use the available state and central forces. Union minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju visited the state the day before yesterday to tell the chief minister again that we are ready to give whatever support it wants. Constitutionally, the Centre is obliged to extend all support to state governments and it is the mandate of the state government to seek and secure support of the Centre. We have made forces available from day one,"" Madhav said. The Manipur BJP has been asking the Centre to do everything to remove the blockade, he added. Manipur continues to suffer from the blockade as petrol prices went upto Rs 120 to Rs 150 per litre in different places, cooking gas upto Rs 2,000 per cylinder and potatoes to Rs 35 per kg. Curfew is still on from 9pm to 4am in Imphal West and Imphal East districts. The state government was supposed to lift the ban on private Internet service providers on Christmas Day, but considering the situation, it is unlikely to be withdrawn till December 30. The Manipur BJP today appealed to the UNC to withdraw the blockade. Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas, Dharmendra Pradhan reviewed the position in Manipur in New Delhi today and directed the oil marketing companies (OMCs) to take all possible remedial measures to ease the situation, an official release said. The companies are moving supplies under heavy security protection via an alternative route (National Highway 35 via Jiribam) after shifting its supply base to Guwahati from Tinsukia. The companies and the ministry are in constant touch with the state government, which is coordinating the movement of supplies. A delegation of the All Manipur Working Journalists' Union, led by its president Wangkhemcha Shamjai, called on Union minister of state (independent charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) Jitendra Singh in New Delhi and discussed the prevailing unrest in Manipur. In a memorandum submitted to the DoNER minister, the journalists expressed concern over the hardships faced by the people of the state as a result of the economic blockade. According to them, media houses had been badly hit as a result of the UNC blockade, leading to an acute shortage of newsprint and other related material like printing plates. In addition, they alleged that the movement of reporters to collect news has got hampered due to fuel shortage. The Manipur BJP spokesperson, N. Biren Singh, told The Telegraph that there is a possibility of airlifting essential commodities if the situation demands."

Banks are estimated to have dispensed more than 6,500 crore as the currency chests were already in possession of cash prior to the demonetisation move. Six banks have their currency chests in Gurgaon.The shortage of cash is persisting but the banks are managing the situation by rationing the withdrawal limits. Banks have been demanding increased inflow of currency but it is not likely for a few months, Ramesh Chandra Nayak, lead bank manager for the district, said.A majority of the ATMs are still running dry and residents are apprehensive about the situation.There are several banks where there are no queues, but that is because they say they are out of cash. It seems that bank officials are forcing customers to return empty-handed despite having currency with them, Savita Khanna, a teacher waiting to get money from a private bank in Civil Lines, said.The Opposition leaders condemned the demonetisation move on Tuesday. Ajay Yadav, former minister and Congress leader, said that the decision has not been kind towards farmers. Farmers are forced to sell potatoes at 1 (per kg), tomatoes at 2 (per kg) and gooseberry as 3 (per kg) in the markets. They are throwing away their produce, as the market rates are not covering their production costs, Yadav said at the district Congress office in Kaman Sarai.TL Satyaprakash, the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG), said the focus is now on cashless transactions. He said the corporation is accepting only cashless payment of taxes, bills and other charges, through point-of-sale machines."
359,Veggie retail prices stay firm. Cartel to blame?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/veggie-retail-prices-stay-firm-cartel-to-blame/articleshow/56228988.cms,2016-12-29,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: While field prices of vegetables , including that of potato, have registered a slump, affecting wholesale rates , impact on the city retail markets is hardly visible. Vegetable prices have remained the same at all the Kolkata municipal markets , even after the shift in sales from the neighbourhood bazars to shopping malls during the initial days of demonetisation. Even the state task force team apparently couldn't get to the bottom of the reason.""There is a huge difference between wholesale and retail prices. We have brought it to the CM's notice. I fear there is a strong retail cartel in the city that has prevented any drop in rates even after wholesale prices started going down. There has also been a slump in field rates,"" said Bengal Vendors' Association president Kamal Dey . The high retail price doesn't quit sync with the supply scene as Bengal, like elsewhere in the country , had a bumper yield this year.Potato prices in the retail market range between Rs 10 and Rs 12 a kg, while its wholesale rate is pegged at Rs 7 a kg. What's more is that cold storages are auctioning the potato stocks at Rs 120-140 for a 50-kg packet, which comes down to Rs2.4-Rs 2.8 a kg. The marginal decrease in retail prices for some items is no match to the price crash during this part of the season. So much so that potato far mers at Tarakeswar are dumping their stocks because the prices they are getting is half the amount they spent on potato seeds for sowing.Other vegetable prices, too, defy the economics of demand-and-supply, with traders at Kolay Market wondering where and how were the perishable items stored to ensure a regulated supply . Prices of vegetables remained similar compared to that last year, even during the first few days of demonetisation. ""There was a fall in demand initially. Most people had to cut down on their daily budget. Retailers didn't compromise on prices even then,"" Dey said.The widening gap has prompted some farmers to shift to cultivating flowers. ""This may lead to a supply crunch, pushing prices up further,"" Dey said, adding the vegetable-to-flower shift could impact the food chain. ""We will start feeling the pinch from February . We may have to pay double for vegetables,"" Dey said."
360,Here's why rates of some vegetables are seeing a dip,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/heres-why-rates-of-some-vegetables-are-seeing-a-dip/articleshow/56228798.cms,2016-12-29,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Tomato and other vegetables prices, including those of onion and potato, have come down after demonetisation. But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato."

Speaking with TOI, citizens shared it has become difficult to fulfill family's wishes after demonetisation. We are consciously cutting down on extra expenses on junk eatables, soft drinks, chocolates etc, they added.The restriction on cash withdrawal has led to people cutting down on spending at grocery stores. Anoop, who is fond of buying chips and snacks, said, ""I love keeping extra packets of chips, wafers and juices in my house. But after demonetisation, I cannot afford to spend lavishly on food. So I have curtailed on junk food items.""Meenakshi Arora, a resident of Jopling Road, used to buy chocolates, noodles and toffees in bulk from a nearby departmental story for her children.But post demonetisation, she is buying only goods which are a must in the kitchen. ""I have to refuse my children every time they ask for chocolates. I feel so helpless for not being able to fulfill my children's wishes despite having a good income.""Meanwhile, the prices of vegetables like potatoes, onions, tomatoes and peas have come down by more than 50%.While potatoes have dropped to Rs 10 per kg from Rs 20, rate of peas has reduced from Rs 45 to just Rs 20. Tomatoes' and onions' prices have also fallen by 50% because of cash crunch.Surabhi, a resident of Vikasnagar, said, ""Most ATMs are dispensing Rs 2,000 notes which vegetable vendors refuse to accept. We don't have change so vendors are forced to sell their vegetables on credit and at a lower price.""Since seasonable vegetables perish soon, even mandis are selling them at a discounted rate. ""Every second buyer complains of having no change. We have no option but to sell at cheap rates to clear the stock,"" said Rajan Singh, a seller at Narhi mandi.Another vegetable vendor, Gaurav Raikwar, from Unnao said he was selling green peas and cauliflowers on a negligible profit because no one was ready to buy them at standard prices."

But, much to their dismay, prices have crashed to Rs. 10 a kg.In this situation, many have not sold their produce. Three truckloads of potato have remained unsold in our village, said Papaiah, a farmer from Marenahalli near Mosale Hosahalli in Hassan taluk. But the stock has started to perish forcing some of them to sell at Rs. 4 a kg. The case of maize growers is no different. The price of maize has dropped to Rs. 1,300-1,400 a quintal from the level of Rs. 1,600-1,700 before demonetisation. Also, farmers have to bear transportation cost as traders have stopped farm-gate purchases after demonetisation in most of the areas.The coffee growers are also hit as demonetisation has coincided with the harvest season. A coffee planter with 25 acres of plantation needs to pay wages of about Rs. 45,000 a week as he hires about 25 labourers. But, one can only withdraw a maximum of Rs. 24,000 a week from the banks, say planters.U.M. Thirthamallesh, secretary of the Karnataka Coffee Growers Federation, says, Because of the cash crisis, planters are hiring less number of workers this year, resulting in delayed picking, which may affect the quality of coffee beans, besides harming the plants in the long run. In northern districts like Kalaburagi, farm labourers have started demanding a part of the harvested produce as their wages instead of accepting money, as several landlords are trying to give them old currency notes.What has added to the woes of farmers is that most of the ATMs in rural areas have remained closed due to paucity of cash."

Much to the dismay of many who were planning to let their hair down on New Year's Eve, the Kochi cops recently announced that they will have none of this party business, (it's western culture, after all!) and issued a string of unfounded rules, all in the name of making celebrations ""more family-friendly"" and sanskari . No mercy for ""ahankari"" hipsters here, in God's Own Country. So what if all they want to do is just let some steam off and well, enjoy what's left of the year in the way they deem fit. The cops, who seem excited to play poopers this year, have pretty much made Kochi city feel like a boarding school, say the livid revelers. While the public is obviously feeling outraged, the cops have no plans whatsoever to relax their rules. Even as they turn a deaf ear to the ones who are young ones who are crying hoarse about their 'right to party', Kochi Times catches up with Arul B Krishna: District Commissioner of Police, to understand why his squad is hell bent on ruining this party.We, the police, aren't stopping you from partying. We aren't asking the public to shut inside the house on New Year Eve. We want to spread the message of responsible celebration in Kochi. Let us usher a party culture where families too can enjoy. We aren't stopping anybody, but we want people to be responsible and avoid drugs. You ask any family man in Kochi, if he prefers to party in the city on New Year night, he would say 'no'. Because he considers it not safe. We want to change that perception.While studying the reasons on the increased incidents of crime on New Year's Eve, we found that the DJ parties are providing conducive environments for drug abuse and also molestation. I have seen many instances, where women who faced abuse during such events, refused to open up. So what we felt is that everybody has the right to party, not just those who love to get intoxicated and make mischief. I know that the youngsters would not take it in the right sense but it is a request from our side to provide a safe New Year celebration to all. Let me add that this is not a rule but advisory in nature. There are hoteliers and DJs, who have come forward to co-operate with us, understanding the spirit.It has to be noted that there are no restrictions for house parties, and we are only concerned about the parties happening in public places.We spoke to a few people and we found that the dark room psychology works well in dim lights. Darkness conceals identity and also decreases inhibitions; as a result, it may lead to crimes. The liberating feeling amid darkness has been observed among a lot during dim light DJ parties.We know that while making these rules stricter, some might have already planned drug parties in isolated areas. We have a very dedicated Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) team to track them down.Our Pink Patrol team will be doubly active on New Year eve. We will be posting 1500 policemen throughout the city, at hotels, Fort Kochi and even on the roads, to ensure safe celebrations. Women can access the Pink Patrol by contacting 1515.We aren't being strict; instead we are actually forced to do this due to the increased amount of drug being pumped into the city. We have got strong intelligence inputs from the excise and from our sources that a huge amount of narcotics is being brought into the city, particularly for this New Year Eve parties. A pinch of drug that starts off as a mode to have more fun can become an addiction later.In the past one year, we had 1,300 cases on NDPS and we have arrested 1,700 people just from the Kochi city area. The use of narcotic substances and drug abuse have become very rampant. We are strictly trying to implement the laws on drug abuse. Also, we went through the records of 2014, 2015 and 2016. Around the same time last year, there were 29 accidents and two deaths reported during this period. Those who lost their lives were innocent people, who were hit by the intoxicated party-hard kinds.This year, from December 23 to 26, we caught more than 200 people for drunken driving. If this trend continues, the number of cases will cross thousand by December 31.Considering all these instances, we have come up with a strategy to ensure zero accidents and zero incidents.Meanwhile, Kochiites react to the decision:'Those who proclaimed freedom are now enchaining us'Festivals are to celebrate. Celebrations are very important to have a calm and peaceful society. What if tomorrow, the government gives us orders on how to celebrate Onam, Christmas and even Eid? It is like restricting the freedom of human beings. I guess, for the ruling party, the New Year begins at 10 pm not at 12 am! The leaders who once proclaimed freedom are now enchaining us. This is all because of the poverty in thoughts and attitude. If they have to make the rules stricter, they should do it in places where there is blood shed for political gain, and not on anybody's freedom to celebrate.'The duty of police is to ensure public safety and not restrict their freedom'I am not a party freak but I believe everyone has the right to celebrate New Year in their own ways. The more the police try to clamp down, the more the public will try to break free. These stricter rules will annoy the public and the number of house parties will increase. This would also create disturbances in the neighbourhood. I think the duty of police is to ensure safety and security of the public and not restrict their freedom. New Year is a universal celebration and I am totally against controlling one from celebrating it in their own style.'I hope they don't take away our right to scream when the clock strikes 12'We all have the freedom to express and enjoy. New Year Eve is looked forward by many with a lot of hope, expectations and dreams. If we can party responsibly, then no one can stop us. I wish the government could give us some positive news in addition to imposing rules. We are already depressed due to the impact of demonetisation, now I hope they don't take away our right to scream when the clock strikes 12.'The authorities are trying to crumble the society by curbing all means of fun'When the restrictions increase, the tendency to break away from it also go up. Will the crime rate reduce just because the rules are made stricter? Most of the Malayalis only party during New Year and now due to this last minute restrictions, I guess we will have a dull New Year this time. The authorities are trying to crumble the society by curbing all means of fun. Guess we will end up being boring couch potatoes who can't party or enjoy."
